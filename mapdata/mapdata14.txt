Zika virus replication in the mosquito _Culex quinquefasciatus_ in Brazil. Emerg Microbes Infect. 2017; 6(8): e69. doi: 10.1038/emi.2017.<br><br><strong>59  Abstract </strong><br> Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has recently been associated with an increased incidence of neonatal microcephaly and other neurological disorders. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito bite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some cases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main vector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other mosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the virus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit ZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of laboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. Interestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the midgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in Recife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially fed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx. quinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced. Collectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range of ZIKV vectors than anticipated.  <br><br>Communicated by: Roland Hübner Superior Health Council Brussels Belgium Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active virus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their ability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step toward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_ fed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in saliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing. The study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a competent vector. Several other studies have shown this species to be inefficient vectors or refractory to Zika virus infection. One wonders if the specific _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ used or the Zika virus isolates with which they were tested could account for these very different results. Resolving these discrepancies is important because this mosquito species is very widely distributed around the world and bears directly on risk of outbreaks in geographic areas where _Aedes aegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_ , Zika virus vectors, do not occur. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"91":{"title":"Chikungunya (27) - Americas, Europe, Asia ","date":["18","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Chikungunya (27) - Americas, Europe, Asia [EXTERNAL]","summary":"<br><br><strong> Cases in various countries: Regional summaries - Americas -</strong><br> WHO/PAHO report 18 Aug 2017 Reported cases of chikungunya fever in the Americas, by country or territory - 2017 to EW 33 week ending 18 Aug 2017.

Given the outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections in the region, and the clinical similarity of cases of that virus infection and CHIKV infection, one wonders how many cases that were not laboratory confirmed but clinically diagnosed as ZIKV infections were, in reality, CHIKV infections. It is also possible that a significant proportion of the population have been infected by CHIKV in the previous 3 years and are now immune. It seems likely, however, that CHIKV is now endemic in the Americas, and sporadic, small outbreaks may continue to occur as they do in Asia and Africa. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Armenia":{},"Aruba":{},"Australia":{"68":{"title":"Mumps update (24): Australia (QL), New Zealand (OT),\r\n\tBrazil (AM) ","date":["18","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Mumps update (24): Australia (QL), New Zealand (OT),\r\n\tBrazil (AM) [EXTERNAL]","summary":" 3 Brazil (Manaus, Amazonas)  Fri 18 Aug 2017 Source: Em Tempo in Portuguese, trans. & summ., edited With 230 cases of mumps in Manaus Amazonas state in 19 places, registered since April 2017, mainly in schools, the Municipal Health Department (Semsa) warns parents to keep the updated immunization booklet for children and adolescents.

This was confirmed upon receipt of laboratory results from test samples that were sent to Australia. Agriculture officials were quick to assure, however, that the strain is slow to spread and causes few deaths. \"The rate of transmission is very, very low,\" Arlene Vytiaco, who heads animal disease control in the Bureau of Animal Industry, said in a press briefing on Thursday. She explained that countries like Japan and Myamnar have been affected by H5N6 but have reported no humans infected by the avian influenza. \"The mortality rate is also low,\" Vytiaco said. Since H5N6 started in 2014, only 20 deaths have been reported worldwide. The Department of Health has been conducting regular check-ups on farmers and workers in areas hit by the bird flu outbreak. Vytiaco said no new patients have been admitted since 2 farm workers reported flu-like symptoms last week week of Sun 13 Aug 2017 but eventually tested negative for bird flu. The government had been waiting to see what the bird flu's specific N strain was - particularly on the lookout for the N1 and N6 strains, which can be passed on to humans. Local tests had confirmed it was not the far deadlier H5N1 virus. However, it had to send samples to Australia to check whether it was H5N6, since the government did not have its own test kits here. This was said by Dr Arlene Vytiaco, who oversees disease control for the Bureau of Animal Industry. Reports of bird flu being present were 1st reported earlier this month August 2017. The virus was found in birds from 7 farms in San Luis, Pampanga. The Department of Agriculture DA earlier said the virus had been present since April 2017, but was only reported in August 2017 after 37 000 birds had died. It added the strain of avian flu present in these birds was not transmissible to humans.

Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world. A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries. Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years. \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\" \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea\". The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years 2 million DALYs since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln 13 million DALYs in the US, and 36-mln 36 million DALYs in Ethiopia. \"Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,\" continues Prof Melegaro \"our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population. Tailoring immunization campaigns to achieve measles eradication goals is essential and currently, for some countries, this means considering also the role of unprotected adolescents and young adults.

Septoria tritici blotch has built up to levels that could cause significant damage this year 2017. Agriculture Victoria cereal pathologist Grant Hollaway said septoria is now the major fungal disease issue in south-west Victoria. \"It has really emerged as a problem over the past five or six years.\" He said the major threat would be in the medium rainfall zone where the disease had not been spotted for many years. \"Septoria was common in the Wimmera in low levels last year 2016 and this has provided the carryover inoculum.\" There are parallels in septoria's reappearance after a lengthy absence with that of stripe rust, which Dr Hollaway said returned to Victoria in 2003 following a 20 year hiatus. \"It is more of a stripe rust in terms of the damage it can cause,\" he said. Byline: Gregor Heard  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Septoria leaf blotch of cereals is caused by fungi in the septoria species complex, which includes _Zymoseptoria tritici_ (previously _Septoria tritici_), _Mycosphaerella graminicola_ and _Phaeosphaeria nodorum_ (previously _Stagonospora nodorum_). They affect mainly wheat, but also barley and oats and occasionally rye and some grass species. Symptoms on wheat and barley are very similar and may occur at any time during the growth cycle and on any portion of the plant. They include blotches on both leaves and glumes, which reduce the photosynthetic ability of the host. Disease development is favoured by humid conditions. Up to 50 per cent yield losses have been reported on susceptible varieties. Spores can be spread by infected plant material, wind, water (rain splash) and mechanical means. The pathogens can overwinter on crop debris and on autumn sown crops or volunteers. Disease management includes fungicide treatments aimed at preventing the disease becoming established on the upper 3 leaves of the crop canopy (where it would affect the ears most), removal of inoculum sources and use of resistant varieties. After the cereal rusts, the disease is considered the most important challenge to plant breeders (see ProMED-mail post http://promedmail.org/post/20120831.1274190) and a threat to food security worldwide. Pathogen strains with high levels of resistance to many fungicides are emerging, for example, in the UK and other parts of Europe (ProMED-mail post http://promedmail.org/post/20160516.4225677), as well as Australia and New Zealand (ProMED-mail posts http://promedmail.org/post/20161031.4598540, http://promedmail.org/post/20140417.2410219).

The possibility cannot be excluded that the re-emergence of STB in eastern Australia may be due to new fungal strains which have adapted to local conditions. Stripe rust (_Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_), also mentioned above, can result in yield losses of 40 to 100 per cent. New strains with increased virulence are emerging and this disease is currently causing the most damage to wheat crops on a global scale.

An average of 0.4 cases of EHEC illness per 100 000 persons per year are reported to public health authorities in Australia (2). Disease severity can range from asymptomatic infection to serious and sometimes fatal illness, particularly in young children and the elderly (3,4). Healthy ruminants, particularly cattle, are the reservoir for EHEC (5). Human infection with EHEC usually occurs as a result of inadvertent ingestion of fecal matter after consumption of contaminated food, water, or unpasteurized milk; contact with animals or their environments; or secondarily, through contact with infected humans (4,5). In the largest previously reported outbreak of EHEC illness in Australia in 1995, which was associated with consumption of mettwurst (uncooked, semidry, fermented sausages), HUS developed in 23 of the 51 case-patients identified, and there was 1 death (6).<br><br><strong> The Study -</strong><br> A multidisciplinary incident management team was established to investigate an outbreak of EHEC illness associated with an annual agricultural show in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, in August 2013. The incident management team defined primary and secondary outbreak cases. Persons with laboratory-confirmed EHEC infection associated with the outbreak and their household contacts were followed up until the point of microbiological evidence of clearance, which was defined as 2 consecutive negative stool samples collected more than 24h apart (7). Case-patients and contacts with a high risk for transmission (persons under 5 years of age; persons unable to maintain good hygiene; or childcare, healthcare, aged care, or food preparation workers) were advised to avoid childcare and work settings in accordance with Queensland Health Guidelines (7). Enhanced surveillance measures were implemented to assist with case finding. Medical practitioners were requested to avoid use of antimicrobial drugs for suspected case-patients with EHEC infections because of previously reported associations between antimicrobial drug use and HUS. We developed a case-control study to obtain additional information related to animal contact, hand hygiene, and food consumption at the agricultural show. We analyzed data by using Epi Info 7 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA). EHEC identified from human, environmental, and animal samples were serotyped for O and H antigens. Expression of Shiga toxin 1 (stx1) and stx2 genes was determined for selected isolates. Shiga toxin gene subtyping and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis was performed. During 21 Aug 2013 to 27 Sep 2013, we identified 57 outbreak-associated laboratory-confirmed case-patients with EHEC infection: 54 confirmed primary case-patients, 1 probable primary case-patient, and 2 secondary case-patients (Figure 1 for figures, see original URL - Mod.

It may well be the case that the IS1203v insertion that resulted in deletion of the first 494 bp of the stx2c subunit A gene may have been the cause of milder illness. Regarding azithromycin use, azithromycin and the carbapenem antimicrobial class are among a small group of antibacterials that do not appear to precipitate a higher risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome. Azithromycin was used for late clearance of the EHEC here and I have had anecdotal experience doing the same thing in an asymptomatic chronic carrier of EHEC O157 without any adverse effects. - Mod.LL   .

Given the outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections in the region, and the clinical similarity of cases of that virus infection and CHIKV infection, one wonders how many cases that were not laboratory confirmed but clinically diagnosed as ZIKV infections were, in reality, CHIKV infections. It is also possible that a significant proportion of the population have been infected by CHIKV in the previous 3 years and are now immune. It seems likely, however, that CHIKV is now endemic in the Americas, and sporadic, small outbreaks may continue to occur as they do in Asia and Africa. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Barbados":{},"Belarus":{},"Belgium":{"62":{"title":"Zika virus (16): Americas, Asia, research,\r\n\tobservations ","date":["17","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Zika virus (16): Americas, Asia, research,\r\n\tobservations [EXTERNAL]","summary":" 11 _Culex quinquefasciatus_ as vectors  Wed 9 Aug 2017 Source: Emerging Microbes & Infections edited ref: Guedes DR, Paiva MH, Donato MM, et al.

Ciguatera poisoning, which causes symptoms such as tingling and numbness in fingers and toes, around lips, tongue, mouth and throat; nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and/or abdominal cramps; joint pains and headache; and breathing difficulty, has also been reported in Belize, and over the past 4 days, 2 alerts have been issued by the Ministry of Health in Belize, following reports of cases cropping up, which have been linked to the consumption of barracuda fish. In the 1st alert, issued on Fri 18 Aug 2017, the Ministry of Health reported that \"suspected fish poisoning (Ciguatera poisoning) was detected in people that had eaten fish bought from a fish vendor in Ladyville, Belize District.\" In the 2nd alert, issued on Tue 23 Aug 2017, the Ministry said that 2 further cases of suspected Ciguatera poisoning, linked to the consumption of the large predatory fish, had been identified. \"Investigations conducted so far reveal that the barracuda fish from the Turneffe Islands area has been the sole carrier of the ciguaxtoin or poison,\" the alert said. It warned that toxic fish does not have any odor or taste and cooking and freezing does not eliminate the toxin. According to the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ciguatera fish poisoning (or ciguatera) is an illness caused by eating fish that contain toxins produced by a marine microalgae called _Gambierdiscus toxicus_, associated with corals. Whereas the barracuda is believed to be the culprit for the most recent bouts of illness caused by the toxin, other fish may also carry the toxin, including coral trout, red snapper, donu, parrot fish, grouper, Spanish mackerel, red emperor, wrasse, reef cod, sturgeon fish, trevally and moray eel. The CDC also lists blackfin snapper, cubera snapper, dog snapper, greater amberjack, hogfish, horse-eye jack, and king mackerel among the fish which have been known to carry ciguatoxins. \"Anyone who consumes fish contaminated with the ciguatera toxin will become ill,\" the Ministry's alert said, adding that, \"The gastrointestinal or stomach symptoms normally appear within 24 hours of exposure and those of the nervous system can appear 1 to 2 days later.\" Although some symptoms may last only a few days, in some cases, the toxin can continue to affect those who ingest it for months. The CDC says people who have ciguatera may find that cold things feel hot and hot things feel cold. The Belize Ministry of Health has shared some guidelines for reducing the risk of CFP. It advises the following: - Avoid eating larger reef fish that have a greater likelihood of carrying ciguatoxins, especially the barracuda. - Limit the weight of a fish to less than 11 pounds, as ciguatera fish poisoning occurs more frequently in larger fish. - Eat other types of fish not listed above. - Avoid eating the head, roe or fish egg, liver, or other organs of the fish, as it is where the highest level of toxin is present.

The 1st 2 cases of cholera were tested positive by National Institute of Health Islamabad on Mon 31 Jul 2017 and another 2 confirmed positive for the infection on Fri 4 Aug 2017. All the 4 patients were undergoing treatment at Benazir Bhutto Hospital BH where as many as 4 more suspects of the infection have been admitted for treatment. Data collected by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017 reveals that the allied hospitals have sent stool samples of over 10 child patients to NIH for confirmation of cholera in last week week of Sun 6 Aug 2017. On Sat 12 Aug 2017, as many as 20 child patients with severe diarrhoea were admitted at the BBH of which 4 were suspected as patients of cholera and their stool samples were sent to NIH for confirmation, said Associate Professor of Paediatrics at Rawalpindi Medical University Dr Tariq Saeed when contacted by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017. He added the hospital has not received confirmation reports from the NIH because of holidays there from Saturday to Monday. However, we have been keeping the suspects in isolation under strict monitoring, he said. He added that repeated rainfalls in the region and water inundation inside and outside homes in a number of localities particularly in thickly populated areas of the city are causing contamination of water and foodstuff that increases chances of spread of a number of infections among population while children are at greater risk of contracting life-threatening infections including cholera. It is important that the transmission of cholera occurs primarily by drinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the feces (waste product) of an infected person, including one with no apparent symptoms. It is observed that heavy rainfall causes collection of heavily contaminated water in streets and houses and the waste water flooding out of various nullahs watercourses including Nullah Leh in town causes infections including cholera, typhoid, dysentery, gastroenteritis, hepatitis A and E, shigellosis and giardiasis. Professor Tariq said the consumption of contaminated water and foodstuff causes cholera, an infection in the small intestine caused by bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. Its main symptoms are watery diarrhea and vomiting that can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, and death in cases which are not treated in time, he said. Health experts say that to avoid cholera and other infections, one must use boiled water for drinking and should use vegetables after washing with clean water and it must be kept in mind that raw vegetables should not be eaten in the existing weather conditions instead these should be used after cooking. To a query, Professor Tariq said the heavy rainfall and water accumulation may contaminate water at sources and there may be chances of contamination of water at tube wells so individuals must boil water before drinking to avoid cholera and other infections. He added the appearance of cholera is alarming and it is time for people to take extra ordinary preventive measures to safeguard their children and themselves from the disease. In case water is accumulated inside home due to heavy rainfall and flooded out of sewage lines, it must be wiped out immediately and the space should be washed with clean water as soon as possible to avoid infections. Avoiding inundation of contaminated water inside homes is a must to avoid cholera and other infections, said Professor Tariq. Byline: Muhammad Qasim  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-SoAs Aggressive interventions to stem outbreaks of cholera include providing sources of clean water and a vaccination campaign. The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80 percent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:  - Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_; - Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65 percent (95 percent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam;  - Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however, have suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be effective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and outbreak situations (63, 64).<br><br><strong> \"References </strong><br> 57.

Multiple candidate Zika vaccines have been shown protective against infection with the virus in animal studies, with several now in human trials, but none were tested in the context of pregnancy, according to the authors of the study published in Cell  . The 2 vaccine candidates investigated in the new study are the 1st to demonstrate efficacy in preventing vertical transmission of the virus and related fetal death in an animal model. Although the vaccines were administered to female mice prior to pregnancy, the result is considered an important step toward developing a vaccine that could be safely given to pregnant women. One of the 2 candidates is a modified messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine encoding Zika genes, developed by the biotechnology company Moderna. It is already in safety trials in women who are not pregnant. The other is a live-attenuated Zika strain developed by researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). The testing was carried out by scientists from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Washington University School of Medicine, and UTMB. The researchers 1st vaccinated the mice with 1 of the vaccines or a placebo. After mating, the animals were challenged with the virus 6 days into pregnancy. A week later, more than 50 percent of placentas and fetuses from mice administered the mRNA vaccine had virtually no Zika RNA. The remainder had \"substantially lower\" levels relative to placebo. The live vaccine provided broader protection: 78 percent of placentas and 83 percent of fetuses had Zika RNA at or below the level of detection, while the placebo group exhibited significantly higher levels of placental and fetal Zika RNA. Mice vaccinated with either vaccine had significantly higher rates of fetal viability; whereas 100 percent of fetuses from mice vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine were born, none survived to term in the placebo group. A working group funded by the Wellcome Trust recently approved ethical guidelines for testing such vaccines in pregnant women, normally excluded from drug trials.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. It is reassuring to learn that at least 2 vaccines are now entering clinical trials in women.

Glanders has been eradicated from North American and was last reported in the United States in the 1940s. It's recently been reported in several areas around the world, however, including South America, Eastern Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and a rare case in Germany in 2014. Earlier this month August 2017, the 18-year-old Dutch Warmblood gelding Sagacious HF was shipped from Amsterdam to the Miami International Airport after participating in competitions in Sweden and England with Chase Hickok. Under USDA rules, all horses entering the United States, except those coming from Canada, must be quarantined and tested for 4 diseases  dourine, glanders, equine piroplasmosis, and equine infectious anemia  upon arrival. Jeanine Neskey, interim public affairs specialist for the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), said an animal that produces a positive test result is denied entry to the United States. \"Denied entry means that it must be either removed from the U.S. or be euthanized,\" she said. \"If the horse is denied entry into the U.S. (and not euthanized), the owner is free to take the horse to any other country that will accept it.\" Scott Leibsle, DVM, Idaho's deputy state veterinarian, said Sagacious could have contracted the disease through contaminated feed or through water buckets also used by other horses participating in competitions. The gelding might also have been an asymptomatic carrier of the disease, possibly developing signs after experiencing stress \"Transport is the most stressful thing you can do to a horse,\" he said. \"At the same time, you're putting it with new animals in a new area, and putting it under the stress of competition.\" Currently APHIS uses a complement fixation test (CFT) to detect glanders. However, the agency is evaluating other testing methods, including the Western Blot procedure. \"Advancing research and improved technology continue to develop new or improved testing methods for animal diseases,\" Neskey said. \"USDA routinely evaluates all testing methods available and incorporates the methods most appropriate to the needs of import quarantine testing.\" After Sagacious produced a 2nd positive CFT glanders test, he produced a negative Western Blot glanders test. Arrangements were made to place him on extended quarantine pending the results of additional testing with both tests, slated for Wed 23 Aug 2017. Byline: Pat Raia  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail Glanders, also known as farcy, is a contagious infectious disease of equines, acute or chronic, usually fatal, caused by the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_, and characterized by the development of ulcerated nodules that are most commonly found in the upper airway, lungs ,and skin. Felines and other animals are susceptible to infection, which is usually fatal. Humans can be infected and the microorganism (_B. mallei_) is considered a potential bioterrorism agent. The disease, one among the oldest known and that used to be prevalent worldwide, is currently eradicated or effectively controlled in many countries. Recently the disease has been reported in some countries, including Iraq, Turkey, Pakistan, India, Mongolia, China, Brazil, United Arab Emirates, and countries in Africa. Glanders is one of the diseases contained in the list of diseases for mandatory reporting to the World Animal Health Organization (OIE). The bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_ a clonal pathogen, can be found in nasal secretions and skin ulcers of infected animals. The transmission of glanders occurs commonly from intake of water or food contaminated with nasal secretions and exudates eliminated from infected animals, contact with contaminated equipment (saddles, harness) and by eating contaminated equine meat. In the nasal form, nodules arise in septum and turbinates. Nodules progress to irregular edged ulcers; star-shaped scars are characteristic after the resolution of the ulcers. In the early stage, submandibular lymph nodes are enlarged and edematous, adhering to the skin and deep tissues in advanced stages of the disease. In the pulmonary form, inflammatory nodules with caseous or calcified centers are found in the lungs. With the progression of the disease areas of consolidation and pneumonia may be present. The nodules may break and eliminate the inflammatory content into the bronchial tree, spreading the infection to the upper respiratory tract. In the cutaneous form, nodules arise along the lymphatic vessels, especially on the extremities. The nodules may degenerate to form ulcers with drainage of highly infectious purulent material. The liver and spleen may have typical nodular lesions. Histologically, vasculitis, thrombosis, inflammatory cell infiltration and degeneration can be seen. A test based on complement fixation can also be used for screening, but the ELISA test, although more sensitive, is not being routinely used. PCR can be used for specific identification ( ). There are no vaccines. Prevention and control depend on early detection and eliminating infected animals in addition to quarantine and complete disinfection. Treatment, administered only in endemic areas, which does not lead to microbiological cure, is the use of doxycycline, ceftazidime, gentamycin, or streptomycin. Sulfa drugs (including in combination with trimethoprim) seem to be effective in prevention and glanders treatment ( ). For glanders-free countries, there are OIE recommendations on importing equines. An international veterinary certificate is required attesting that the animals showed no clinical signs of glanders and were kept in an exporting country free of the disease for at least 6 months prior to shipment ( ). It appears foreign horse owners will not be able to comply, therefore will be unable to repatriate their show horses? Further information would be welcome. As a horse owner, this would be devastating. We certainly hope Sagacious test later this month August 2017 clears him of this disease. - Mod.TG   .

Emerg Microbes Infect. 2017; 6(8): e69. doi: 10.1038/emi.2017.<br><br><strong>59  Abstract </strong><br> Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has recently been associated with an increased incidence of neonatal microcephaly and other neurological disorders. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito bite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some cases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main vector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other mosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the virus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit ZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of laboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. Interestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the midgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in Recife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially fed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx. quinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced. Collectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range of ZIKV vectors than anticipated.  <br><br>Communicated by: Roland Hübner Superior Health Council Brussels Belgium Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active virus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their ability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step toward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_ fed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in saliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing. The study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a competent vector. Several other studies have shown this species to be inefficient vectors or refractory to Zika virus infection. One wonders if the specific _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ used or the Zika virus isolates with which they were tested could account for these very different results. Resolving these discrepancies is important because this mosquito species is very widely distributed around the world and bears directly on risk of outbreaks in geographic areas where _Aedes aegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_ , Zika virus vectors, do not occur. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"68":{"title":"Mumps update (24): Australia (QL), New Zealand (OT),\r\n\tBrazil (AM) ","date":["18","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Mumps update (24): Australia (QL), New Zealand (OT),\r\n\tBrazil (AM) [EXTERNAL]","summary":" 3 Brazil (Manaus, Amazonas)  Fri 18 Aug 2017 Source: Em Tempo in Portuguese, trans. & summ., edited With 230 cases of mumps in Manaus Amazonas state in 19 places, registered since April 2017, mainly in schools, the Municipal Health Department (Semsa) warns parents to keep the updated immunization booklet for children and adolescents.

Given the outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections in the region, and the clinical similarity of cases of that virus infection and CHIKV infection, one wonders how many cases that were not laboratory confirmed but clinically diagnosed as ZIKV infections were, in reality, CHIKV infections. It is also possible that a significant proportion of the population have been infected by CHIKV in the previous 3 years and are now immune. It seems likely, however, that CHIKV is now endemic in the Americas, and sporadic, small outbreaks may continue to occur as they do in Asia and Africa. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"99":{"title":"Yellow fever - Americas (56): French Guiana ","date":["22","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH/EDR> Yellow fever - Americas (56): French Guiana [EXTERNAL]","summary":"   Tue 22 Aug 2017, 11:43 PM Source: SFR France-Antilles in French, trans. Corr.SB, edited For the 1st time since 1998, a case of yellow fever has been confirmed in Guiana. It is a woman who stayed in the forest towards Saint-Élie and Oiapoque, in the border area with Brazil. The Institute Pasteur of Guiana yesterday Mon 21 Aug 2017 confirmed yellow fever virus infection in Guiana, for the 1st time since 1998. The infected person died on 9 Aug 2017. She could have been infected in the border area of Oiapoque in Brazil, according to the initial investigations of the ARS (Agence Regional de Santé; regional health agency). She had been in the forest near St Elie and in the Oyapock Valley. The mosquito control department of the CTG Collectivité Territoriale de Guyane  official name of French Guiana began its mosquito control operations around the identified places of transit of the deceased patient: the Cayenne hospital centre, the Kourou medical and surgical centre; the surrounding forest of Saint-Élie; degradation of Petit Saut; the lower Oyapock. The ARS recommends that unvaccinated people who present with symptoms and who have visited the area since 15 Aug 2017 should consult their doctor without delay. Unvaccinated people can be vaccinated at most general practitioners and at the following centres: - CPS of the Red Cross, - traveller centre or CDPS of the Centre Hospitalier de Cayenne, - PMI centers of the CTG. The ARS reminds all that vaccination is the main prevention measure against yellow fever.<br><br><strong> Transmission to humans, symptoms and treatments: </strong><br> Yellow fever is an acute viral disease transmissible from animal (monkey) to man and man to man by various mosquitoes (genus _Aedes_, but also other genera circulating in the forest). The yellow fever virus is transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito. After an incubation period of about one week, the disease is characterized by fever, chills, muscle pain, headache, nausea, vomiting. Severe forms (hemorrhage, liver disorders, kidney problems) can develop in 15 per cent of cases. Vaccination is the main prevention measure against yellow fever. The vaccine is safe, and very effective, a single dose is usually enough to give lasting immunity and lifetime protection against the disease. In 30 days, it gives an effective immune protection to 99 per cent of vaccinated subjects. In case of yellow fever, symptomatic treatment may be proposed (rehydration, antipyretic medicines to limit fever, vomiting and pain, antibiotics for superinfections). However, French Guiana is endemic for YF and the area where the woman was infected is forested and is likely to have foci of sylvan (forest) YF. Yellow fever was detected in 1951 in French Guiana and YF immunization has been compulsory there since 1967. In the year 2000, a cluster survey showed that immunization coverage in the population was estimated at 80-90 per cent, depending on the age category  . The last case of autochthonous YF notified in Guiana before the one cited above occurred in 1998 in a town on the border with Surinam. Since then, the compulsory notification system built around all health care structures and a reference laboratory at Cayenne's Pasteur Institute have received no notification of Yellow fever cases until now. Health authorities in French Guiana are wise to emphasize vaccination as the best preventive measure against YF. - Mod.TY   .

Oropouche has adapted to urban environments and is moving ever closer to Brazil's major cities. An arbovirus transmitted by a mosquito (like Zika and yellow fever), Oropouche causes acute fever and may lead to meningitis and meningoencephalitis (inflammation of the brain and meninges). \"Oropouche is a virus that could potentially emerge at any moment and cause a serious public health problem in Brazil,\" said Luiz Tadeu Moraes Figueiredo, a professor at the University of São Paulo's Ribeirão Preto Medical School (FMRP-USP). Figueiredo is a researcher for a Thematic Project supported by the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) focusing on emerging zoonotic viroses. According to him, about 500 000 cases of Oropouche fever have been reported in Brazil in recent decades but that the number of cases will grow because the virus, transmitted by the midge _Culicoides paraensis_, is no longer found only in Amazonian villages and is spreading to the big cities. \"_C. paraensis_ is distributed throughout the Americas, and Oropouche virus therefore has considerable emergence potential,\" he said. \"The virus may well spread from the Amazon region and central plateau to the most densely populated regions of the country.\" The incidence of Oropouche fever is also rising in urban areas of Peru and Caribbean countries. In Brazil, the virus has been isolated from birds in Rio Grande do Sul state and from a marmoset in Minas Gerais state. The presence of neutralizing antibodies (which bind to the virus, tell the immune system to destroy it, and prevent it from infecting the organism) has been detected in primates in the city of Goiânia Goiás state. \"We recently diagnosed a patient from Ilhéus city in the northeastern state of Bahia with Oropouche fever, in partnership with Eurico Arruda a professor in FMRP-USP's Department of Cellular Biology. This shows the virus is circulating around Brazil,\" Figueiredo said. In 2002, researchers at FMRP-USP diagnosed 128 people infected by Oropouche virus in Manaus, Amazonas state's capital city. They presented with typical symptoms of the infection, such as acute fever, joint pain, headache, and pain behind the eyes; 3 also developed a central nervous system infection. \"The virus was found in these patients' cerebrospinal fluid,\" Figueiredo said. The researchers were intrigued to find that one of these 3 patients had neurocysticercosis, an infection of the central nervous system caused by the pork tapeworm _Taenia solium_, and another had AIDS. \"This shows that some immunodepressive diseases can facilitate penetration of the central nervous system by the virus. Hardly anyone thinks of this when treating an arbovirus infection, but the possibility must be considered,\" Figueiredo said. The 128 patients with Oropouche in Manaus had been clinically diagnosed with dengue fever. The Oropouche and dengue viruses produce similar symptoms. For this reason, researchers at FMRP-USP and other institutions such as Fundação Oswaldo Cruz Fiocruz have begun to warn that many suspected cases of dengue in Brazil may be cases of infection by Oropouche. The report above indicates that it is spreading, as the biting midge vector, _Culicoides paraensis_, becomes more urbanized in its distribution. The results of blood samples taken in 20 municipalities in Amazonas state indicate the presence of the virus of Oropouche fever. This has been confirmed by Fiocruz Amazonia in an investigation carried out together with state health surveillance. The sampling corresponds to the 2011-2016 period. In total, 306 individuals were investigated, and 9 positives were found among them (see Oropouche virus - Brazil http://promedmail.org/post/20170814.5247798). Surveillance will need to be intensified, with corresponding laboratory support, to be able to differentiate Oropouche virus infection from infections caused by dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. Oropouche virus is a bunyavirus of the Simbu group. No vaccine is available, so avoidance of bites by the vector midge is the best preventive measure. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"190":{"title":"Glanders - Brazil: (TO) equine, human susp, RFI ","date":["23","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH/EDR> Glanders - Brazil: (TO) equine, human susp, RFI [EXTERNAL]","summary":"   Wed 23 Aug 2017 Source: G1 in Portuguese, machine trans., edited The cowboy working on the farm where a case of glanders was confirmed in a horse PRO/PORT Mormo - Brazil (02) (TO), equine, confirmed http://promedmail.org/post/20170823.5270939, is also suspected to have the disease.

It is rare in humans. It is unclear what symptoms occurred in the person and how the diagnosis was made. The following appears to be the most recent review of _B. mallei_ infections in humans including the description of disease manifestations: Van Zandt KE, Greer MT, Gelhaus HC. Glanders: an overview of infection in humans. Orphanet J Rare Dis. 2013 Sep 3;8:131. doi: 10.1186/1750-1172-8-131 (the full text and citations can be found at the original URL  ).<br><br><strong> \"Features of human clinical glanders </strong><br> \"General symptoms \"Many forms of glanders have been described, including chronic, disseminated, pulmonary, and septicemic. The variety of infections is largely explained by various routes of infection. Localized infections are generally regionally confined and typically characterized by foci of suppuration. The abscesses can ulcerate and drain for long periods of time. However, localized infections may disseminate, leading to pulmonary, septicemic, or multi-tissue infection 9. The most common clinical features of the eight laboratory-acquired infections from Fort Detrick included (in order of most common occurrence) afternoon to evening low-grade fever, malaise, fatigue, headache, myalgias including backache, lymphadenopathy, and chest pain. Approximately half of the patients not only felt better but were also clinically better for a period of time after the first wave of disease symptoms. This period lasted from a few days to 2 months then patients developed clinical signs of infection. \"Mucosal involvement \"Involvement of the eye and conjunctiva in a _B. mallei_ infection presents with excessive lacrimation and photophobia. Nasal involvement is characterized by inflammation and swelling of the nose, which is common following inhalation of _B. mallei_. This may be followed by copious nasal discharge. Additionally, infection may invade the nasal septum and bony tissues, causing fistulae and tissue destruction 9. The face may swell and regional lymph nodes may become inflamed. Infection may also extend lower in the respiratory tract, resulting in bronchitis which can be accompanied by cough and mucopurulent sputum production. Constitutional signs and symptoms such as fever and chills typically occur within the first few days following infection. Additionally, these symptoms may persist through treatment and be severe. Common signs and symptoms can include, but are not limited to, fever or low-grade fever in the afternoon to evening; chills with or without rigors; and severe headache 9. \"Cutaneous involvement \"Cutaneous manifestations include papular lesions that may erupt anywhere on the body with a more chronic, indolent course of infection. _B. mallei_ entry through an abrasion is typically followed by an inflammatory response, including pain and swelling. In these cases, a glanders node may appear as a single blister, gradually developing into an ulcer that may become hemorrhagic 18,35. A localized infection with a discharge typically develops at the entry site. Inflammation may extend along regional lymphatics and cause lymphangitis with numerous foci of suppuration along their course. The endotoxins present in _B. mallei_ strains affect the smooth muscle of the lymphatics 9 by enhancing the irritation and inflammation seen in the lymphatics. \"Pulmonary involvement \"A pulmonary infection typically results in pneumonia, pulmonary abscess, pleuritis, and plural effusion. Signs and symptoms of pulmonary infection can include cough, dyspnea, chest pain, and mucoplurent sputum. Nonspecific signs and symptoms such as fatigue, fever (often exceeding 102 deg F 38.9 deg C), chills, headache, myalgias, lymphangitis, sore throat, pleuritic chest pain, cough, tachypnea, dyspnea, discharge, and gastrointestinal signs often accompany respiratory infections 9. Many symptoms may take up to 2 to 3 weeks to develop. Nonspecific signs, such as dizziness, rigors, myalgia, nausea, night sweats, severe headache, tachycardia, weight loss, and mucosal eruptions are also usually present and may indicate a disseminated infection 9. \"Dissemination of infection \"Dissemination from local cutaneous or mucosal infection result in septicemia and the colonization of internal organs such as the spleen, liver, and lungs with the development of abscesses 9. Ultrasonography and computed tomography may reveal multiple, small discrete abscesses in both the liver and the kidney 23. These infections are typically associated with septic shock and high mortality.\" This publication describes what seems to have been the last of the cases of human _B. mallei_ in the USA: Srinivasan A, Kraus CN, DeShazer D, et al. Glanders in a military research microbiologist. N Engl J Med. 2001; 345: 256-8; (full text and citations can be found at the original URL \"Infection with _Burkholderia mallei_ (formerly _Pseudomonas mallei_) can cause a subcutaneous infection known as farcy or can disseminate to cause the condition known as glanders. In humans, acute infection with _B. mallei_ is characterized by necrosis of the tracheobronchial tree, pustular skin lesions, and either a febrile pneumonia, if the organism was inhaled, or signs of sepsis and multiple abscesses, if the skin was the portal of entry (1). At the turn of the 20th century, glanders was an important cause of death among horses, and there were secondary, often fatal, infections in humans (2). Because of the lethal and contagious nature of the disease, _B. mallei_ was considered an ideal agent for biologic warfare and was used for this purpose by Germany in World War I (3). \"Aggressive control measures essentially eliminated glanders from the West. However, with the resurgent concern about biologic warfare, _B. mallei_ is now being studied in laboratories worldwide. We describe here the first reported case of human glanders in the USA in more than 50 years and discuss some of the important events in the history of the disease and its initial eradication.<br><br><strong> \"Case report </strong><br> \"In March 2000, tender, left axillary adenopathy and fever (temperature, 38.6 deg C 101.5 deg F) developed in a 33 year old microbiologist at the US Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases who had type 1 diabetes mellitus. The patient had worked for 2 years investigating the basic microbiology of _B. mallei_ and did not routinely wear latex gloves. The adenopathy and fever persisted despite treatment for 10 days with a first-generation cephalosporin. An evaluation after this treatment, which included chest radiography as well as cultures of blood and urine, was unrevealing. During the next few weeks, the patient had increasing fatigue, night sweats, malaise, rigors, and weight loss. \"In early April 2000, his symptoms and adenopathy resolved during a 10-day course of clarithromycin, but he relapsed 4 days after the medication was stopped. On 2 May 2000, he was admitted to his local hospital with diabetic ketoacidosis. A computed tomographic (CT) scan showed multiple hepatic and splenic abscesses. \"On 4 May 2000, respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation developed, and the patient was transferred to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. Physical examination revealed a temperature of 40.3 deg C 104.5 deg F and a heart rate of 122 beats per minute. The patient had a grade 2/6 systolic murmur, coarse breath sounds, and moderate epigastric tenderness. Laboratory studies showed a white-cell count of 8300 per cubic millimeter, with 83 per cent neutrophils, 9 per cent monocytes, and 8 per cent lymphocytes. The hematocrit was 25.6 per cent. The concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were 53 U per liter and 56 U per liter, respectively, and the alkaline phosphatase was 197 IU per liter. Cultures of the patient's blood and a sample from a fine-needle aspiration biopsy of a liver abscess grew a small, bipolar, weakly staining, gram-negative rod that was identified by an automated bacterial-identification system as _Pseudomonas fluorescens_ or _P. putida_. However, gas-liquid chromatography of the cellular fatty acids (Microbial ID, Newark, Del.) placed the organism in the genus _Burkholderia_. Subsequent phenotypic testing and 16S ribosomal RNA gene-sequence analysis identified the organism as _B. mallei_. Initial susceptibility testing showed the isolate to be sensitive to imipenem, ceftazidime, and tetracycline. \"The patient was treated with imipenem and doxycycline, and there was rapid improvement. After two weeks, the imipenem was replaced by azithromycin, and the patient completed a six-month course of treatment with azithromycin and doxycycline. Although the organism was found retrospectively to be relatively resistant to azithromycin, a CT scan obtained after six months of treatment showed substantial improvement of the liver and spleen abscesses, and one year later the patient remained in good health.<br><br><strong> \"Discussion -</strong><br> This is the 1st reported human case of glanders in the English-language medical literature since 1949 (4) and it occurred in the context of research on agents of biologic warfare. \"Glanders may have been the first biologic weapon of the 20th century. During World War I, Germany had a program of biologic sabotage against several countries, including the United States, whereby cultures of _B. mallei_ and anthrax were distributed to undercover agents who attempted to infect livestock that were to be shipped to Allied countries (3). The intention was both the destruction of livestock and the transmission of the highly contagious, lethal agent from livestock to humans. It is currently suspected that attempts are being made to develop an aerosolized form of antibiotic-resistant _B. mallei_ that could become a biologic weapon as potent as anthrax. \"Glanders, an important human and veterinary disease, was eliminated without a vaccine or effective treatment. It appears to have been abolished by the veterinary use of a skin test to detect exposure to B. mallei combined with draconian agricultural measures to control infection (5). \"At the turn of the 20th century, Canada, Britain, and the USA all implemented glanders-control programs. By that time, the symptoms of equine glanders, which include fever and inflammation of the nasal mucosa with ultimate necrosis and obstruction of the oropharynx, had been well described (6). Laws were passed that required notification of the health department and the immediate slaughter of affected animals, with proper disposal of the carcasses. In addition, all horses on the premises where the infected horses were found had to be tested with the mallein skin test for exposure to _B. mallei_; any horses with a reaction also had to be slaughtered. Horses with no reaction were quarantined and then retested two to three weeks later. Furthermore, the equine contacts of the horses were traced to track down other horses that might have been exposed and then moved to other facilities. \"The case we describe illustrates the major clinical features of glanders, which can usually be traced to direct contact with _B. mallei_, as in workers exposed to animals with glanders (7) and in personnel who were exposed in laboratories during World War II (8). Although the patient discussed here could not recall a clear break in his skin or an accident in the laboratory, most reported occupational infections occur without recognized instances of exposure (9). As Robins commented in 1906, \"It is perhaps not advisable to be too dogmatic as to the invariable necessity of an abrasion being present in every case of human glanders . . . as in several such cases of our series it is distinctly stated that there was no abrasion.\" (7). As in our patient, _B. mallei_ often enters the body through the hand or arm. After an incubation period lasting between a few days and several weeks, local suppuration and regional lymphadenopathy occur. Constitutional symptoms often accompany the infection, with fever, rigors, and malaise predominating. If the infection is left untreated, abscesses in the lymph nodes will generally form, then break down and drain. \"Dissemination of the infection occurs 1 to 4 weeks after infection of the lymph nodes. Abscesses can be widespread, and _B. mallei_ can infect almost any tissue (7). Abscesses in the liver and the spleen, as were seen in our patient, appear to be relatively common, as does pulmonary involvement, including consolidation, abscesses, and pleural nodules. The acute onset and rapid resolution of the respiratory failure in our patient were more consistent with the respiratory distress syndrome associated with gram-negative bacteremia than with that associated with pulmonary glanders. Subcutaneous and intramuscular abscesses sometimes develop as well (7). \"There are few data regarding the antibiotic treatment of glanders, since the disease had largely disappeared by the time antibiotics became available. In vitro, ceftazidime, gentamicin, imipenem, doxycycline, and ciprofloxacin all have reliable activity against _B. mallei_ (10), and our patient's infection responded well to a combination of imipenem and doxycycline. Experimentally induced glanders also responds to a combination of sulfazine and trimethoprim (11). However, treatment of the disease in the setting of bioterrorism may be more difficult if the organism is drug-resistant. \"This case demonstrates the difficulties that microbiology laboratories may have in recognizing potential agents of biologic warfare. These microbes are rarely encountered and may be misidentified by conventional, phenotypic identification systems. Techniques such as cellular analysis of fatty acid and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing can be used to identify the organisms correctly, but these tests are not widely available. \"Finally, this case may serve as a harbinger of the resurgence of nearly forgotten diseases such as glanders, plague, smallpox, and anthrax. Research on these diseases is now being conducted in more laboratories, which increases the risk of occupational exposure. There is also the looming threat that some group will eventually mount a successful campaign of bioterrorism. Resources must be allocated both to prevent and to prepare for these frightening possibilities.

JAMA. 2017; 318(8): 689. doi:10.1001/jama.2017.<br><br><strong>11200 </strong><br> Researchers funded in part by the National Institutes of Health have recently demonstrated that 2 experimental vaccines can restrict transmission of Zika virus from pregnant mice to their fetuses, thereby shielding offspring from congenital damage or death. Multiple candidate Zika vaccines have been shown protective against infection with the virus in animal studies, with several now in human trials, but none were tested in the context of pregnancy, according to the authors of the study published in Cell  . The 2 vaccine candidates investigated in the new study are the 1st to demonstrate efficacy in preventing vertical transmission of the virus and related fetal death in an animal model. Although the vaccines were administered to female mice prior to pregnancy, the result is considered an important step toward developing a vaccine that could be safely given to pregnant women. One of the 2 candidates is a modified messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine encoding Zika genes, developed by the biotechnology company Moderna. It is already in safety trials in women who are not pregnant. The other is a live-attenuated Zika strain developed by researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). The testing was carried out by scientists from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Washington University School of Medicine, and UTMB. The researchers 1st vaccinated the mice with 1 of the vaccines or a placebo. After mating, the animals were challenged with the virus 6 days into pregnancy. A week later, more than 50 percent of placentas and fetuses from mice administered the mRNA vaccine had virtually no Zika RNA. The remainder had \"substantially lower\" levels relative to placebo. The live vaccine provided broader protection: 78 percent of placentas and 83 percent of fetuses had Zika RNA at or below the level of detection, while the placebo group exhibited significantly higher levels of placental and fetal Zika RNA. Mice vaccinated with either vaccine had significantly higher rates of fetal viability; whereas 100 percent of fetuses from mice vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine were born, none survived to term in the placebo group. A working group funded by the Wellcome Trust recently approved ethical guidelines for testing such vaccines in pregnant women, normally excluded from drug trials.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. It is reassuring to learn that at least 2 vaccines are now entering clinical trials in women.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea: \"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per cent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as \"potentially the most important medical advance\" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5). \"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.<br><br><strong> \"References </strong><br> 1.

Emerg Microbes Infect. 2017; 6(8): e69. doi: 10.1038/emi.2017.<br><br><strong>59  Abstract </strong><br> Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has recently been associated with an increased incidence of neonatal microcephaly and other neurological disorders. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito bite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some cases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main vector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other mosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the virus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit ZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of laboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. Interestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the midgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in Recife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially fed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx. quinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced. Collectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range of ZIKV vectors than anticipated.  <br><br>Communicated by: Roland Hübner Superior Health Council Brussels Belgium Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active virus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their ability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step toward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_ fed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in saliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing. The study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a competent vector. Several other studies have shown this species to be inefficient vectors or refractory to Zika virus infection. One wonders if the specific _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ used or the Zika virus isolates with which they were tested could account for these very different results. Resolving these discrepancies is important because this mosquito species is very widely distributed around the world and bears directly on risk of outbreaks in geographic areas where _Aedes aegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_ , Zika virus vectors, do not occur. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"92":{"title":"Invasive mosquito - Canada: (ON) ","date":["22","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH> Invasive mosquito - Canada: (ON) [EXTERNAL]","summary":"   Tue 22 Aug 2017, 11:28 AM ET Source: CBC News edited An adult _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, the species responsible for the majority of human Zika virus cases, has been found in Canada for the 1st time. Evidence shows mosquitoes capable of carrying Zika virus may have a colony in Ontario. Staff from the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit recently found the insect in a trap, a discovery health officials believe signals the species is becoming established in southern Ontario. \"It was just in such good shape, we are absolutely 100 per cent sure of what species it is,\" said Fiona Hunter, from Brock University, who heads up the lab that tested Windsor's mosquitoes. \"It didn't just blow in from the (United) States.\" Last week week ending 20 Aug 2017, the health unit revealed 2 _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes, also known as the Asian tiger mosquito, had also been found in the area. \"Once they establish themselves here it would be more difficult to control and maybe we'll see some diseases we haven't seen before,\" said Dr Wajid Ahmed, the region's acting medical officer of health, at the time. Having the Asian tiger mosquito show up in Canada was a bit of a surprise, considering it wasn't expected to migrate north for at least another decade, Hunter explained. But the odds of it arriving is still higher than the latest species. \"The Asian tiger mosquito is known to exist farther north in the (United) States ... but _Aedes aegypti_ is supposed to be sub-tropical and tropical - Mod.TY, so what on earth is it doing here?\" All aedes mosquitoes found in Windsor-Essex so far have tested negative for both the Zika and West Nile virus. Given there are no active cases of the diseases, there's less cause for alarm, according to Hunter. \"I think it's alarming  for the country  that our climate is changing,\" she said. \"In the last decade we've added another 10 mosquito species to our endemic list ... so we know something is going on.\"  communicated by: ProMED-mail Although finding _Aedes aegypti_ in southern Canada is a surprise, one should remember that this tropical and sub-tropical species became seasonally established along the east coast of the USA and was responsible for yellow fever outbreaks in northern cities such as Philadelphia more than 200 years ago. However, it will not become established in Canada for the same reason it has not become established in the north central and north east states of the USA. However, _Aedes albopictus_ distribution is another matter. This species has been extending its known range northward and recently has been found in Nebraska, Connecticut, Indiana, Ohio, Minnesota and Wisconsin, 3 of which border Ontario across the Great Lakes . Unlike _A. aegypti_, _A. albopictus_ eggs can go into diapause and withstand freezing winter temperatures. A University of Wisconsin-Madison entomologist Susan Paskewitz points out that viable populations of this species have not yet become established in these northern states and it seems unlikely that they will in Ontario either. However, continued surveillance for both is prudent. - Mod.TY   .

There are 10 infants hospitalized in the pediatrics service, while another 11 children have already been discharged; so now there are 14 beds available. In the neonatal ICU, 7 children are hospitalized; 2 of them are severely ill, and the capacity of the unit is 2 beds; while in the general ICU, 6 infants are hospitalized, and there are 2 beds available. \"With respect to bed availability, the hospital is still able to cope with the situation. However, a working overload for the personnel has been observed, so that extra personnel have been recruited to cover the work shifts,\" explained Dr. Joaquin Garcia-Gay, Medical Subdirector of the CRH. Also, Dr. Garcia-Gay explained that if a child develops a febrile illness, respiratory distress, intercostal retraction and malaise for 2 days, these are some of the symptoms that may indicate the presence of RSV, which mainly affects infants less than 2 years old. \"So, if such symptoms occur, then the child must be brought to the Urgency Service. However, for those patients that develop mild respiratory symptoms, such as common cold or other similar conditions, it is preferable they are not brought to the Urgency Service, since they may be at risk for becoming infected with RSV from patients that are being hospitalized,\" the specialist advised.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Most infants are infected before one year of age, and virtually everyone gets an RSV infection by 2 years of age. Each year, on average, in the United States, RSV leads to: - 57 527 hospitalizations among children younger than 5 years old - 2.1 million outpatient visits among children younger than 5 years old - 177 000 hospitalizations and 14 000 deaths among adults older than 65 years. In the United States and other areas with similar climates, RSV infections occur primarily during fall, winter, and spring  . It is currently winter in Chile. It is not clear what may have led to this current RSV outbreak in Chile. In 2001, an outbreak of RSV struck Santiago, Chile. 150 hospital admissions were registered daily during the height of the southern hemisphere winter. It was speculated that pollution may have played a role as Santiago is one of the world's most polluted cities. Chile's geography of surrounding mountains and heat inversions in winter dramatically increases the concentration of pollutants. Pollution leads to irritation of the respiratory tract making it more difficult for the immune system to respond to infections. (Excerpted from C Orellana.

No more reports will be submitted.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail The Chinese giant salamander (_Andrias davidianus_) is the largest amphibian in the world. It can grow to more than one meter (3.3 ft) in length. This species used to be widespread in central, south western, and southern China, but it is considered to be critically endangered. It has declined catastrophically over the last 30 years, principally due to over-exploitation, and it is now very rare, with few surviving populations known. Commercial over-exploitation for human consumption is the main threat to this species. It has also suffered from habitat destruction (such as from the construction of dams) and habitat degradation (such as water pollution from mines). For a picture go to  . In 2010, an outbreak of disease occurred amongst farmed Chinese giant salamanders in Shanxi Province, China. Clinical signs included anorexia, lethargy, ecchymosis, and swollen areas on the head and limbs and skin ulceration. An investigation was carried out and they isolated for the 1st time a ranavirus infection associated with mass mortality in Chinese giant salamanders. This virus was named Chinese giant salamander virus (CGSV-L). This virus has not been studied in the wild. It might be possible that it circulates causing little impact, but under the stressing circumstances that might arise in captivity the virulence increases. - Mod.PMB   .

DEFRA UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs has upgraded the threat to the UK from 'very low' to 'low'  meaning the risk is \"rare but could occur\" (EFSA European Food Safety Authority terminology). This severe disease of pigs entered Europe through Georgia in 2007, and has since continued to the Russian Federation and eastern Europe, including EU countries in the Baltic States, Poland and very recently the Czech Republic, in wild boar. In early August 2017, an outbreak was confirmed for the 1st time in Romania among backyard pigs. African swine fever is caused by infection with ASF virus (ASFV), which can have fatality rates of up to 100 per cent. The virus causes acute disease in domestic pigs and wild boar, and may cause varying clinical signs that are similar to other pig diseases such as high fever, lethargy and loss of appetite. Pigs may also die suddenly without clinical signs. Although the virus does not cause disease in humans, the impact it has on the economy, especially through trade and farming, is substantial. As a consequence of ASF in Poland and the Baltic States the value of pork and pig exports was reduced by USD 960 million (2014-2015). In Denmark, the predicted impact of an ASF outbreak is estimated at USD 12 million in direct losses and USD 349 million in exports. Unless the appropriate control measures are put in place, additional outbreaks could occur across Europe, further into Russia and beyond to Asia. An outbreak in the UK is unlikely as imports of meat and pigs are extremely well regulated and the UK does not have a wild boar population substantial enough or widespread enough to maintain an outbreak. However, personal imports of pork products from affected areas could result in disease incursion if deliberately or accidently fed to pigs or wild boar, actions which are illegal. The seriousness of an outbreak for some countries could be far worse than others; China is home to over half the world's pig population and an outbreak of ASF could result in devastating consequences. In a Veterinary Record article see reference below world-expert on ASF Dr Linda Dixon leader of the ASF group at The Pirbright Institute, outlines the factors that increase the likelihood of ASF spreading to China and highlights areas that could be improved to reduce the risk of an outbreak including biosecurity.  communicated by: ProMED-mail Subscribers may refer to more data in the article above, addressing the following questions: - how does ASF spread? - how quickly does it spread? - how can the spread of ASFV be prevented? - what is The Pirbright Institute doing to help? The last item includes the following statement: \"The vaccine research is crucial for the prevention and control of ASF, and good progress has so far been made. An effective vaccine will enable better control and prevention measures to be put in place in the future, helping stem the losses currently being suffered by farmers around the world.\" The editorial \"Preparing for the worst: African swine fever in China\", by Linda K Dixon, was recently published in the Veterinary Record  Vet Rec. 2017; 181: 115-6, doi: 10.1136/vr.j3525.  . - Mod.AS   .

The 1st 2 cases of cholera were tested positive by National Institute of Health Islamabad on Mon 31 Jul 2017 and another 2 confirmed positive for the infection on Fri 4 Aug 2017. All the 4 patients were undergoing treatment at Benazir Bhutto Hospital BH where as many as 4 more suspects of the infection have been admitted for treatment. Data collected by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017 reveals that the allied hospitals have sent stool samples of over 10 child patients to NIH for confirmation of cholera in last week week of Sun 6 Aug 2017. On Sat 12 Aug 2017, as many as 20 child patients with severe diarrhoea were admitted at the BBH of which 4 were suspected as patients of cholera and their stool samples were sent to NIH for confirmation, said Associate Professor of Paediatrics at Rawalpindi Medical University Dr Tariq Saeed when contacted by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017. He added the hospital has not received confirmation reports from the NIH because of holidays there from Saturday to Monday. However, we have been keeping the suspects in isolation under strict monitoring, he said. He added that repeated rainfalls in the region and water inundation inside and outside homes in a number of localities particularly in thickly populated areas of the city are causing contamination of water and foodstuff that increases chances of spread of a number of infections among population while children are at greater risk of contracting life-threatening infections including cholera. It is important that the transmission of cholera occurs primarily by drinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the feces (waste product) of an infected person, including one with no apparent symptoms. It is observed that heavy rainfall causes collection of heavily contaminated water in streets and houses and the waste water flooding out of various nullahs watercourses including Nullah Leh in town causes infections including cholera, typhoid, dysentery, gastroenteritis, hepatitis A and E, shigellosis and giardiasis. Professor Tariq said the consumption of contaminated water and foodstuff causes cholera, an infection in the small intestine caused by bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. Its main symptoms are watery diarrhea and vomiting that can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, and death in cases which are not treated in time, he said. Health experts say that to avoid cholera and other infections, one must use boiled water for drinking and should use vegetables after washing with clean water and it must be kept in mind that raw vegetables should not be eaten in the existing weather conditions instead these should be used after cooking. To a query, Professor Tariq said the heavy rainfall and water accumulation may contaminate water at sources and there may be chances of contamination of water at tube wells so individuals must boil water before drinking to avoid cholera and other infections. He added the appearance of cholera is alarming and it is time for people to take extra ordinary preventive measures to safeguard their children and themselves from the disease. In case water is accumulated inside home due to heavy rainfall and flooded out of sewage lines, it must be wiped out immediately and the space should be washed with clean water as soon as possible to avoid infections. Avoiding inundation of contaminated water inside homes is a must to avoid cholera and other infections, said Professor Tariq.

Its main symptoms are watery diarrhea and vomiting that can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, and death in cases which are not treated in time, he said. Health experts say that to avoid cholera and other infections, one must use boiled water for drinking and should use vegetables after washing with clean water and it must be kept in mind that raw vegetables should not be eaten in the existing weather conditions instead these should be used after cooking. To a query, Professor Tariq said the heavy rainfall and water accumulation may contaminate water at sources and there may be chances of contamination of water at tube wells so individuals must boil water before drinking to avoid cholera and other infections. He added the appearance of cholera is alarming and it is time for people to take extra ordinary preventive measures to safeguard their children and themselves from the disease. In case water is accumulated inside home due to heavy rainfall and flooded out of sewage lines, it must be wiped out immediately and the space should be washed with clean water as soon as possible to avoid infections. Avoiding inundation of contaminated water inside homes is a must to avoid cholera and other infections, said Professor Tariq.

Given the outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections in the region, and the clinical similarity of cases of that virus infection and CHIKV infection, one wonders how many cases that were not laboratory confirmed but clinically diagnosed as ZIKV infections were, in reality, CHIKV infections. It is also possible that a significant proportion of the population have been infected by CHIKV in the previous 3 years and are now immune. It seems likely, however, that CHIKV is now endemic in the Americas, and sporadic, small outbreaks may continue to occur as they do in Asia and Africa. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Cote dIvoire":{},"Croatia":{},"Cuba":{},"Curacao":{},"Cyprus":{},"Czech Republic":{"55":{"title":"African swine fever - Europe (18): Czech Republic (ZK)\r\n\twild boar, spread, control ","date":["18","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH/EDR> African swine fever - Europe (18): Czech Republic (ZK)\r\n\twild boar, spread, control [EXTERNAL]","summary":"   Fri 18 Aug 2017 Source: Web-site of the Czech State Veterinary Administration Czech, Mach transl, edited As of the above date, 159 dead feral pigs have been recorded by the State Veterinary Administration in the Zlín Region.

Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world. A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries. Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years. \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\" \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea\". The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years 2 million DALYs since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln 13 million DALYs in the US, and 36-mln 36 million DALYs in Ethiopia. \"Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,\" continues Prof Melegaro \"our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population. Tailoring immunization campaigns to achieve measles eradication goals is essential and currently, for some countries, this means considering also the role of unprotected adolescents and young adults.

Measles vaccination coverage is suboptimal in Italy (ranging between 85.4 percent and 90.6 percent for one dose during the period 2007-2016) 1, which has led to large pockets of susceptible adults. We describe an outbreak in an Italian hospital between February and April 2017 among healthcare workers (HCW), hospital support personnel (hospital workers in activities not involving direct contact with patients), hospital visitors and community contacts. This outbreak was part of a wider epidemic in Italy that started in January 2017 and has, as at Sun 30 Jul 2017, led to 4001 cases nationwide (275 in HCW) 2.<br><br><strong> Outbreak description </strong><br> A HCW was referred to the emergency department (ED) of an Italian hospital for a rash developed after taking antibacterials for a mild cough and coryza. The rash was considered an allergic reaction to the antibacterial and the HCW was admitted to the hospital inpatient clinic. Three days later, the HCW's child was admitted to hospital for a rash diagnosed as due to a non-communicable systemic disease. Subsequent serology showed that both the HCW and the child had measles. The origin of the infection for the index case is still unknown. It should be noted, however, that at least 10 community cases of measles occurred in the same period in the area of residence of the HCW. Using the standard case definition of the European Commission 3, a total of 34 measles cases during the following weeks were identified by tracing the contacts of the index case. Among them, 15 were HCWs, 5 were support personnel, 4 were hospital visitors and 11 were community contacts of the above cases. The secondary cases to the index (n = 8) occurred in 2 of the HCW's relatives, in 4 other HCWs, and in 2 support workers who were not immediately recognized as belonging to the hospital outbreak. One of the secondary cases, a HCW, was in service until the onset of symptoms, accessing all rooms on 2 inpatient wards. Tertiary cases (n = 6) involved the family of this HCW, 3 HCWs and a member of support personnel. A total of 2 weeks after the admission of the index case, 2 of the HCWs belonging to tertiary cases presented during the night to the ED where they stayed for nearly 10 hours. An additional 15 cases could be traced following this single exposure window, namely 7 HCWs, 2 support workers, 3 relatives of theirs and 3 visitors to the ED during the time the 2 HCWs were present. One more community case was related to contact outside hospital with one of the tertiary HCW cases. Additional cases were related to a visitor at one of the involved inpatient wards, who probably got in contact with one of the tertiary cases who were HCW during the incubation period and generated 3 cases in the community, among them a family pediatrician. Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the epidemic curve and the outbreak tree for figures, see original URL - Mod.LL.<br><br><strong> Characteristics of cases </strong><br> Up to 6 cases occurred in children up to 9 years of age, while 2 occurred in adolescents between 10 and 17 years and the majority of cases (n = 27) in adults 18 years and older. Figure 3 describes the age distribution among different categories of cases. Vaccination status was known for 24 cases. Sixteen were unvaccinated (2 children, 14 adults), 2 had received one dose, one a full course of 2 doses, and 5 cases occurred in contacts who received one dose of post-exposure vaccination. Of the 5 contacts who received post exposure vaccine, one was an infant younger than one year for whom information about the date of vaccination is not available; for the other 4, the delay between presumed contact date and immunization was 3 days in 2 cases, 6 and 12 days for the remaining 2 cases. Among the HCWs, 2 were vaccinated, 11 were unvaccinated and for 2 of them the data was unavailable. Among the 5 cases belonging to support personnel 2 were unvaccinated and the status was unknown for the remaining 3. Genotyping was available for 3 cases: genotype B3, subtype 3.1 was found in all of them.<br><br><strong> Conclusion and recommendations -</strong><br> Measles elimination in Europe, despite the immunization efforts, is still jeopardized by recurrent outbreaks in susceptible populations 4-7. Nosocomial transmission of measles is an important and emerging way of spreading the infection 8-11. Anyone staying in the hospital environment, regardless of role, can be affected because measles is highly contagious and persists in the environment for up to 2 hours, thus requiring appropriate and timely infection control measures 12,13. Considering that transmission may occur 3 days before the onset of rash, early diagnosis when only non-specific preliminary symptoms (cough, coryza and conjunctivitis) are present is crucial for containing the outbreak 14. A single exposure window, that occurred 2 weeks after the admission of the index case, when 2 cases were present in the ED, resulted in further 15 cases. Appropriate procedures are needed for patients with suspect transmissible infection in the ED, an issue not limited to measles but shared with several other highly infective conditions 13. A 2-dose vaccination is the most effective measure to prevent measles 15. This is of crucial importance for HCWs, with a view to their higher risk of exposure and of transmission to vulnerable patients. However, it should be noted that in at least 5 cases in this outbreak, measles occurred in personnel working in the hospital environment in support functions, highlighting the need to take into consideration the role of such personnel in the spread of the infection. Given that most of the support personnel belong to outsourced services, coordination is needed between occupational health unit and occupational health responsible of outsourced services.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail The full report can be found at the source URL. - Mod.ML There is no doubt that inadequate immunization levels are the major contributor to outbreaks of measles. Most of this is due to not receiving the 2 doses of vaccine due to personal or parenteral choice. Aggressive programs to reverse this unfortunate trend are needed to prevent outbreaks of this potentially lethal disease. The nosocomial setting as reflected in the 3rd post represents a special case situation. It is not clear why health care workers are not required to be immunized for measles. Additionally, when a case of measles is introduced into a health care facility, it has been my experience that the infection is not recognized promptly to minimize nosocomial spread. - Mod.LL   .

Given the outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections in the region, and the clinical similarity of cases of that virus infection and CHIKV infection, one wonders how many cases that were not laboratory confirmed but clinically diagnosed as ZIKV infections were, in reality, CHIKV infections. It is also possible that a significant proportion of the population have been infected by CHIKV in the previous 3 years and are now immune. It seems likely, however, that CHIKV is now endemic in the Americas, and sporadic, small outbreaks may continue to occur as they do in Asia and Africa. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"199":{"title":"Invasive mosquito - UK: (England) ","date":["23","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH> Invasive mosquito - UK: (England) [EXTERNAL]","summary":"   Wed 23 Aug 2017, 1:38 PM Source: Express edited Health specialists have blitzed a clutch of notorious Asian tiger mosquitoes suspected to have smuggled their way into Britain through the Eurotunnel. The invasive Asiatic mosquitoes can carry dengue fever and the chikungunya virus, and attack in daylight. Experts from Public Health England destroyed the batch of mosquito eggs and larvae at the busy Ashford International truck stop earlier this month August 2017. This is the 2nd time that one of the planet's most dangerous insects  so-named because of its striped body and legs  has been discovered entering into the UK during the last year. Asian tiger mosquitoes  scientific name, _Aedes albopictus_  have been spreading across Europe and are blamed for up to a million global cases of chikungunya globally every year. The disease has no cure and leaves victims in a fever and with excruciating joint pains as well as headaches, nausea and rashes. There is a death risk of one in a thousand cases. France confirmed 4 cases in 2014 and there was an epidemic in Italy a decade ago. Asian tiger mosquitoes are spreading the disease through the way their eggs and larvae have been exported from native forest haunts in south east Asia in tyre imports. The grubs eggs can survive for months and larvae and pupae develop in small pockets of water retained by tyres. To counter the threat, the authorities are maintaining a \"mosquito surveillance programme\" at 30 UK ports and airports as well as checks at motorway services on routes from south coast ports and Eurotunnel. Dr Jenny Harries, deputy medical director at Public Health England, said: \"Through these activities we identified a small number of eggs and larvae from the _Aedes albopictus_ mosquito in traps at Ashford International truck stop. A 2014 report of _Aedes aegypti_ in southern England was rejected. A statement by Jolyon Medlock, head of Medical Entomology & Zoonoses Ecology, Public Health England, Microbiological Research Authority (MRA), Emergency Response Department, Health Protection and Medical Directorate, Porton Down, Salisbury stated, \"This is misleading information as no invasive aedes mosquitoes have been found in the UK. There have been a number of news articles in British newspapers recently 2014 about invasive mosquitoes, reporting mainly on efforts to increase surveillance for _Aedes albopictus_, however no confirmed reports of any invasive aedes mosquito have been found during this surveillance, nor have any reports been submitted to the Medical Entomology group at Public Health England.\" (see Invasive mosquito - UK (02): (England) comment http://promedmail.org/post/20140923.2795988).

It is rare in humans. It is unclear what symptoms occurred in the person and how the diagnosis was made. The following appears to be the most recent review of _B. mallei_ infections in humans including the description of disease manifestations: Van Zandt KE, Greer MT, Gelhaus HC. Glanders: an overview of infection in humans. Orphanet J Rare Dis. 2013 Sep 3;8:131. doi: 10.1186/1750-1172-8-131 (the full text and citations can be found at the original URL  ).<br><br><strong> \"Features of human clinical glanders </strong><br> \"General symptoms \"Many forms of glanders have been described, including chronic, disseminated, pulmonary, and septicemic. The variety of infections is largely explained by various routes of infection. Localized infections are generally regionally confined and typically characterized by foci of suppuration. The abscesses can ulcerate and drain for long periods of time. However, localized infections may disseminate, leading to pulmonary, septicemic, or multi-tissue infection 9. The most common clinical features of the eight laboratory-acquired infections from Fort Detrick included (in order of most common occurrence) afternoon to evening low-grade fever, malaise, fatigue, headache, myalgias including backache, lymphadenopathy, and chest pain. Approximately half of the patients not only felt better but were also clinically better for a period of time after the first wave of disease symptoms. This period lasted from a few days to 2 months then patients developed clinical signs of infection. \"Mucosal involvement \"Involvement of the eye and conjunctiva in a _B. mallei_ infection presents with excessive lacrimation and photophobia. Nasal involvement is characterized by inflammation and swelling of the nose, which is common following inhalation of _B. mallei_. This may be followed by copious nasal discharge. Additionally, infection may invade the nasal septum and bony tissues, causing fistulae and tissue destruction 9. The face may swell and regional lymph nodes may become inflamed. Infection may also extend lower in the respiratory tract, resulting in bronchitis which can be accompanied by cough and mucopurulent sputum production. Constitutional signs and symptoms such as fever and chills typically occur within the first few days following infection. Additionally, these symptoms may persist through treatment and be severe. Common signs and symptoms can include, but are not limited to, fever or low-grade fever in the afternoon to evening; chills with or without rigors; and severe headache 9. \"Cutaneous involvement \"Cutaneous manifestations include papular lesions that may erupt anywhere on the body with a more chronic, indolent course of infection. _B. mallei_ entry through an abrasion is typically followed by an inflammatory response, including pain and swelling. In these cases, a glanders node may appear as a single blister, gradually developing into an ulcer that may become hemorrhagic 18,35. A localized infection with a discharge typically develops at the entry site. Inflammation may extend along regional lymphatics and cause lymphangitis with numerous foci of suppuration along their course. The endotoxins present in _B. mallei_ strains affect the smooth muscle of the lymphatics 9 by enhancing the irritation and inflammation seen in the lymphatics. \"Pulmonary involvement \"A pulmonary infection typically results in pneumonia, pulmonary abscess, pleuritis, and plural effusion. Signs and symptoms of pulmonary infection can include cough, dyspnea, chest pain, and mucoplurent sputum. Nonspecific signs and symptoms such as fatigue, fever (often exceeding 102 deg F 38.9 deg C), chills, headache, myalgias, lymphangitis, sore throat, pleuritic chest pain, cough, tachypnea, dyspnea, discharge, and gastrointestinal signs often accompany respiratory infections 9. Many symptoms may take up to 2 to 3 weeks to develop. Nonspecific signs, such as dizziness, rigors, myalgia, nausea, night sweats, severe headache, tachycardia, weight loss, and mucosal eruptions are also usually present and may indicate a disseminated infection 9. \"Dissemination of infection \"Dissemination from local cutaneous or mucosal infection result in septicemia and the colonization of internal organs such as the spleen, liver, and lungs with the development of abscesses 9. Ultrasonography and computed tomography may reveal multiple, small discrete abscesses in both the liver and the kidney 23. These infections are typically associated with septic shock and high mortality.\" This publication describes what seems to have been the last of the cases of human _B. mallei_ in the USA: Srinivasan A, Kraus CN, DeShazer D, et al. Glanders in a military research microbiologist. N Engl J Med. 2001; 345: 256-8; (full text and citations can be found at the original URL \"Infection with _Burkholderia mallei_ (formerly _Pseudomonas mallei_) can cause a subcutaneous infection known as farcy or can disseminate to cause the condition known as glanders. In humans, acute infection with _B. mallei_ is characterized by necrosis of the tracheobronchial tree, pustular skin lesions, and either a febrile pneumonia, if the organism was inhaled, or signs of sepsis and multiple abscesses, if the skin was the portal of entry (1). At the turn of the 20th century, glanders was an important cause of death among horses, and there were secondary, often fatal, infections in humans (2). Because of the lethal and contagious nature of the disease, _B. mallei_ was considered an ideal agent for biologic warfare and was used for this purpose by Germany in World War I (3). \"Aggressive control measures essentially eliminated glanders from the West. However, with the resurgent concern about biologic warfare, _B. mallei_ is now being studied in laboratories worldwide. We describe here the first reported case of human glanders in the USA in more than 50 years and discuss some of the important events in the history of the disease and its initial eradication.<br><br><strong> \"Case report </strong><br> \"In March 2000, tender, left axillary adenopathy and fever (temperature, 38.6 deg C 101.5 deg F) developed in a 33 year old microbiologist at the US Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases who had type 1 diabetes mellitus. The patient had worked for 2 years investigating the basic microbiology of _B. mallei_ and did not routinely wear latex gloves. The adenopathy and fever persisted despite treatment for 10 days with a first-generation cephalosporin. An evaluation after this treatment, which included chest radiography as well as cultures of blood and urine, was unrevealing. During the next few weeks, the patient had increasing fatigue, night sweats, malaise, rigors, and weight loss. \"In early April 2000, his symptoms and adenopathy resolved during a 10-day course of clarithromycin, but he relapsed 4 days after the medication was stopped. On 2 May 2000, he was admitted to his local hospital with diabetic ketoacidosis. A computed tomographic (CT) scan showed multiple hepatic and splenic abscesses. \"On 4 May 2000, respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation developed, and the patient was transferred to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. Physical examination revealed a temperature of 40.3 deg C 104.5 deg F and a heart rate of 122 beats per minute. The patient had a grade 2/6 systolic murmur, coarse breath sounds, and moderate epigastric tenderness. Laboratory studies showed a white-cell count of 8300 per cubic millimeter, with 83 per cent neutrophils, 9 per cent monocytes, and 8 per cent lymphocytes. The hematocrit was 25.6 per cent. The concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were 53 U per liter and 56 U per liter, respectively, and the alkaline phosphatase was 197 IU per liter. Cultures of the patient's blood and a sample from a fine-needle aspiration biopsy of a liver abscess grew a small, bipolar, weakly staining, gram-negative rod that was identified by an automated bacterial-identification system as _Pseudomonas fluorescens_ or _P. putida_. However, gas-liquid chromatography of the cellular fatty acids (Microbial ID, Newark, Del.) placed the organism in the genus _Burkholderia_. Subsequent phenotypic testing and 16S ribosomal RNA gene-sequence analysis identified the organism as _B. mallei_. Initial susceptibility testing showed the isolate to be sensitive to imipenem, ceftazidime, and tetracycline. \"The patient was treated with imipenem and doxycycline, and there was rapid improvement. After two weeks, the imipenem was replaced by azithromycin, and the patient completed a six-month course of treatment with azithromycin and doxycycline. Although the organism was found retrospectively to be relatively resistant to azithromycin, a CT scan obtained after six months of treatment showed substantial improvement of the liver and spleen abscesses, and one year later the patient remained in good health.<br><br><strong> \"Discussion -</strong><br> This is the 1st reported human case of glanders in the English-language medical literature since 1949 (4) and it occurred in the context of research on agents of biologic warfare. \"Glanders may have been the first biologic weapon of the 20th century. During World War I, Germany had a program of biologic sabotage against several countries, including the United States, whereby cultures of _B. mallei_ and anthrax were distributed to undercover agents who attempted to infect livestock that were to be shipped to Allied countries (3). The intention was both the destruction of livestock and the transmission of the highly contagious, lethal agent from livestock to humans. It is currently suspected that attempts are being made to develop an aerosolized form of antibiotic-resistant _B. mallei_ that could become a biologic weapon as potent as anthrax. \"Glanders, an important human and veterinary disease, was eliminated without a vaccine or effective treatment. It appears to have been abolished by the veterinary use of a skin test to detect exposure to B. mallei combined with draconian agricultural measures to control infection (5). \"At the turn of the 20th century, Canada, Britain, and the USA all implemented glanders-control programs. By that time, the symptoms of equine glanders, which include fever and inflammation of the nasal mucosa with ultimate necrosis and obstruction of the oropharynx, had been well described (6). Laws were passed that required notification of the health department and the immediate slaughter of affected animals, with proper disposal of the carcasses. In addition, all horses on the premises where the infected horses were found had to be tested with the mallein skin test for exposure to _B. mallei_; any horses with a reaction also had to be slaughtered. Horses with no reaction were quarantined and then retested two to three weeks later. Furthermore, the equine contacts of the horses were traced to track down other horses that might have been exposed and then moved to other facilities. \"The case we describe illustrates the major clinical features of glanders, which can usually be traced to direct contact with _B. mallei_, as in workers exposed to animals with glanders (7) and in personnel who were exposed in laboratories during World War II (8). Although the patient discussed here could not recall a clear break in his skin or an accident in the laboratory, most reported occupational infections occur without recognized instances of exposure (9). As Robins commented in 1906, \"It is perhaps not advisable to be too dogmatic as to the invariable necessity of an abrasion being present in every case of human glanders . . . as in several such cases of our series it is distinctly stated that there was no abrasion.\" (7). As in our patient, _B. mallei_ often enters the body through the hand or arm. After an incubation period lasting between a few days and several weeks, local suppuration and regional lymphadenopathy occur. Constitutional symptoms often accompany the infection, with fever, rigors, and malaise predominating. If the infection is left untreated, abscesses in the lymph nodes will generally form, then break down and drain. \"Dissemination of the infection occurs 1 to 4 weeks after infection of the lymph nodes. Abscesses can be widespread, and _B. mallei_ can infect almost any tissue (7). Abscesses in the liver and the spleen, as were seen in our patient, appear to be relatively common, as does pulmonary involvement, including consolidation, abscesses, and pleural nodules. The acute onset and rapid resolution of the respiratory failure in our patient were more consistent with the respiratory distress syndrome associated with gram-negative bacteremia than with that associated with pulmonary glanders. Subcutaneous and intramuscular abscesses sometimes develop as well (7). \"There are few data regarding the antibiotic treatment of glanders, since the disease had largely disappeared by the time antibiotics became available. In vitro, ceftazidime, gentamicin, imipenem, doxycycline, and ciprofloxacin all have reliable activity against _B. mallei_ (10), and our patient's infection responded well to a combination of imipenem and doxycycline. Experimentally induced glanders also responds to a combination of sulfazine and trimethoprim (11). However, treatment of the disease in the setting of bioterrorism may be more difficult if the organism is drug-resistant. \"This case demonstrates the difficulties that microbiology laboratories may have in recognizing potential agents of biologic warfare. These microbes are rarely encountered and may be misidentified by conventional, phenotypic identification systems. Techniques such as cellular analysis of fatty acid and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing can be used to identify the organisms correctly, but these tests are not widely available. \"Finally, this case may serve as a harbinger of the resurgence of nearly forgotten diseases such as glanders, plague, smallpox, and anthrax. Research on these diseases is now being conducted in more laboratories, which increases the risk of occupational exposure. There is also the looming threat that some group will eventually mount a successful campaign of bioterrorism. Resources must be allocated both to prevent and to prepare for these frightening possibilities.

Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world. A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries. Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years. \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\" \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea\". The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years 2 million DALYs since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln 13 million DALYs in the US, and 36-mln 36 million DALYs in Ethiopia. \"Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,\" continues Prof Melegaro \"our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population. Tailoring immunization campaigns to achieve measles eradication goals is essential and currently, for some countries, this means considering also the role of unprotected adolescents and young adults.

In April 6 Apr 2017 as well as in May 9 May 2017, one outbreak was detected each in birds kept in captivity. Thus, the HPAI epidemic seems to be waning in Germany. However, outbreaks or infections in wild birds are sporadically reported. The current avian flu epidemic is the most severe and longest-lasting epidemic that has occurred in Europe so far. In total, 29 European states have been or still are concerned. In addition to H5N8, 2 other HPAI subtypes have been detected in Europe, i.e. HPAI H5N5 (in 7 states) and H5N6 (in Greece). Outside Europe, avian influenza outbreaks of the subtype HPAI H5N8 have been reported from Russia, Israel, Egypt, Tunisia, Nigeria, Uganda, Cameroon, Iran, Nepal, and India. HPAI H5N1 is endemic in Asia and some African countries. Moreover, further HPAIV H5N1 related H5-strains are circulating in Asia. Although the current epidemic seems to be waning, isolated outbreaks may still occur. The recent reports of HPAIV cases in birds kept in captivity, which occurred in May 2017, indicate that, at least in some countries, infectious virus is still circulating in the environment. Therefore, biosecurity measures should be maintained. These include, inter alia, wearing of stable specific protective clothing and footwear, cleaning and disinfection of equipment that has been in contact with birds, and the best possible prevention of contacts between poultry and wild birds.

The 1st 2 cases of cholera were tested positive by National Institute of Health Islamabad on Mon 31 Jul 2017 and another 2 confirmed positive for the infection on Fri 4 Aug 2017. All the 4 patients were undergoing treatment at Benazir Bhutto Hospital BH where as many as 4 more suspects of the infection have been admitted for treatment. Data collected by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017 reveals that the allied hospitals have sent stool samples of over 10 child patients to NIH for confirmation of cholera in last week week of Sun 6 Aug 2017. On Sat 12 Aug 2017, as many as 20 child patients with severe diarrhoea were admitted at the BBH of which 4 were suspected as patients of cholera and their stool samples were sent to NIH for confirmation, said Associate Professor of Paediatrics at Rawalpindi Medical University Dr Tariq Saeed when contacted by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017. He added the hospital has not received confirmation reports from the NIH because of holidays there from Saturday to Monday. However, we have been keeping the suspects in isolation under strict monitoring, he said. He added that repeated rainfalls in the region and water inundation inside and outside homes in a number of localities particularly in thickly populated areas of the city are causing contamination of water and foodstuff that increases chances of spread of a number of infections among population while children are at greater risk of contracting life-threatening infections including cholera. It is important that the transmission of cholera occurs primarily by drinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the feces (waste product) of an infected person, including one with no apparent symptoms. It is observed that heavy rainfall causes collection of heavily contaminated water in streets and houses and the waste water flooding out of various nullahs watercourses including Nullah Leh in town causes infections including cholera, typhoid, dysentery, gastroenteritis, hepatitis A and E, shigellosis and giardiasis. Professor Tariq said the consumption of contaminated water and foodstuff causes cholera, an infection in the small intestine caused by bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. Its main symptoms are watery diarrhea and vomiting that can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, and death in cases which are not treated in time, he said. Health experts say that to avoid cholera and other infections, one must use boiled water for drinking and should use vegetables after washing with clean water and it must be kept in mind that raw vegetables should not be eaten in the existing weather conditions instead these should be used after cooking. To a query, Professor Tariq said the heavy rainfall and water accumulation may contaminate water at sources and there may be chances of contamination of water at tube wells so individuals must boil water before drinking to avoid cholera and other infections. He added the appearance of cholera is alarming and it is time for people to take extra ordinary preventive measures to safeguard their children and themselves from the disease. In case water is accumulated inside home due to heavy rainfall and flooded out of sewage lines, it must be wiped out immediately and the space should be washed with clean water as soon as possible to avoid infections. Avoiding inundation of contaminated water inside homes is a must to avoid cholera and other infections, said Professor Tariq.

The 1st 2 cases of cholera were tested positive by National Institute of Health Islamabad on Mon 31 Jul 2017 and another 2 confirmed positive for the infection on Fri 4 Aug 2017. All the 4 patients were undergoing treatment at Benazir Bhutto Hospital BH where as many as 4 more suspects of the infection have been admitted for treatment. Data collected by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017 reveals that the allied hospitals have sent stool samples of over 10 child patients to NIH for confirmation of cholera in last week week of Sun 6 Aug 2017. On Sat 12 Aug 2017, as many as 20 child patients with severe diarrhoea were admitted at the BBH of which 4 were suspected as patients of cholera and their stool samples were sent to NIH for confirmation, said Associate Professor of Paediatrics at Rawalpindi Medical University Dr Tariq Saeed when contacted by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017. He added the hospital has not received confirmation reports from the NIH because of holidays there from Saturday to Monday. However, we have been keeping the suspects in isolation under strict monitoring, he said. He added that repeated rainfalls in the region and water inundation inside and outside homes in a number of localities particularly in thickly populated areas of the city are causing contamination of water and foodstuff that increases chances of spread of a number of infections among population while children are at greater risk of contracting life-threatening infections including cholera. It is important that the transmission of cholera occurs primarily by drinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the feces (waste product) of an infected person, including one with no apparent symptoms. It is observed that heavy rainfall causes collection of heavily contaminated water in streets and houses and the waste water flooding out of various nullahs watercourses including Nullah Leh in town causes infections including cholera, typhoid, dysentery, gastroenteritis, hepatitis A and E, shigellosis and giardiasis. Professor Tariq said the consumption of contaminated water and foodstuff causes cholera, an infection in the small intestine caused by bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. Its main symptoms are watery diarrhea and vomiting that can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, and death in cases which are not treated in time, he said. Health experts say that to avoid cholera and other infections, one must use boiled water for drinking and should use vegetables after washing with clean water and it must be kept in mind that raw vegetables should not be eaten in the existing weather conditions instead these should be used after cooking. To a query, Professor Tariq said the heavy rainfall and water accumulation may contaminate water at sources and there may be chances of contamination of water at tube wells so individuals must boil water before drinking to avoid cholera and other infections. He added the appearance of cholera is alarming and it is time for people to take extra ordinary preventive measures to safeguard their children and themselves from the disease. In case water is accumulated inside home due to heavy rainfall and flooded out of sewage lines, it must be wiped out immediately and the space should be washed with clean water as soon as possible to avoid infections. Avoiding inundation of contaminated water inside homes is a must to avoid cholera and other infections, said Professor Tariq.

No more reports will be submitted.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail The Chinese giant salamander (_Andrias davidianus_) is the largest amphibian in the world. It can grow to more than one meter (3.3 ft) in length. This species used to be widespread in central, south western, and southern China, but it is considered to be critically endangered. It has declined catastrophically over the last 30 years, principally due to over-exploitation, and it is now very rare, with few surviving populations known. Commercial over-exploitation for human consumption is the main threat to this species. It has also suffered from habitat destruction (such as from the construction of dams) and habitat degradation (such as water pollution from mines). For a picture go to  . In 2010, an outbreak of disease occurred amongst farmed Chinese giant salamanders in Shanxi Province, China. Clinical signs included anorexia, lethargy, ecchymosis, and swollen areas on the head and limbs and skin ulceration. An investigation was carried out and they isolated for the 1st time a ranavirus infection associated with mass mortality in Chinese giant salamanders. This virus was named Chinese giant salamander virus (CGSV-L). This virus has not been studied in the wild. It might be possible that it circulates causing little impact, but under the stressing circumstances that might arise in captivity the virulence increases. - Mod.PMB   .

Emerg Microbes Infect. 2017; 6(8): e69. doi: 10.1038/emi.2017.<br><br><strong>59  Abstract </strong><br> Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has recently been associated with an increased incidence of neonatal microcephaly and other neurological disorders. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito bite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some cases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main vector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other mosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the virus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit ZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of laboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. Interestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the midgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in Recife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially fed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx. quinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced. Collectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range of ZIKV vectors than anticipated.  <br><br>Communicated by: Roland Hübner Superior Health Council Brussels Belgium Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active virus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their ability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step toward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_ fed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in saliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing. The study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a competent vector. Several other studies have shown this species to be inefficient vectors or refractory to Zika virus infection. One wonders if the specific _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ used or the Zika virus isolates with which they were tested could account for these very different results. Resolving these discrepancies is important because this mosquito species is very widely distributed around the world and bears directly on risk of outbreaks in geographic areas where _Aedes aegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_ , Zika virus vectors, do not occur. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"66":{"title":"Chlorine gas - India: (UT) waterworks, RFI ","date":["18","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Chlorine gas - India: (UT) waterworks, RFI [EXTERNAL]","summary":"   Fri 18 Aug 2017 Source: India Times edited In the early hours of Fri 18 Aug 2017, 17 people, including 5 children, were taken ill after chlorine gas leakage from a cylinder at a waterworks unit of Uttarakhand Jal Sansthan in Dehradun. Police rushed to the spot immediately and threw the leaking cylinder into the water to neutralise it, SP (City) Pradeep Kumar Rai, told PTI. People living in the waterworks area including children, mostly sleeping at that hour, were rushed to different hospitals in the city after they complained of difficulty in breathing and some of them especially children even fainted, the SP (city) said. Altogether 17 people were hospitalized: 8 were admitted in Mahanth Indresh hospital, 5 in Max Hospital, and 4 in CMI hospital, the SP said. However, all of them are out of danger with a majority already discharged from hospitals, he said. The Managing Director of Jan Sansthan said an inquiry is being conducted into the gas leak at the waterworks. Where the homes near there? Perhaps above the waterworks unit? How big was the cylinder to cause this kind of problem? These are likely rhetorical questions but answers would provide insight into what really happened. Chlorine gas is a pulmonary irritant with intermediate water solubility that causes acute damage in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Exposure to low concentrations of chlorine for prolonged periods may have destructive effects, as might very short-term exposure to high concentrations. Long-term complications may occur after breathing in high concentrations of chlorine. Complications are more likely to be seen in people who develop severe health problems such as fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema) following the initial exposure. How chlorine works - The extent of poisoning caused by chlorine depends on the amount of chlorine a person is exposed to, how the person was exposed, and the length of time of the exposure. - When chlorine gas comes into contact with moist tissues such as the eyes, throat, and lungs, an acid is produced that can damage these tissues. Immediate signs and symptoms of chlorine exposure During or immediately after exposure to dangerous concentrations of chlorine, the following signs and symptoms may develop: - blurred vision; - burning pain, redness, and blisters on the skin if exposed to gas. Skin injuries similar to frostbite can occur if it is exposed to liquid chlorine; - burning sensation in the nose, throat, and eyes; - coughing; - chest tightness; - difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. These may appear immediately if high concentrations of chlorine gas are inhaled, or they may be delayed if low concentrations of chlorine gas are inhaled; - fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema) that may be delayed for a few hours; - nausea and vomiting; - watery eyes; - wheezing Long-term health effects Long-term complications may occur after breathing in high concentrations of chlorine.

While swine flu and dengue are spreading in the urban areas, the tribal hinterland has been beset with outbreaks of encephalitis since 2012. Though no Japanese encephalitis (JE) mortalities have been registered as yet in the official records, 473 acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) cases have been diagnosed so far. Odisha stands 5th in AES mortality after Uttar Pradesh, Assam, West Bengal and Bihar. According to the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, AES had taken 13 lives by the 1st week of August 2017. Apart from AES, 8 persons have fallen victim to swine flu in Odisha in the last 2 weeks. More than 100 positive cases have been detected. Dengue is the other scourge in the state with 2 deaths and 367 positive cases. Both AES and JE have been regular in Odisha since 2012. Last year, the state grabbed the national headlines when 115 children died of AES and 42 fell to JE. Most of the deaths were reported from Malkangiri district. But the state government has been equivocating on the incidence of AES. It went to the extent of claiming that consumption of seeds of a plant called _Cassia occidentalis_, locally known as Bada Chakunda, caused death of a 3rd of the children who fell to encephalitis in Malkangiri district. An expert committee suggested that JE could not be blamed for all the deaths because \"encephalopathy\" was the culprit. Encephalopathy, it said, is a non-infectious biochemical syndrome that can be aggravated by the consumption of _Cassia_ seeds. The fact is the Naveen Patnaik government remained aloof to the spread of AES, which is caused by a vector-borne virus hosted by pigs. The Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC), Bhubaneswar, carried out a study on the outbreak of AES in Malkangiri in 2015 but its findings were not paid heed to. From 38 deaths in 2012 to 115 in 2016, the AES surge was waiting to happen.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail As of the end of May 2017, there were 313 cases of AES with 10 deaths in Odisha and now the case count is 473 with 13 deaths in the 1st week of August 2017. Odisha state is endemic for Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus, and cases occur there frequently. As with cases of encephalitis mentioned above and in other states in northeastern India, not all encephalitis cases are due to JE virus and are classified as acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) with undetermined etiology. As noted in previous ProMED-mail comments, AES is a term used for multiple etiologies or often when no etiology has been determined. The encephalitis picture in northeastern India is complicated. Although JE virus etiology of some previously reported encephalitis cases has been confirmed by laboratory tests, many cases go undiagnosed, or JE virus infection is ruled out, and other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus (_O. tsutsugamushi_) and lychee fruit consumption, have been proposed. However, in November 2016 the Odisha state government formed the 6-member panel, led by eminent virologist Dr Jacob John from Vellore's Christian Medical College. In the interim report, Dr John said that anthraquinone, a toxin found in the plant _Cassia occidentalis_, was found in the urine sample of 5 deceased children. \"This indicates that the children (had) consumed the seeds of the plant,\" he said. Getting to an accurate diagnosis in these cases of AES will require active field surveillance with epidemiological studies supported by timely laboratory testing. - Mod.TY _Cassia occidentalis_, also called _Senna occidentalis_, produces seeds, in long seed pods that are sometimes roasted and made into a coffee-like beverage, Its roots, leaves, flowers, and seeds have been used medicinally as, for example, a laxative (attributed to the actions of anthraquinones found in the plant), an antipyretic, a tonic , and a diuretic ( ). - Mod.ML ","keywordsMatched":[]},"91":{"title":"Chikungunya (27) - Americas, Europe, Asia ","date":["18","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Chikungunya (27) - Americas, Europe, Asia [EXTERNAL]","summary":"<br><br><strong> Cases in various countries: Regional summaries - Americas -</strong><br> WHO/PAHO report 18 Aug 2017 Reported cases of chikungunya fever in the Americas, by country or territory - 2017 to EW 33 week ending 18 Aug 2017.

Given the outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections in the region, and the clinical similarity of cases of that virus infection and CHIKV infection, one wonders how many cases that were not laboratory confirmed but clinically diagnosed as ZIKV infections were, in reality, CHIKV infections. It is also possible that a significant proportion of the population have been infected by CHIKV in the previous 3 years and are now immune. It seems likely, however, that CHIKV is now endemic in the Americas, and sporadic, small outbreaks may continue to occur as they do in Asia and Africa. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"94":{"title":"Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (88): Africa,\r\n\tAsia ","date":["22","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (88): Africa,\r\n\tAsia [EXTERNAL]","summary":" 6 Diarrhea - Nepal (Kapilvastu district)  Sun 20 Aug 2017 Source: The Himalayan Times edited A child has reportedly succumbed to diarrhea in Sattbhara, of Maharajgunj Municipality-7 in Kapilvastu district Province Five on Sun 20 Aug 2017.

NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are: - Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_; - Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam; - Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas.

This product, a single dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products which are given in 2 doses.

Epidemiologically, usually spread by contaminated food or water, typhoid is not a zoonosis like the commoner types of salmonellosis. Clinically, vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent; indeed, constipation is frequently reported. As it is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive. The symptoms of classical typhoid fever typically include fever, anorexia, lethargy, malaise, dull continuous headache, non-productive cough, vague abdominal pain, and constipation. Despite the often high fever, the pulse is often only slightly elevated. During the 2nd week of the illness, there is protracted fever and mental dullness, classically called coma vigil. Diarrhea may develop but usually does not. Many patients develop hepatosplenomegaly both liver and spleen enlarged. After the 1st week or so, many cases develop a maculopapular rash on the upper abdomen. These lesions (\"rose spots\") are about 2 cm 0.78 in in diameter and blanch on pressure. They persist for 2-4 days and may come and go. Mild and atypical infections are common. The word typhoid (as in typhus-like) reflects the similarity of the louseborne rickettsial disease epidemic typhus and that of typhoid fever; in fact, in some areas, typhoid fever is still referred to as abdominal typhus.

For the said and additional information on Nepal's FMD past records, including genotyping results (though not yet of the newly introduced A/ASIA/G-VII lineage), see  . The identification of the A/ASIA/G-VII lineage in Nepal represents further spread of this virus, which had been evolving in India many years back (\"A/IND/40/2000\", genotyped A/ASIA/G-VII, was collected in 1999). In 2010, this strain was detected in Myanmar. In 2015, it appeared for the 1st time in the Middle East (\"FMD Pool 3\"), being detected in Saudi Arabia followed, during the same year, by Iran, Turkey and Armenia. Most recently (May 2017), this virus was identified in Northern Israel, on the Lebanese and Syrian borders. According to the information included in the Guest Editor's comments to EuFMD's (European Commission for the control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease) monthly report \"Global Foot-and-Mouth Disease Situation\", June 2017, there were reports of poor performance of vaccine strains derived from the A/ASIA/Iran-05 strain against the A/ASIA/G-VII lineage.

We have been taking blood samples of horses repeatedly in the district. Last month July 2017, 2 horses were diagnosed with Glanders in Najibabad area. Both horses had to be killed by a team of veterinary doctors...\" The veterinary officer explained since there is no known treatment or vaccine for Glanders, an animal that tests positive is put to sleep to prevent the disease from spreading. It is a fatal disease. Government compensates the equine owner after killing a sick animal. The compensation for horses and mules range from Rs 16 000 to Rs 25 000 USD 250.00 to 390.00 he added. byline: Harveer Dabas  communicated by: ProMED-mail India and Brazil are known to lead the list of countries where glanders, a zoonotic, OIE-listed equids disease, is endemic. Media reports on cases of the traditionally fearsome glanders, are often published by the Indian press. This is not fully reflected in India's official reports to the OIE. According to the recent ones, the annual numbers of recorded glanders outbreaks (in equidae) countrywide were as follows: 2010 - 1; 2011 - 3; 2012 - 1; 2013 - 1; 2014 - 0; 2015 - 5. During the 1st semester of 2016, 9 outbreaks were reported, involving 45 cases of which 36 died. India's OIE semi-annual report for the period Jul-Dec 2016 is not yet available. No statistics on the incidence of glanders in humans in India could be obtained. Glanders is a contagious and fatal disease of horses, donkeys, and mules, caused by infection with the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_. The pathogen causes nodules and ulcerations in the upper respiratory tract and lungs. A skin form also occurs, known as 'farcy'. Control of glanders requires testing of suspect clinical cases, screening of apparently normal equids, and elimination of reactors. _B. mallei_ can be transmitted to humans, but such cases, which were known to be often fatal, have become rather uncommon (see ref 1). In view of its zoonotic potential, all infected or contaminated (or potentially infected or contaminated) material must be handled in a laboratory with appropriate biosafety and biosecurity controls following a biorisk analysis. The above and additional information on glanders, its causative agent and its diagnosis is available at  . A useful updated review on the disease, including its recent global distribution, is available in ref 1. No vaccine against this disease is available.

Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world. A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries. Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years. \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\" \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea\". The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years 2 million DALYs since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln 13 million DALYs in the US, and 36-mln 36 million DALYs in Ethiopia. \"Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,\" continues Prof Melegaro \"our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population. Tailoring immunization campaigns to achieve measles eradication goals is essential and currently, for some countries, this means considering also the role of unprotected adolescents and young adults.

Regarding his questions/comments: 1. As I noted in the moderation of the original post, there is a lesser discussed \"window period\" occurring in the incubation period of acute hepatitis B prior to the development of HBsAg and before the development of anti-HBc (IgM and then IgG). The more classical \"window period\" occurs towards the end of acute hepatitis B, whether clinically overt or not, when HBsAg is not longer detectable by standard assays but before anti-HBs is detectable. The only serologic evidence of HBV is anti-HBc and IgM anti-HBc should be positive. HBV DNA is also detectable. It has been shown that blood transfused during this period can be infectious for HBV. 2-4. All good questions which I cannot supply answers to. 5. Most patients who are not immunosuppressed will clear HBV within 3-6 months. 10 percent will not although half of these are usually clear within a year.

The disease detection was associated with an import of koi from Israel by a wholesaler who distributed fish to greenhouses, pet stores and garden centres within BC for sale to private individuals. As a result of this detection, the import of all susceptible species of aquatic animals from Israel for the following end uses will be suspended until further notice: - aquarium - commercial; - aquarium - private; - outdoor holding unit - commercial; and - outdoor holding unit - private. The CFIA is committed to working with Israel to ensure that Canada's aquatic animal health import requirements are met and the suspended zoosanitary export certificate, which applies to all exports from Israel for the aforementioned end uses, can be renegotiated as quickly as possible in order to minimize any impact on trade.

Measles vaccination coverage is suboptimal in Italy (ranging between 85.4 percent and 90.6 percent for one dose during the period 2007-2016) 1, which has led to large pockets of susceptible adults. We describe an outbreak in an Italian hospital between February and April 2017 among healthcare workers (HCW), hospital support personnel (hospital workers in activities not involving direct contact with patients), hospital visitors and community contacts. This outbreak was part of a wider epidemic in Italy that started in January 2017 and has, as at Sun 30 Jul 2017, led to 4001 cases nationwide (275 in HCW) 2.<br><br><strong> Outbreak description </strong><br> A HCW was referred to the emergency department (ED) of an Italian hospital for a rash developed after taking antibacterials for a mild cough and coryza. The rash was considered an allergic reaction to the antibacterial and the HCW was admitted to the hospital inpatient clinic. Three days later, the HCW's child was admitted to hospital for a rash diagnosed as due to a non-communicable systemic disease. Subsequent serology showed that both the HCW and the child had measles. The origin of the infection for the index case is still unknown. It should be noted, however, that at least 10 community cases of measles occurred in the same period in the area of residence of the HCW. Using the standard case definition of the European Commission 3, a total of 34 measles cases during the following weeks were identified by tracing the contacts of the index case. Among them, 15 were HCWs, 5 were support personnel, 4 were hospital visitors and 11 were community contacts of the above cases. The secondary cases to the index (n = 8) occurred in 2 of the HCW's relatives, in 4 other HCWs, and in 2 support workers who were not immediately recognized as belonging to the hospital outbreak. One of the secondary cases, a HCW, was in service until the onset of symptoms, accessing all rooms on 2 inpatient wards. Tertiary cases (n = 6) involved the family of this HCW, 3 HCWs and a member of support personnel. A total of 2 weeks after the admission of the index case, 2 of the HCWs belonging to tertiary cases presented during the night to the ED where they stayed for nearly 10 hours. An additional 15 cases could be traced following this single exposure window, namely 7 HCWs, 2 support workers, 3 relatives of theirs and 3 visitors to the ED during the time the 2 HCWs were present. One more community case was related to contact outside hospital with one of the tertiary HCW cases. Additional cases were related to a visitor at one of the involved inpatient wards, who probably got in contact with one of the tertiary cases who were HCW during the incubation period and generated 3 cases in the community, among them a family pediatrician. Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the epidemic curve and the outbreak tree for figures, see original URL - Mod.LL.<br><br><strong> Characteristics of cases </strong><br> Up to 6 cases occurred in children up to 9 years of age, while 2 occurred in adolescents between 10 and 17 years and the majority of cases (n = 27) in adults 18 years and older. Figure 3 describes the age distribution among different categories of cases. Vaccination status was known for 24 cases. Sixteen were unvaccinated (2 children, 14 adults), 2 had received one dose, one a full course of 2 doses, and 5 cases occurred in contacts who received one dose of post-exposure vaccination. Of the 5 contacts who received post exposure vaccine, one was an infant younger than one year for whom information about the date of vaccination is not available; for the other 4, the delay between presumed contact date and immunization was 3 days in 2 cases, 6 and 12 days for the remaining 2 cases. Among the HCWs, 2 were vaccinated, 11 were unvaccinated and for 2 of them the data was unavailable. Among the 5 cases belonging to support personnel 2 were unvaccinated and the status was unknown for the remaining 3. Genotyping was available for 3 cases: genotype B3, subtype 3.1 was found in all of them.<br><br><strong> Conclusion and recommendations -</strong><br> Measles elimination in Europe, despite the immunization efforts, is still jeopardized by recurrent outbreaks in susceptible populations 4-7. Nosocomial transmission of measles is an important and emerging way of spreading the infection 8-11. Anyone staying in the hospital environment, regardless of role, can be affected because measles is highly contagious and persists in the environment for up to 2 hours, thus requiring appropriate and timely infection control measures 12,13. Considering that transmission may occur 3 days before the onset of rash, early diagnosis when only non-specific preliminary symptoms (cough, coryza and conjunctivitis) are present is crucial for containing the outbreak 14. A single exposure window, that occurred 2 weeks after the admission of the index case, when 2 cases were present in the ED, resulted in further 15 cases. Appropriate procedures are needed for patients with suspect transmissible infection in the ED, an issue not limited to measles but shared with several other highly infective conditions 13. A 2-dose vaccination is the most effective measure to prevent measles 15. This is of crucial importance for HCWs, with a view to their higher risk of exposure and of transmission to vulnerable patients. However, it should be noted that in at least 5 cases in this outbreak, measles occurred in personnel working in the hospital environment in support functions, highlighting the need to take into consideration the role of such personnel in the spread of the infection. Given that most of the support personnel belong to outsourced services, coordination is needed between occupational health unit and occupational health responsible of outsourced services.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail The full report can be found at the source URL. - Mod.ML There is no doubt that inadequate immunization levels are the major contributor to outbreaks of measles. Most of this is due to not receiving the 2 doses of vaccine due to personal or parenteral choice. Aggressive programs to reverse this unfortunate trend are needed to prevent outbreaks of this potentially lethal disease. The nosocomial setting as reflected in the 3rd post represents a special case situation. It is not clear why health care workers are not required to be immunized for measles. Additionally, when a case of measles is introduced into a health care facility, it has been my experience that the infection is not recognized promptly to minimize nosocomial spread. - Mod.LL   .

To counter the threat, the authorities are maintaining a \"mosquito surveillance programme\" at 30 UK ports and airports as well as checks at motorway services on routes from south coast ports and Eurotunnel. Dr Jenny Harries, deputy medical director at Public Health England, said: \"Through these activities we identified a small number of eggs and larvae from the _Aedes albopictus_ mosquito in traps at Ashford International truck stop. A 2014 report of _Aedes aegypti_ in southern England was rejected. A statement by Jolyon Medlock, head of Medical Entomology & Zoonoses Ecology, Public Health England, Microbiological Research Authority (MRA), Emergency Response Department, Health Protection and Medical Directorate, Porton Down, Salisbury stated, \"This is misleading information as no invasive aedes mosquitoes have been found in the UK. There have been a number of news articles in British newspapers recently 2014 about invasive mosquitoes, reporting mainly on efforts to increase surveillance for _Aedes albopictus_, however no confirmed reports of any invasive aedes mosquito have been found during this surveillance, nor have any reports been submitted to the Medical Entomology group at Public Health England.\" (see Invasive mosquito - UK (02): (England) comment http://promedmail.org/post/20140923.2795988).

Public Health Gibraltar and the Environmental Agency confirmed that the mosquito of the species _Aedes albopictus_, also known as the tiger mosquito, has been found in Gibraltar. Last June 2017 after 9 months of intensive surveillance, officials said no tiger mosquito had been found in Gibraltar. But this has now changed after the 1st tiger mosquito was found in the urban domestic environment within Gibraltar. \"This finding alone does not however materially alter any health risks in Gibraltar and there is no immediate cause for public concern,\" the government said in a statement. Public Health Gibraltar was first alerted in January 2016 to the discovery of the mosquito in Málaga and Algeciras in Andalusia, Spain. Since then, together with the Environmental Agency, it began working with international experts to mount surveillance in Gibraltar. World Health Organization experts visited Gibraltar and gave advice on setting traps and monitoring locations, but no tiger mosquito had been detected until now. The tiger mosquito is not native to Gibraltar and has not been previously found here. It is common in other countries where it transmits viral diseases like Zika, dengue, and chikungunya. It is a domestic species, breeds in water in urban areas  water butts, blocked drains, rainwater gullies  and is able to reach high abundance around residential areas. It is also a day-time mosquito, that aggressively bites humans. \"Health risks to the public only arise if the virus causing these diseases is also present, which is not the case in Gibraltar,\" the government said. \"The virus can, however, be imported by travellers returning from an overseas country and if this happens, there is a risk of spread, but only if the mosquito bites within a small window period of about a week after the fever starts.\" Public Health Gibraltar has been raising awareness of travel risk amongst travellers through its publication A Factsheet for Travellers and recommends the following precautions: - before travelling to affected areas, consult your doctor or seek advice from a travel clinic, especially if you have an immune disorder or severe chronic illness; - if you are pregnant or are considering pregnancy, consider postponing non-essential travel; - when staying in a mosquito-prone area, wear mosquito repellents and take mosquito bite prevention measures; - if you have symptoms within 3 weeks of return from an affected country, contact your doctor; - if you have been diagnosed with any of the diseases Zika, dengue, or chikungunya, take strict mosquito bite prevention measures for 10 days after the fever starts. Now it has been found in Gibraltar. The concerns are real about transmission of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses should populations of _Ae. albopictus_ become established. In 2015 there were a few locally acquired cases of dengue in the south of France. This also happened on a larger scale in Emilia Romagna, Italy, when a viremic man introduced chikungunya virus into Italy and sparked an outbreak. One hopes that mosquito surveillance will continue in Gibraltar, perhaps be intensified, and help guide vector control efforts. - Mod.TY   .

Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world. A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries. Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years. \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\" \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe.

It is important to note puffer fish are highly poisonous and should only prepared by trained, licensed chefs who know one bad cut means almost certain death for a customer. Surprisingly, the meat of some puffer fish is considered a delicacy, especially in Japan. But here's why you should perhaps avoid it completely:  - According to National Geographic, tetrodotoxin is deadly, up to 1200 times more poisonous than cyanide. One puffer fish has enough toxin to kill 30 adults.  - The puffer fish is the 2nd most poisonous vertebrate on the planet. Its poison has no antidote and kills by paralyzing the diaphragm, causing suffocation.  - Almost all puffer fish contain tetrodotoxin, a substance that makes them taste bad (and sometimes lethal) to other fish.  - Tetrodotoxin does not cross the blood-brain barrier, so the victims remain fully conscious while their central nervous system gradually shuts down. Symptoms such as numbness in the mouth, lips, and tongue occur within 30 minutes to 3 hours from an intake and after that, the victim begins to experience headaches, nausea and even vomiting. The rest of the body slowly becomes paralysed, causing death when the heart and lung muscles are also paralysed.  - In Japan, the most lethal part, the liver, cannot be sold, and the whole fish is banned in the European Union.  - There are more than 120 species of puffer fish worldwide. Most of them are found in tropical and subtropical ocean waters. However, some species live in brackish and even fresh water. They have long, tapered bodies with bulbous heads.  - The puffer fish protects itself in the wild by gulping down water and swelling up its belly to make itself look bigger. It does this because, apparently, it can't find a way to communicate the simple message, \"I am poisonous,\" says Byline: Mildred Europa Taylor  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail And Epicore member Addo Michael Brown Tetrodotoxin is a colorless crystal substance that darkens when heated above 400 degrees F or approximately 220 C. Tetrodotoxin is an extremely potent toxin (poison) found mainly in the liver and gonads of some fish, notably puffer fish, or fugu, but also globefish (sometimes puffer fish are also called globefish), and toadfish as well as some amphibians, octopus, and shellfish species. Human poisonings occur when the flesh and/or organs of the fish are improperly prepared and eaten. Tetrodotoxin interferes with the transmission of signals from nerves to muscles and causes an increasing paralysis of the muscles of the body. Tetrodotoxin poisoning can be fatal. These creatures are likely fatal when prepared inappropriately, and should be handled with extreme caution for the everyday untrained person. We are sorry for the families of these individuals.

A 5 year old girl is in a critical condition and 2 others are severely ill after eating a supermarket potato salad product infected with _Escherichia coli_ O157, Saitama Prefecture said on Mon 21 Aug 2017. The victims all ate potato salad sold at the Shokusaikan Marche Kagohara supermarket in the city of Kumagaya, Saitama prefecture, the prefecture said. In addition to the girl, who remains unconscious, a 4 year old boy and a 60 year old woman have been hospitalized. All 3 are not expected to be discharged soon. According to Saitama prefecture, the supermarket's deli  Derishasu Kagohara  procured the potato salad from a food-processing factory from outside the prefecture, then mixed cut pieces of ham and apples. The Kumagaya Public Health Center has ordered that the deli be closed for 3 days amid an investigation into the food poisoning, including what caused the _E. coli_ infection and the routes through which the salad was distributed. The incident came to light after the prefecture was notified of a boy being admitted to a Gunma prefecture hospital on 14 Aug 2017. The Kumagaya Public Health Center learned that 8 Saitama residents, who all ate the potato salad sold on 7 and 8 Aug 2017, complained of stomach pains. 3 others ranging in age from 7 to 12 were also hospitalized for symptoms such as diarrhea, but have been released from hospitals already. The 5 year old girl who remains in critical condition has been diagnosed with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a condition caused by an abnormal destruction of red blood cells. Fresh Corp, a Gunma-based supermarket and deli store chain, said no other outlets have reported cases of food poisoning. The firm has apologized for the incident on its website.  communicated by: ProMED-mail It is not clear if the individuals who became ill earlier in the month also suffered from enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ infection. Potato salad seems to be the vehicle for transmission of the infection. Since potatoes are served after cooking, the likely source is not the potatoes themselves but rather an ingredient added to the food. Pork products are not common carriers of EHEC but this has been reported (E. coli EHEC - Canada (04): (AB) O157, pork products, recall http://promedmail.org/post/20140909.2759887).

It is also possible that cross contamination during preparation from other foods could have occurred related to poor kitchen hygiene. ProMED-mail would like more information regarding this outbreak. It may be recalled by ProMED-mail readers and evident from the flurry of ProMED-mail postings from Japan in 1996 and 1997 shown below that substantially more cases of this disease occurred in that time frame.

The current media report, from a Kyrgyz source (citing a Kazakh newspaper), says that during the 2016 event, 6000 animals were infected, of which 600 died. An earlier media report, from Kazakhstan, dated 27 Jul 2016, said that the number of diseased animals \"exceeded 2000, of which 50 head of cattle died\" (see archive no. http://promedmail.org/post/20160727.4374008). Kazakhstan is the world's largest landlocked country, and the 9th largest in the world. The belated diagnosis in 2016, and its continued absence, so far, during the current event, is puzzling; following the acquiring of independence in Dec 1991, Kazakhstan obtained support from the West, particularly USA, in the establishment of state-of-the-art laboratories for research and diagnosis of infectious diseases in man and animals. Early report on the factual circulation and distribution of LSD within Kazakhstan is anticipated. Neighboring countries may take steps to prevent its introduction; those countries include China, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. Russia is LSD-infected (last follow-up report addressing 2 new outbreaks in Saratov oblast, adjacent to West Kazakhstan, published 24 Aug 2017). For the diagnosis of LSD, samples from clinically affected animals should preferably be derived from their typical dermal lesions; organs from dead animals which should be sent for laboratory tests are specified in OIE's Manual. The submission of \"meat of dead cows\" for testing in the laboratories, as reported, may not be ideal for timely diagnosis of LSD. - Mod.AS   .

It is understood that the government of Kazakhstan officially announced the presence, in 2017, of nodular dermatitis aka lumpy skin disease, LSD. 2. Russian and Kenyan LSD vaccines have been mentioned as the ones applied, and their effectiveness discussed. 3. Private owners of livestock suffer most, because the compensation for each sick cow is minimal. It is necessary to develop an effective compensation scheme for the smallholder livestock owners. 4. The following information on the 2016 LSD event in Kazakhstan was included in a report for the population, by the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic of Kazakhstan, AI Myrzahmetov, published on 2 Jun 2017: \"In 2016, 4 foci of nodular dermatitis outbreaks in cattle were reported in the Atyrau oblast. Amendments were made to the legislation and 185 million tenge (USD 551 300) were paid from the republican budget as compensation for the cost of animals that died from this disease. To date, all liquidation measures have been completed. Preventive vaccination of livestock in Atyrau oblast, as well as in 6 border areas of Aktobe Aqtobe (2) and West Kazakhstan (4) oblasts, are coming to an end.\"  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. ProMED-mail is very grateful to the submitter of the information above, addressing 4 issues raised in earlier postings on LSD in Kazakhstan. The following comments address the issues as numbered above: 1. Additional details (link?) of the mentioned official confirmation, by Kazakhstan's authorities, of the current (2017) LSD event will be helpful. The internationally customary (in fact, required) route for such an announcement is an immediate notification to the OIE. 2. The LSD vaccine applied in Russia (and exported) is, in fact, a sheep-pox vaccine which, following a testing procedure, was recently licensed also for the vaccination of cattle against LSD (see http://promedmail.org/post/20170511.5028821). The Kenyan O-240 vaccine has been recently found to include an LSD virus which underwent a low level of attenuation which may be not sufficient for safe use in cattle. It was suspected to cause clinical disease in vaccinated animals (see in http://promedmail.org/post/20140820.2708273). EU countries currently use a live-homologous LSD vaccine (South-Africa's Neetling virus strain). A European Union LSD vaccine bank has become operational since April 2016. Trials assessing an inactivated vaccine were reportedly undertaken, currently in their final stages. For a recent assessment of LSD vaccines, please see http://promedmail.org/post/20160812.4410864, including the commentary. OIE's Manual chapter on LSD, including exhaustive updated information, is available at  . 3. This comment is of high significance. Small-holders, worldwide, may be slow, or even tempted to refrain altogether from reporting the appearance of early signs of a reportable animal disease, if they expect compensations to be under the real damages and payments delayed. Such animals may be (illegally) sold, with consequent spread of disease and  eventually  higher national losses and expenditures. 4. The original text, in Kazakh and Russian, is available in Kazakhstan's Ministry of Agriculture blog, at  . In case the recent media reports on LSD spreading in Western Kazakhstan are confirmed, it will be of interest to note if the affected farms included vaccinated animals and which vaccines were used. Kazakhstan's official reporting on the 2016 LSD event was limited to a solitary notification on a single outbreak; no details of the vaccination (numbers and vaccinated animals, geography) were included. According to the recent official update, LSD was recorded, during 2016, in 4 locations within the Atyrau oblast. Timely and detailed information on the LSD situation in Kazakhstan is essential for the entire region. This applies also for another livestock disease suspected to be spreading in central Asia, namely PPR (peste des petits ruminants) in small ruminants. - Mod. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Kenya":{"487":{"title":"Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (90): Africa ","date":["24","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (90): Africa [EXTERNAL]","summary":"<br><br><strong> 3 Cholera - Sudan  Wed 23 Aug 2017 Source: UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), ReliefWeb, Radio Dabanga report edited South Darfur </strong><br> On Monday and Tuesday 21-22 Aug 2017 4 displaced people died of cholera and 49 others have been infected at camp Kalma in Nyala, capital of South Darfur.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea: \"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per cent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as \"potentially the most important medical advance\" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5). \"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.<br><br><strong> \"References </strong><br> 1.

Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world. A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries. Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years. \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\" \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea\". The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years 2 million DALYs since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln 13 million DALYs in the US, and 36-mln 36 million DALYs in Ethiopia. \"Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,\" continues Prof Melegaro \"our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population. Tailoring immunization campaigns to achieve measles eradication goals is essential and currently, for some countries, this means considering also the role of unprotected adolescents and young adults.

While it is recommended that children get 2 doses of MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine, starting with the 1st dose at 12 through 15 months of age, and the 2nd dose at 4 through 6 years of age, this study emphasizes that it is important that adolescents and young adults also are up to date on their MMR vaccination. - Mod.LK ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Kiribati":{},"Kosovo":{},"Kuwait":{},"Kyrgyzstan":{"489":{"title":"Lumpy skin disease, bovine - Kazakhstan (02): (WK) spread susp,\r\n\tRFI ","date":["24","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH> Lumpy skin disease, bovine - Kazakhstan (02): (WK) spread susp,\r\n\tRFI [EXTERNAL]","summary":"   Sun 20 Aug 2017 Source: Kloop (Kyrgyzstan) in Russian, machine trans., edited At least 120 head of cattle have been killed in the Atyrau region West Kazakhstan; the cause of the death of the animals is unknown.

The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are: - Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_; - Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam; - Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however, have suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be effective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and outbreak situations (63, 64).<br><br><strong> \"References -</strong><br> 57.

Multiple candidate Zika vaccines have been shown protective against infection with the virus in animal studies, with several now in human trials, but none were tested in the context of pregnancy, according to the authors of the study published in Cell  . The 2 vaccine candidates investigated in the new study are the 1st to demonstrate efficacy in preventing vertical transmission of the virus and related fetal death in an animal model. Although the vaccines were administered to female mice prior to pregnancy, the result is considered an important step toward developing a vaccine that could be safely given to pregnant women. One of the 2 candidates is a modified messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine encoding Zika genes, developed by the biotechnology company Moderna. It is already in safety trials in women who are not pregnant. The other is a live-attenuated Zika strain developed by researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). The testing was carried out by scientists from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Washington University School of Medicine, and UTMB. The researchers 1st vaccinated the mice with 1 of the vaccines or a placebo. After mating, the animals were challenged with the virus 6 days into pregnancy. A week later, more than 50 percent of placentas and fetuses from mice administered the mRNA vaccine had virtually no Zika RNA. The remainder had \"substantially lower\" levels relative to placebo. The live vaccine provided broader protection: 78 percent of placentas and 83 percent of fetuses had Zika RNA at or below the level of detection, while the placebo group exhibited significantly higher levels of placental and fetal Zika RNA. Mice vaccinated with either vaccine had significantly higher rates of fetal viability; whereas 100 percent of fetuses from mice vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine were born, none survived to term in the placebo group. A working group funded by the Wellcome Trust recently approved ethical guidelines for testing such vaccines in pregnant women, normally excluded from drug trials.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\.

In May 2017, health officials reported 2 imported cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in Senegal imported from Mauritania. A 3rd imported case was reported in June 2017. He developed headache, muscle and joints pains and diarrhea on 20 Aug 2017 and sought medical attention. He was treated with anti-malarial medicines and analgesics. After 2 days, he returned for medical care as his condition worsened. He was tested for CCHF because of bleeding manifestations and was IgM positive for Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The patient is still hospitalized and in stable clinical condition. Mauritania experienced a fairly large CCHF outbreak in 2003, involving 38 cases with a case fatality rate of 28.6 percent. According to the WHO, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is a widespread disease caused by a tick-borne virus (Nairovirus) of the Bunyaviridae family. The CCHF virus causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 percent. CCHF is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and Asian countries south of the 50th parallel north, the geographical limit of the principal tick vector. The hosts of the CCHF virus include a wide range of wild and domestic animals such as cattle, sheep and goats. Animals become infected by the bite of infected ticks, and the virus remains in their bloodstream for about one week after infection, allowing the tick-animal-tick cycle to continue when another tick bites. Although a number of tick genera are capable of becoming infected with CCHF virus, ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_ are the principal vectors. The CCHF virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians. Human-to-human transmission is possible. Byline: Robert Herriman  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. An outbreak of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever was documented in Nouakchott, the capital of Mauritania in 2003. The index case was detected on 18 Feb 2003. By 21 Mar 2003, the Ministry of Health of Mauritania had reported a total of 35 cases (18 laboratory confirmed) of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), including 6 deaths Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever - Mauritania (04) http://promedmail.org/post/20030324.0732. In the period from February to August 2003, 38 persons were infected with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus; 35 of these persons were residents of Nouakchott. The 1st patient was a young woman who became ill shortly after butchering a goat. She transmitted the infection to 15 persons in the hospital where she was admitted and 4 members of her family. In Nouakchott, 2 disease clusters and 11 isolated cases were identified. Of the patients not infected by the 1st case-patient, almost half were butchers, which suggests that the primary mode of animal-to-human transmission was direct contact with blood of infected animals. Cattle heavily infested with ticks were more likely to be CCHFV seropositive, and vector control to reduce the tick burden can result in reduced seroprevalence. Cattle are noted as the most sensitive indicator of low-level CCHFV circulation because they tend to be highly infested with _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks, which are the most common vectors of CCHF  . The circulation of CCHF virus and the high prevalence of infected animals and ticks have been well documented in Mauritanian farming areas since 1983 Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever and Rift Valley fever in south-eastern Mauritania.

However, the introduction of viruses such as Zika, chikungunya or dengue into New Mexico will continue, so aggressive vector surveillance and control will be important to limit populations of these vectors. - Mod.TY   .

Vaccines protect fetus from Zika. JAMA. 2017; 318(8): 689. doi:10.1001/jama.2017.<br><br><strong>11200 </strong><br> Researchers funded in part by the National Institutes of Health have recently demonstrated that 2 experimental vaccines can restrict transmission of Zika virus from pregnant mice to their fetuses, thereby shielding offspring from congenital damage or death. Multiple candidate Zika vaccines have been shown protective against infection with the virus in animal studies, with several now in human trials, but none were tested in the context of pregnancy, according to the authors of the study published in Cell  . The 2 vaccine candidates investigated in the new study are the 1st to demonstrate efficacy in preventing vertical transmission of the virus and related fetal death in an animal model. Although the vaccines were administered to female mice prior to pregnancy, the result is considered an important step toward developing a vaccine that could be safely given to pregnant women. One of the 2 candidates is a modified messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine encoding Zika genes, developed by the biotechnology company Moderna. It is already in safety trials in women who are not pregnant. The other is a live-attenuated Zika strain developed by researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). The testing was carried out by scientists from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Washington University School of Medicine, and UTMB. The researchers 1st vaccinated the mice with 1 of the vaccines or a placebo. After mating, the animals were challenged with the virus 6 days into pregnancy. A week later, more than 50 percent of placentas and fetuses from mice administered the mRNA vaccine had virtually no Zika RNA. The remainder had \"substantially lower\" levels relative to placebo. The live vaccine provided broader protection: 78 percent of placentas and 83 percent of fetuses had Zika RNA at or below the level of detection, while the placebo group exhibited significantly higher levels of placental and fetal Zika RNA. Mice vaccinated with either vaccine had significantly higher rates of fetal viability; whereas 100 percent of fetuses from mice vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine were born, none survived to term in the placebo group. A working group funded by the Wellcome Trust recently approved ethical guidelines for testing such vaccines in pregnant women, normally excluded from drug trials.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. It is reassuring to learn that at least 2 vaccines are now entering clinical trials in women. Although anti-Zika virus drugs are under development, preventing infection through vaccination seems to be the most effective measure to prevent fetal infection and adverse effects of the virus infection in adults. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Mayotte":{},"Micronesia":{},"Moldova":{},"Monaco":{},"Mongolia":{},"Montenegro":{},"Morocco":{},"Mozambique":{"90":{"title":"Anthrax - Mozambique: (MP) wildlife, OIE ","date":["22","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH/EDR> Anthrax - Mozambique: (MP) wildlife, OIE [EXTERNAL]","summary":"Not calculated because of missing information Epidemiology: Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: endemic foci Control measures: Measures applied: surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; quarantine; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals Measures to be applied: no other measures Diagnostic test results: Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result Kruger National Park State Laboratory (Foreign laboratory) / African Elephant / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / Pending Magudi District Veterinary Laboratory (Private Laboratory) / African Elephant / microscopic examination / 11 Aug 2017 / Positive Future Reporting: the event is continuing.

ProMED-mail thanks Dr Sher Bahadur Pun for continued contributions to ProMED-mail on scrub typhus in Nepal. Scrub typhus is caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a rickettsia-like microorganism that is transmitted by chiggers, the larval stage of trombiculid mites, which feed on the skin cells of animals, including humans and rodents. After feeding on their hosts, chiggers drop to the ground and become nymphs, which then mature into adults that feed only on plant materials. The cutaneous reaction to chiggers leaves a characteristic black eschar that is useful for making the diagnosis. Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the infected chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation. Rodents may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_ in nature ( ). - Mod.ML ","keywordsMatched":[]},"91":{"title":"Chikungunya (27) - Americas, Europe, Asia ","date":["18","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Chikungunya (27) - Americas, Europe, Asia [EXTERNAL]","summary":"<br><br><strong> Cases in various countries: Regional summaries - Americas -</strong><br> WHO/PAHO report 18 Aug 2017 Reported cases of chikungunya fever in the Americas, by country or territory - 2017 to EW 33 week ending 18 Aug 2017.

Given the outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections in the region, and the clinical similarity of cases of that virus infection and CHIKV infection, one wonders how many cases that were not laboratory confirmed but clinically diagnosed as ZIKV infections were, in reality, CHIKV infections. It is also possible that a significant proportion of the population have been infected by CHIKV in the previous 3 years and are now immune. It seems likely, however, that CHIKV is now endemic in the Americas, and sporadic, small outbreaks may continue to occur as they do in Asia and Africa. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"94":{"title":"Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (88): Africa,\r\n\tAsia ","date":["22","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (88): Africa,\r\n\tAsia [EXTERNAL]","summary":" 6 Diarrhea - Nepal (Kapilvastu district)  Sun 20 Aug 2017 Source: The Himalayan Times edited A child has reportedly succumbed to diarrhea in Sattbhara, of Maharajgunj Municipality-7 in Kapilvastu district Province Five on Sun 20 Aug 2017.

The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are: - Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_; - Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam; - Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however, have suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be effective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and outbreak situations (63, 64).<br><br><strong> \"References -</strong><br> 57.

Since 2010, and as of March 2017, the FMDV strain circulating in Nepal has continuously been O/ME-SA/Ind-2001d (in 2015, there was also a single detection of O/ME-SA/PanAsia-2 KAT-15). For the said and additional information on Nepal's FMD past records, including genotyping results (though not yet of the newly introduced A/ASIA/G-VII lineage), see  . The identification of the A/ASIA/G-VII lineage in Nepal represents further spread of this virus, which had been evolving in India many years back (\"A/IND/40/2000\", genotyped A/ASIA/G-VII, was collected in 1999). In 2010, this strain was detected in Myanmar. In 2015, it appeared for the 1st time in the Middle East (\"FMD Pool 3\"), being detected in Saudi Arabia followed, during the same year, by Iran, Turkey and Armenia. Most recently (May 2017), this virus was identified in Northern Israel, on the Lebanese and Syrian borders. According to the information included in the Guest Editor's comments to EuFMD's (European Commission for the control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease) monthly report \"Global Foot-and-Mouth Disease Situation\", June 2017, there were reports of poor performance of vaccine strains derived from the A/ASIA/Iran-05 strain against the A/ASIA/G-VII lineage.

The said data were to \"be presented in more detail shortly\". The said and additional information is available at  . The Indian subcontinent (\"FMD Pool 2\") is the source of 2 FMD strains which have demonstrated, in recent years, a long-distance (trans-regional) transmission, causing losses in \"FMD Pool 3\" countries and threatening Europe. These are FMDV serotype O, topotype ME-SA, strain Ind-2001d and FMDV serotype A, topotype Asia, genotype (strain) VII.

It is quite surprising for me observing such a large number of ST cases being detected in Kathmandu, the biggest and most densely populated area of Nepal. Because ST has previously been almost exclusively detected in rural areas of Nepal. What is not yet clear is the impact of ST between the years 2004 and 2015. ST was first well documented in 2004 in Kathmandu (1), while the significant number of ST cases has only been detected since 2015. The widespread use of antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin, could be one possible explanation. In other words, healthcare workers in Nepal usually view any fever as typhoid fever, thus used to treat febrile patients with ciprofloxacin, which might have also worked simultaneously against ST too. However, nowadays, cefixime has become the drug of choice for typhoid fever, and it may, however, not work effectively against ST, resulting in emergence of ST in Nepal.<br><br><strong> Reference -</strong><br> 1.

Doxycycline is the drug of choice and it is preferred over other tetracyclines for treatment of scrub typhus; it is rarely associated with staining of teeth in children younger than 8 years (1). Macrolides, such as azithromycin, are also reported to be efficacious (2). Fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, have been reported to be clinically effective in the treatment of scrub typhus in a few patients. However, some clinical studies suggest that fluoroquinolones are not as effective in patients with scrub typhus as other antibiotics (3,4). In vitro testing of some strains of _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, the cause of scrub typhus, has been reported to show resistance to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin (minimum inhibitory concentration=8 micrograms/mL) (5) and mutation in the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) of the gyrA gene associated with fluoroquinolone resistance has been found (3,5). These findings suggest that fluoroquinolones are likely not appropriate for the treatment of scrub typhus.<br><br><strong> References </strong><br> 1. Panpanich R, Garner P.

Nigeria accounts for 61 per cent of yam production in the world. \"Seed yam is a big problem,\" said Robert Aseidu, International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA). \"It's only now that we're seeing how big a problem this could become.\" Due to many years of flawed farm practice, most seed yams have disease. Farmers traditionally keep back the measlier poorer. - Mod.SH yams for planting. \"They keep accumulating diseases and productivity keeps reducing until you get to a stage where it's no longer economical to plant,\" says Beatrice Aighewi, IITA. Some scientists have seen the urgent need and high demand for disease free seed yams. Aighewi says the solution to Nigeria's seed yam crisis is large-scale aeroponic seed yam production. She also produces high-yielding and disease-resistant yam varieties. byline: Uwagbale Edward-Ekpu  communicated by: ProMED-mail Yam (_Dioscorea_ spp.) is an important tuber crop in Africa, the West Indies and parts of Asia and southern America. A number of fungal (anthracnose, leaf blight, tuber rots), bacterial (pre- and post-harvest wet rots), viral (mosaic, 'shoe-string') and nematode (dry rot) diseases or disease complexes are known to affect the crop. Many of these have been reported from West Africa, including Nigeria (see links below). For predominantly vegetatively propagated crops, including root and tuber crops like yam, potato, taro and cassava, accumulation of multiple viral and other pathogens over successive planting cycles is a high risk. Even low levels of seed tuber infections pose a major risk of both horizontal and vertical pathogen spread. A build up of both numbers and individual levels of pathogens over the planting cycles will eventually lead to weaker and weaker crops, as described above for yams. To return to viable crop production, exclusive use of planting material that was certified, preferably by molecular methods, as being free of pathogens is essential for each crop cycle. Farm saved or other uncertified propagating materials (including seeds, budwood, rootstocks, seed tubers, cuttings) have often been reported as sources of crop disease outbreaks worldwide. Clean planting stock is vital for successful agricultural systems and, consequently, certification schemes have been set up for relevant crops in many countries. In aeroponic systems, as mentioned above, plants are grown in a mist environment, without a medium to support their roots. This differs from hydroponics, where plant roots are immersed in a liquid nutrient solution. In both systems, disease (and pest) control is aided by the absence of soil and minimal requirements for handling the plants during growth.DHA ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"North Korea":{},"Northern Mariana Island":{},"Norway":{},"Oman":{},"Pakistan":{"48":{"title":"Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (86): Africa,\r\n\tAsia ","date":["18","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (86): Africa,\r\n\tAsia [EXTERNAL]","summary":" 4 Cholera - Pakistan (Punjab Province)  Wed 16 Aug 2017 Source: The News edited The number of cases of cholera, a highly contagious and fatal disease is continuously on the rise and there is a threat that spread of the infection may take shape of an epidemic if proper preventive and control measures are not taken well in time. The 1st 2 cases of cholera were tested positive by National Institute of Health Islamabad on Mon 31 Jul 2017 and another 2 confirmed positive for the infection on Fri 4 Aug 2017. All the 4 patients were undergoing treatment at Benazir Bhutto Hospital BH where as many as 4 more suspects of the infection have been admitted for treatment. Data collected by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017 reveals that the allied hospitals have sent stool samples of over 10 child patients to NIH for confirmation of cholera in last week week of Sun 6 Aug 2017. On Sat 12 Aug 2017, as many as 20 child patients with severe diarrhoea were admitted at the BBH of which 4 were suspected as patients of cholera and their stool samples were sent to NIH for confirmation, said Associate Professor of Paediatrics at Rawalpindi Medical University Dr Tariq Saeed when contacted by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017. He added the hospital has not received confirmation reports from the NIH because of holidays there from Saturday to Monday. However, we have been keeping the suspects in isolation under strict monitoring, he said. He added that repeated rainfalls in the region and water inundation inside and outside homes in a number of localities particularly in thickly populated areas of the city are causing contamination of water and foodstuff that increases chances of spread of a number of infections among population while children are at greater risk of contracting life-threatening infections including cholera. It is important that the transmission of cholera occurs primarily by drinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the feces (waste product) of an infected person, including one with no apparent symptoms. It is observed that heavy rainfall causes collection of heavily contaminated water in streets and houses and the waste water flooding out of various nullahs watercourses including Nullah Leh in town causes infections including cholera, typhoid, dysentery, gastroenteritis, hepatitis A and E, shigellosis and giardiasis. Professor Tariq said the consumption of contaminated water and foodstuff causes cholera, an infection in the small intestine caused by bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. Its main symptoms are watery diarrhea and vomiting that can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, and death in cases which are not treated in time, he said. Health experts say that to avoid cholera and other infections, one must use boiled water for drinking and should use vegetables after washing with clean water and it must be kept in mind that raw vegetables should not be eaten in the existing weather conditions instead these should be used after cooking. To a query, Professor Tariq said the heavy rainfall and water accumulation may contaminate water at sources and there may be chances of contamination of water at tube wells so individuals must boil water before drinking to avoid cholera and other infections. He added the appearance of cholera is alarming and it is time for people to take extra ordinary preventive measures to safeguard their children and themselves from the disease. In case water is accumulated inside home due to heavy rainfall and flooded out of sewage lines, it must be wiped out immediately and the space should be washed with clean water as soon as possible to avoid infections. Avoiding inundation of contaminated water inside homes is a must to avoid cholera and other infections, said Professor Tariq.

The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80 percent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:  - Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_; - Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65 percent (95 percent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam;  - Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products which are given in 2 doses.

According to NIH, the objective of this advice was to sensitize human and animal health care authorities to further strengthen and improve the level of preparedness in prevention and control of CCHF. The notice, which was issued by the NIH Field Epidemiology and Disease Surveillance Division, said that the CCHF is a widespread disease caused by a tickborne virus (Nairovirus) of the Bunyaviridae family with a case fatality rate of 10 to 40 per cent. It added that the ticks, especially of the _Hyalomma_ genus, are both a reservoir and a vector for the CCHF while numerous wild and domestic animals such as cattle, buffaloes, goats and sheep are silent carriers of this virus, and the adult ticks feed on these animals. The notice said that although Balochistan remains the most affected province, cases have been reported from almost all parts of the country. During 2016, out of 101 confirmed cases, 33 patients died. During 2017, till date, a total of 41 confirmed cases have been reported including 16 from Balochistan, 15 from Punjab, 7 from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and 3 from FATA. The advisory notice said that the virus is transmitted to the people either through tick bites or through contact with the infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughtering them. Public health workers along with animal herders, veterinarians, para-veterinary staff, livestock workers, animal merchants, butchers and slaughterhouse workers are at risk of the disease. Apart from the above mentioned, people close to or taking care of a suspected patient, and individuals involved in burial practices are also at a risk of getting infected, it added. There is currently no vaccine available for humans and the only way to reduce infection is by raising awareness. The notice further added that public health advice should focus on several aspects including wearing protective clothing  such as long sleeves and trousers. People should be advised to wear light coloured clothes during a visit to the animal market to allow easy detection of ticks, and to regularly examine clothing and skin for ticks and if found, removing them safely and using approved repellents on clothing and skin. Similarly, citizens have been asked not to crush the ticks, wear gloves and other protective clothing while handling animals or their tissues, notably during slaughtering, butchering and culling procedures in slaughterhouses or at home. They have also been asked to avoid close physical contact with infected people, wearing gloves and protective equipment when taking care of them. People are also asked to wash hands frequently during caring or after visiting a patient. The notice stated that insect repellents are the most effective in warding off ticks in human populations.  communicated by: ProMED-mail The National Institute of Health Pakistan has issued this CCHF advisory notice in view of the upcoming Eid Ul Adha, when large numbers of livestock and cattle are moved from rural areas to urban markets for sale and subsequent slaughter. More spatial repellent products are becoming commercially available. These products, containing active ingredients such as metofluthrin and allethrin, augment aerosol insecticide sprays, vaporizing mats, and mosquito coils, which have been available for some time. Such products can help to clear rooms or areas of mosquitoes (spray aerosols) or repel mosquitoes from a circumscribed area (coils, spatial repellents). Although many of these products appear to have repellent or insecticidal activity under particular conditions, they have not yet been adequately evaluated in peer-reviewed studies for their efficacy in preventing vectorborne disease. Travelers should supplement the use of these products with repellent on skin or clothing and using bed nets in areas where vectorborne diseases are a risk or biting arthropods are noted  . CDC has evaluated information published in peer-reviewed scientific literature and data available from EPA to identify several types of EPA-registered products that provide repellent activity sufficient to help people reduce the bites of disease-carrying mosquitoes. Products containing the following active ingredients typically provide reasonably long-lasting protection:  - DEET (chemical name: N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide or N,N-diethyl-3-methyl-benzamide). Products containing DEET include, but are not limited to, Off!, Cutter, Sawyer, and Ultrathon.  - Picaridin (KBR 3023 Bayrepel and icaridin outside the US; chemical name: 2-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperidinecarboxylic acid 1-methylpropyl ester). Products containing picaridin include, but are not limited to, Cutter Advanced, Skin So Soft Bug Guard Plus, and Autan (outside the US).  - Oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE) or PMD (chemical name: para-menthane-3,8-diol), the synthesized version of OLE. Products containing OLE and PMD include, but are not limited to, Repel and Off ! Botanicals. This recommendation refers to EPA-registered products containing the active ingredient OLE (or PMD). \"Pure\" oil of lemon eucalyptus (essential oil not formulated as a repellent) is not recommended; it has not undergone similar, validated testing for safety and efficacy and is not registered with EPA as an insect repellent.  - IR3535 (chemical name: 3-N-butyl-N-acetyl-aminopropionic acid, ethyl ester). Products containing IR3535 include, but are not limited to, Skin So Soft Bug Guard Plus Expedition and SkinSmart.  - 2-undecanone (chemical name: methyl nonyl ketone). The product BioUD contains 2-undecanone. Published data indicate that repellent efficacy and duration of protection vary considerably among products and among mosquito and tick species. Product efficacy and duration of protection are also markedly affected by ambient temperature, level of activity, amount of perspiration, exposure to water, abrasive removal, and other factors. In general, higher concentrations of active ingredient provide longer duration of protection, regardless of the active ingredient. Products with less than 10 per cent active ingredient may offer only limited protection, often 1-2 hours. Products that offer sustained-release or controlled-release (microencapsulated) formulations, even with lower active ingredient concentrations, may provide longer protection times. Studies suggest that concentrations of DEET above approximately 50 per cent do not offer a marked increase in protection time against mosquitoes; DEET efficacy tends to plateau at a concentration of about 50 per cent. CDC recommends using products with at least 20 per cent DEET on exposed skin to reduce biting by ticks that may spread disease. DEET-containing repellents prevent both mosquito and tick bites. Health Canada recommends using a product containing no more than 10 per cent DEET for children up to 12 years of age. However, products with a DEET concentration of 10 per cent or less should not be used for exposures lasting longer than 1 h to 2 h because they may not be effective in preventing tick bites. For children over 12 years of age and adults, a repellent containing up to 30 per cent DEET can be used as recommended on the product label. In the United States, 30 per cent DEET is approved for children aged 2 months of age and older. Reapplication of DEET is indicated only if the estimated protection period has passed and a significant risk of arthropod bites remains. Adverse events from DEET are rare. Contact dermatitis and eye irritation are the commonest side effects. Toxic encephalopathy has been reported, usually with prolonged or excessive use, or occasional DEET ingestion  . Permethrin, a synthetic pyrethroid , is highly effective both as an insecticide and as a repellent. It is not licensed to be used as a topical repellent but can be sprayed on clothing (mesh jackets, hats, shoes) bed nets and camping gear to repel and kill ticks, mosquitoes and other insects. - Mod.UBA   .

Given the outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections in the region, and the clinical similarity of cases of that virus infection and CHIKV infection, one wonders how many cases that were not laboratory confirmed but clinically diagnosed as ZIKV infections were, in reality, CHIKV infections. It is also possible that a significant proportion of the population have been infected by CHIKV in the previous 3 years and are now immune.

Japanese encephalitis is a viral disease spread by blood-sucking insects, particularly mosquitoes. The mosquitoes of the _Culex_ species are known to be the viral carriers. The DOH said it affects the nervous system, causes severe complications and even death. The disease can infect not only humans but domestic animals, birds, bats, snakes, and frogs as well. Among the symptoms of Japanese encephalitis, according to the DOH, are flu-like illnesses, fever, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, and tiredness. The symptoms usually appear 6-8 days after the mosquito bite. If untreated, patients could suffer brain damage or paralysis as it also affects the spinal cord. In 30 percent of the cases, death could occur. Young children are more vulnerable due to their weak immune system. While there is no cure, the virus could be prevented through vaccination. A separate report from the World Health Organization (WHO) said that Japanese encephalitis is an illness that is endemic in the Philippines and is fatal in almost 3 out of 10 serious cases. The WHO report also said that nearly all survivors of this mosquito-borne disease experience permanent damage, including physical disabilities, cognitive and language problems, learning disabilities and behavioral problems. Byline: Ian Ocampo Flora  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail This is a cluster of Japanese encephalitis in central Luzon Island. Clusters have been relatively rare in the Philippines. There have been relatively few reports of human Japanese encephalitis (JE) cases in the Philippines in recent years, although the islands are within the JE virus endemic zone. Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable encephalitis in Asia and the western Pacific. It is caused by a virus transmitted by culicine mosquitoes. Ardeid birds (including herons) are the reservoir species in nature. Most human infections are asymptomatic or result in only mild symptoms. However, a small percentage of infected persons develop encephalitis, with symptoms including sudden onset of headache, high fever, disorientation, coma, tremors, and convulsions. About 1 in 4 encephalitis cases is fatal. Apparently, none of the cases in the report above died. There is no specific treatment for JE. Patient management focuses on supportive care and management of complications. Steps to prevent JE virus infections include vaccination and use of personal protective measures to prevent mosquito bites. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"195":{"title":"Avian influenza, human (68): Philippines, H5N6 ","date":["22","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH/EDR> Avian influenza, human (68): Philippines, H5N6 [EXTERNAL]","summary":"   Thu 24 Aug 2016 Source: CNN Philippines edited The bird flu that has hit parts of the Philippines has been confirmed to be H5N6  a strain that can be transmitted to humans. This was confirmed upon receipt of laboratory results from test samples that were sent to Australia. Agriculture officials were quick to assure, however, that the strain is slow to spread and causes few deaths. \"The rate of transmission is very, very low,\" Arlene Vytiaco, who heads animal disease control in the Bureau of Animal Industry, said in a press briefing on Thursday. She explained that countries like Japan and Myamnar have been affected by H5N6 but have reported no humans infected by the avian influenza. \"The mortality rate is also low,\" Vytiaco said. Since H5N6 started in 2014, only 20 deaths have been reported worldwide. The Department of Health has been conducting regular check-ups on farmers and workers in areas hit by the bird flu outbreak.

The government had been waiting to see what the bird flu's specific N strain was - particularly on the lookout for the N1 and N6 strains, which can be passed on to humans. Local tests had confirmed it was not the far deadlier H5N1 virus. However, it had to send samples to Australia to check whether it was H5N6, since the government did not have its own test kits here. This was said by Dr Arlene Vytiaco, who oversees disease control for the Bureau of Animal Industry. Reports of bird flu being present were 1st reported earlier this month August 2017. The virus was found in birds from 7 farms in San Luis, Pampanga. The Department of Agriculture DA earlier said the virus had been present since April 2017, but was only reported in August 2017 after 37 000 birds had died. It added the strain of avian flu present in these birds was not transmissible to humans. On Sun 13 Aug 2017, agriculture secretary Manny Piñol said another round of tests was under way to determine whether H5N6  the strain of the virus that can be passed on to humans  was present.

He said the children died around 2 weeks ago. Calauan and San Pablo City, being adjacent to each other, were also placed under investigation by the health office. Only the Calauan case has so far reached the Calabarzon office of the Department of Health, according to Dr Rio Magpantay, DOH regional director. The regional office, however, had also started monitoring \"signs and symptoms\" of possible Japanese encephalitis incidence in other parts of Laguna. Calabarzon stands for the provinces of Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, and Quezon. The disease, which is transmitted by the _Culex_ mosquito, commonly causes abdominal pains, fever, and seizures. It may also cause a part of the brain to swell. Vaccines are available. But there is no cure yet for the disease. Vaccines are currently not part of the government's immunization program.

There have been relatively few reports of human Japanese encephalitis (JE) cases in the Philippines in recent years, although the islands are within the JE virus endemic zone. The report above is of 2 cases. Also on Luzon Island this year (2017), the Department of Health (DOH) has recorded a total of 149 cases of JE with at least 22 cases in noted Pampanga, the highest in the Central Luzon region (see Japanese encephalitis - Philippines: (PM) http://promedmail.org/post/20170818.5257940). A report from the World Health Organization (WHO) said that JE is an illness that is endemic in the Philippines and is fatal in almost 3 out of 10 serious cases. The report also said that nearly all survivors of this mosquito-borne disease experience permanent damage, including physical disabilities, cognitive and language problems, learning disabilities and behavioral problems. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Poland":{"55":{"title":"African swine fever - Europe (18): Czech Republic (ZK)\r\n\twild boar, spread, control ","date":["18","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH/EDR> African swine fever - Europe (18): Czech Republic (ZK)\r\n\twild boar, spread, control [EXTERNAL]","summary":"   Fri 18 Aug 2017 Source: Web-site of the Czech State Veterinary Administration Czech, Mach transl, edited As of the above date, 159 dead feral pigs have been recorded by the State Veterinary Administration in the Zlín Region.

DEFRA UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs has upgraded the threat to the UK from 'very low' to 'low'  meaning the risk is \"rare but could occur\" (EFSA European Food Safety Authority terminology). This severe disease of pigs entered Europe through Georgia in 2007, and has since continued to the Russian Federation and eastern Europe, including EU countries in the Baltic States, Poland and very recently the Czech Republic, in wild boar. In early August 2017, an outbreak was confirmed for the 1st time in Romania among backyard pigs. African swine fever is caused by infection with ASF virus (ASFV), which can have fatality rates of up to 100 per cent. The virus causes acute disease in domestic pigs and wild boar, and may cause varying clinical signs that are similar to other pig diseases such as high fever, lethargy and loss of appetite. Pigs may also die suddenly without clinical signs. Although the virus does not cause disease in humans, the impact it has on the economy, especially through trade and farming, is substantial. As a consequence of ASF in Poland and the Baltic States the value of pork and pig exports was reduced by USD 960 million (2014-2015). In Denmark, the predicted impact of an ASF outbreak is estimated at USD 12 million in direct losses and USD 349 million in exports. Unless the appropriate control measures are put in place, additional outbreaks could occur across Europe, further into Russia and beyond to Asia. An outbreak in the UK is unlikely as imports of meat and pigs are extremely well regulated and the UK does not have a wild boar population substantial enough or widespread enough to maintain an outbreak. However, personal imports of pork products from affected areas could result in disease incursion if deliberately or accidently fed to pigs or wild boar, actions which are illegal. The seriousness of an outbreak for some countries could be far worse than others; China is home to over half the world's pig population and an outbreak of ASF could result in devastating consequences. In a Veterinary Record article see reference below world-expert on ASF Dr Linda Dixon leader of the ASF group at The Pirbright Institute, outlines the factors that increase the likelihood of ASF spreading to China and highlights areas that could be improved to reduce the risk of an outbreak including biosecurity.  communicated by: ProMED-mail Subscribers may refer to more data in the article above, addressing the following questions: - how does ASF spread? - how quickly does it spread? - how can the spread of ASFV be prevented? - what is The Pirbright Institute doing to help?

Emerg Microbes Infect. 2017; 6(8): e69. doi: 10.1038/emi.2017.<br><br><strong>59  Abstract </strong><br> Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has recently been associated with an increased incidence of neonatal microcephaly and other neurological disorders. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito bite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some cases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main vector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other mosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the virus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit ZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of laboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. Interestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the midgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in Recife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially fed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx. quinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced. Collectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range of ZIKV vectors than anticipated.  <br><br>Communicated by: Roland Hübner Superior Health Council Brussels Belgium Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active virus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their ability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step toward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_ fed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in saliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing. The study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a competent vector. Several other studies have shown this species to be inefficient vectors or refractory to Zika virus infection. One wonders if the specific _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ used or the Zika virus isolates with which they were tested could account for these very different results. Resolving these discrepancies is important because this mosquito species is very widely distributed around the world and bears directly on risk of outbreaks in geographic areas where _Aedes aegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_ , Zika virus vectors, do not occur. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"749":{"title":"Zika virus (17): Americas, research, observations ","date":["24","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Zika virus (17): Americas, research, observations [EXTERNAL]","summary":" 6 Vaccine update  22/29 Aug 2017 Source: Journal of the American Medical Association, JAMA edited ref: Lyon J.

Multiple candidate Zika vaccines have been shown protective against infection with the virus in animal studies, with several now in human trials, but none were tested in the context of pregnancy, according to the authors of the study published in Cell  . The 2 vaccine candidates investigated in the new study are the 1st to demonstrate efficacy in preventing vertical transmission of the virus and related fetal death in an animal model. Although the vaccines were administered to female mice prior to pregnancy, the result is considered an important step toward developing a vaccine that could be safely given to pregnant women. One of the 2 candidates is a modified messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine encoding Zika genes, developed by the biotechnology company Moderna. It is already in safety trials in women who are not pregnant. The other is a live-attenuated Zika strain developed by researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). The testing was carried out by scientists from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Washington University School of Medicine, and UTMB. The researchers 1st vaccinated the mice with 1 of the vaccines or a placebo. After mating, the animals were challenged with the virus 6 days into pregnancy. A week later, more than 50 percent of placentas and fetuses from mice administered the mRNA vaccine had virtually no Zika RNA. The remainder had \"substantially lower\" levels relative to placebo. The live vaccine provided broader protection: 78 percent of placentas and 83 percent of fetuses had Zika RNA at or below the level of detection, while the placebo group exhibited significantly higher levels of placental and fetal Zika RNA. Mice vaccinated with either vaccine had significantly higher rates of fetal viability; whereas 100 percent of fetuses from mice vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine were born, none survived to term in the placebo group.

Measles vaccination coverage is suboptimal in Italy (ranging between 85.4 percent and 90.6 percent for one dose during the period 2007-2016) 1, which has led to large pockets of susceptible adults. We describe an outbreak in an Italian hospital between February and April 2017 among healthcare workers (HCW), hospital support personnel (hospital workers in activities not involving direct contact with patients), hospital visitors and community contacts. This outbreak was part of a wider epidemic in Italy that started in January 2017 and has, as at Sun 30 Jul 2017, led to 4001 cases nationwide (275 in HCW) 2.<br><br><strong> Outbreak description </strong><br> A HCW was referred to the emergency department (ED) of an Italian hospital for a rash developed after taking antibacterials for a mild cough and coryza. The rash was considered an allergic reaction to the antibacterial and the HCW was admitted to the hospital inpatient clinic. Three days later, the HCW's child was admitted to hospital for a rash diagnosed as due to a non-communicable systemic disease. Subsequent serology showed that both the HCW and the child had measles. The origin of the infection for the index case is still unknown. It should be noted, however, that at least 10 community cases of measles occurred in the same period in the area of residence of the HCW. Using the standard case definition of the European Commission 3, a total of 34 measles cases during the following weeks were identified by tracing the contacts of the index case. Among them, 15 were HCWs, 5 were support personnel, 4 were hospital visitors and 11 were community contacts of the above cases. The secondary cases to the index (n = 8) occurred in 2 of the HCW's relatives, in 4 other HCWs, and in 2 support workers who were not immediately recognized as belonging to the hospital outbreak. One of the secondary cases, a HCW, was in service until the onset of symptoms, accessing all rooms on 2 inpatient wards. Tertiary cases (n = 6) involved the family of this HCW, 3 HCWs and a member of support personnel. A total of 2 weeks after the admission of the index case, 2 of the HCWs belonging to tertiary cases presented during the night to the ED where they stayed for nearly 10 hours. An additional 15 cases could be traced following this single exposure window, namely 7 HCWs, 2 support workers, 3 relatives of theirs and 3 visitors to the ED during the time the 2 HCWs were present. One more community case was related to contact outside hospital with one of the tertiary HCW cases. Additional cases were related to a visitor at one of the involved inpatient wards, who probably got in contact with one of the tertiary cases who were HCW during the incubation period and generated 3 cases in the community, among them a family pediatrician.

Sixteen were unvaccinated (2 children, 14 adults), 2 had received one dose, one a full course of 2 doses, and 5 cases occurred in contacts who received one dose of post-exposure vaccination. Of the 5 contacts who received post exposure vaccine, one was an infant younger than one year for whom information about the date of vaccination is not available; for the other 4, the delay between presumed contact date and immunization was 3 days in 2 cases, 6 and 12 days for the remaining 2 cases. Among the HCWs, 2 were vaccinated, 11 were unvaccinated and for 2 of them the data was unavailable. Among the 5 cases belonging to support personnel 2 were unvaccinated and the status was unknown for the remaining 3. Genotyping was available for 3 cases: genotype B3, subtype 3.1 was found in all of them.<br><br><strong> Conclusion and recommendations -</strong><br> Measles elimination in Europe, despite the immunization efforts, is still jeopardized by recurrent outbreaks in susceptible populations 4-7. Nosocomial transmission of measles is an important and emerging way of spreading the infection 8-11. Anyone staying in the hospital environment, regardless of role, can be affected because measles is highly contagious and persists in the environment for up to 2 hours, thus requiring appropriate and timely infection control measures 12,13. Considering that transmission may occur 3 days before the onset of rash, early diagnosis when only non-specific preliminary symptoms (cough, coryza and conjunctivitis) are present is crucial for containing the outbreak 14. A single exposure window, that occurred 2 weeks after the admission of the index case, when 2 cases were present in the ED, resulted in further 15 cases. Appropriate procedures are needed for patients with suspect transmissible infection in the ED, an issue not limited to measles but shared with several other highly infective conditions 13. A 2-dose vaccination is the most effective measure to prevent measles 15. This is of crucial importance for HCWs, with a view to their higher risk of exposure and of transmission to vulnerable patients. However, it should be noted that in at least 5 cases in this outbreak, measles occurred in personnel working in the hospital environment in support functions, highlighting the need to take into consideration the role of such personnel in the spread of the infection. Given that most of the support personnel belong to outsourced services, coordination is needed between occupational health unit and occupational health responsible of outsourced services.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail The full report can be found at the source URL. - Mod.ML There is no doubt that inadequate immunization levels are the major contributor to outbreaks of measles. Most of this is due to not receiving the 2 doses of vaccine due to personal or parenteral choice. Aggressive programs to reverse this unfortunate trend are needed to prevent outbreaks of this potentially lethal disease. The nosocomial setting as reflected in the 3rd post represents a special case situation. It is not clear why health care workers are not required to be immunized for measles. Additionally, when a case of measles is introduced into a health care facility, it has been my experience that the infection is not recognized promptly to minimize nosocomial spread. - Mod.LL   .

Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world. A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries. Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years. \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\" \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea\". The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years 2 million DALYs since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln 13 million DALYs in the US, and 36-mln 36 million DALYs in Ethiopia. \"Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,\" continues Prof Melegaro \"our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population. Tailoring immunization campaigns to achieve measles eradication goals is essential and currently, for some countries, this means considering also the role of unprotected adolescents and young adults.

WHO risk assessment MERS-CoV causes severe human infections resulting in high mortality and has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings. The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals or animal products (for example, following contact with dromedaries) or human source (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information. WHO advice Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures. Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, in addition to avoiding close contact with suspected or confirmed human cases of the disease, people with these conditions should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp In summary, according to the WHO update, as of Sat 12 Aug 2017, there have been a total of 2066 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported to WHO, including at least 720 related deaths (reported case fatality rate 34.8 percent). In the period covered by the above update (4 Jul - 12 Aug 2017), there were 26 newly confirmed laboratory confirmed infections with the MERS-CoV including 8 asymptomatic infections associated with the outbreak in Dawmet Aljandal (Asir region). In addition to the 6 fatalities among these 26 newly confirmed infections, official recovery reports from the MOH were available for cases no. 1 (on Tue 11 Jul 2017), no. 3 (on Mon 31 Jul 2017), no 5 (on Thu 17 Aug 2017), and no. 9 (Tue 15 Aug 2017). Classifications of the 26 cases reported by the MOH included: A total of 8 primary cases with high risk exposures still under investigation (cases nos. 1, 2, 3, 7, 11, 20, 21, and 26) One primary case with no known high risk exposure (case no. 6) Up to 4 primary cases with contact with camels (3 direct contact, one indirect contact  cases nos. 4, 5, 8 and 12) A total of 8 secondary healthcare associated cases in healthcare workers (cases nos. 10, 15, 16, 17, 22, 23, 24, and 25) One secondary healthcare associated case in a patient (case no.19) Up to 4 secondary cases in household contacts (cases nos. 9, 13, 14 and 18) According to the WHO update, case no. 11 had a history of contact with camels that was not known at the time of the MOH report. Interpretation of the details above is that outside of the outbreak in Asir region, the pattern of transmission was primarily sporadic cases, around the country, the majority of whom were classified as primary cases with unidentified high risk exposures (8 out of 13) and the remaining 5 cases had a history of known contact with camels and camel products in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. So the question remains, what is the high risk exposure that is not being identified? .......- Mod.MPP ","keywordsMatched":[]},"698":{"title":["Saudi Arabia"],"date":["17","August","2017"],"url":"who.int/countries/sau/en","summary":"WHO | Saudi Arabia  Skip to main content  Access  Home Alt+0  Navigation Alt+1  Content Alt+2  Search  Search the  WHO .

In the 11 day period since the last update, there have been 7 newly confirmed cases reported of whom 5 were from Dawmat Aljandal (Al Jawf region), the location that had nosocomial transmission identified since the beginning of this past month July 2017. Clearly transmission is continuing in this area, with 3 newly confirmed secondary cases in household contacts - at least 2 of whom were identified through screening of asymptomatic household contacts, and 2 additional cases in which high risk exposures are still under investigation. We do not know if these household contacts are associated with the earlier identified transmission chain in Dawmat Aljandal or if these are newly identified chains of transmission. The other 2 newly confirmed cases involve \"sporadic\" cases - an individual in Hail whose high risk exposure history is still under investigation, and an individual from Alaflaj (Riyadh region) with a history of direct contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. As to be expected, concern is being voiced on the international level with the upcoming Hajj and this recent increase in cases reported both in Saudi Arabia and in the UAE. We now have gone through 5 Hajj periods since the identification of the MERS-CoV and to date there have been no cases of MERS-CoV infection identified in returning Hajjis. The case in the UAE (see section 1 above) actually had onset of illness over 1 month ago with no secondary cases/infections identified among known contacts of this case. As for the cases in Saudi Arabia, and more specifically the Hajj, population movement is very well defined during the Hajj, no camels are permitted in the areas where Hajjis are congregated, and there are Hajj specific health services that are separate from those that are available for the general Saudi population, all factors that are reducing the likelihood of Hajjis having inadvertent (or intentional) high risk exposures. Hopefully my optimism is well placed and we will pass through a 6th Hajj period without impact on international transmission of the MERS-CoV associated with this Hajj. - Mod.MPP ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Senegal":{"62":{"title":"Zika virus (16): Americas, Asia, research,\r\n\tobservations ","date":["17","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Zika virus (16): Americas, Asia, research,\r\n\tobservations [EXTERNAL]","summary":" 11 _Culex quinquefasciatus_ as vectors  Wed 9 Aug 2017 Source: Emerging Microbes & Infections edited ref: Guedes DR, Paiva MH, Donato MM, et al.

Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world. A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries. Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years. \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\" \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea\". The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years 2 million DALYs since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln 13 million DALYs in the US, and 36-mln 36 million DALYs in Ethiopia. \"Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,\" continues Prof Melegaro \"our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population. Tailoring immunization campaigns to achieve measles eradication goals is essential and currently, for some countries, this means considering also the role of unprotected adolescents and young adults.

The 1st 2 cases of cholera were tested positive by National Institute of Health Islamabad on Mon 31 Jul 2017 and another 2 confirmed positive for the infection on Fri 4 Aug 2017. All the 4 patients were undergoing treatment at Benazir Bhutto Hospital BH where as many as 4 more suspects of the infection have been admitted for treatment. Data collected by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017 reveals that the allied hospitals have sent stool samples of over 10 child patients to NIH for confirmation of cholera in last week week of Sun 6 Aug 2017. On Sat 12 Aug 2017, as many as 20 child patients with severe diarrhoea were admitted at the BBH of which 4 were suspected as patients of cholera and their stool samples were sent to NIH for confirmation, said Associate Professor of Paediatrics at Rawalpindi Medical University Dr Tariq Saeed when contacted by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017. He added the hospital has not received confirmation reports from the NIH because of holidays there from Saturday to Monday. However, we have been keeping the suspects in isolation under strict monitoring, he said. He added that repeated rainfalls in the region and water inundation inside and outside homes in a number of localities particularly in thickly populated areas of the city are causing contamination of water and foodstuff that increases chances of spread of a number of infections among population while children are at greater risk of contracting life-threatening infections including cholera. It is important that the transmission of cholera occurs primarily by drinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the feces (waste product) of an infected person, including one with no apparent symptoms. It is observed that heavy rainfall causes collection of heavily contaminated water in streets and houses and the waste water flooding out of various nullahs watercourses including Nullah Leh in town causes infections including cholera, typhoid, dysentery, gastroenteritis, hepatitis A and E, shigellosis and giardiasis. Professor Tariq said the consumption of contaminated water and foodstuff causes cholera, an infection in the small intestine caused by bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. Its main symptoms are watery diarrhea and vomiting that can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, and death in cases which are not treated in time, he said. Health experts say that to avoid cholera and other infections, one must use boiled water for drinking and should use vegetables after washing with clean water and it must be kept in mind that raw vegetables should not be eaten in the existing weather conditions instead these should be used after cooking. To a query, Professor Tariq said the heavy rainfall and water accumulation may contaminate water at sources and there may be chances of contamination of water at tube wells so individuals must boil water before drinking to avoid cholera and other infections. He added the appearance of cholera is alarming and it is time for people to take extra ordinary preventive measures to safeguard their children and themselves from the disease. In case water is accumulated inside home due to heavy rainfall and flooded out of sewage lines, it must be wiped out immediately and the space should be washed with clean water as soon as possible to avoid infections. Avoiding inundation of contaminated water inside homes is a must to avoid cholera and other infections, said Professor Tariq.

The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80 percent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:  - Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_; - Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65 percent (95 percent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam;  - Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however, have suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be effective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and outbreak situations (63, 64).<br><br><strong> \"References </strong><br> 57.

Shipped from Amsterdam to Miami after participating in Sweden and UK An American dressage horse returning to the United States after a competition tour in Europe could be euthanized or shipped back out of the country after testing positive for glanders during routine USDA equine import quarantine. Glanders is a highly contagious upper respiratory disease that can be passed from horse-to-horse as well as to human handlers. Acute clinical signs include fever; cough; difficulty breathing; nasal discharge; swollen and painful submaxillary lymph nodes (the \"glands\" in \"glanders\"); rapidly spreading ulcers on the nasal mucosa, nodules, and chronic abscesses; and small abscesses in the lung and/or abscesses in the liver or spleen, among others. Clinical signs of chronic glanders include coughing; malaise; weight loss; intermittent fever; possible thick nasal discharge, usually out of one nostril; ulcers and nodules on the nasal mucosa; enlarged submaxillary lymph nodes; chronic enlargement and induration (hardening) of lymphatics and lymph nodes; joint swelling and painful leg edema (fluid swelling); and nodules, particularly on the legs, that rupture, release pus, and ulcerate. Glanders has been eradicated from North American and was last reported in the United States in the 1940s. It's recently been reported in several areas around the world, however, including South America, Eastern Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and a rare case in Germany in 2014. Earlier this month August 2017, the 18-year-old Dutch Warmblood gelding Sagacious HF was shipped from Amsterdam to the Miami International Airport after participating in competitions in Sweden and England with Chase Hickok. Under USDA rules, all horses entering the United States, except those coming from Canada, must be quarantined and tested for 4 diseases  dourine, glanders, equine piroplasmosis, and equine infectious anemia  upon arrival. Jeanine Neskey, interim public affairs specialist for the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), said an animal that produces a positive test result is denied entry to the United States. \"Denied entry means that it must be either removed from the U.S. or be euthanized,\" she said. \"If the horse is denied entry into the U.S. (and not euthanized), the owner is free to take the horse to any other country that will accept it.\" Scott Leibsle, DVM, Idaho's deputy state veterinarian, said Sagacious could have contracted the disease through contaminated feed or through water buckets also used by other horses participating in competitions. The gelding might also have been an asymptomatic carrier of the disease, possibly developing signs after experiencing stress \"Transport is the most stressful thing you can do to a horse,\" he said. \"At the same time, you're putting it with new animals in a new area, and putting it under the stress of competition.\" Currently APHIS uses a complement fixation test (CFT) to detect glanders. However, the agency is evaluating other testing methods, including the Western Blot procedure. \"Advancing research and improved technology continue to develop new or improved testing methods for animal diseases,\" Neskey said. \"USDA routinely evaluates all testing methods available and incorporates the methods most appropriate to the needs of import quarantine testing.\" After Sagacious produced a 2nd positive CFT glanders test, he produced a negative Western Blot glanders test. Arrangements were made to place him on extended quarantine pending the results of additional testing with both tests, slated for Wed 23 Aug 2017. Byline: Pat Raia  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail Glanders, also known as farcy, is a contagious infectious disease of equines, acute or chronic, usually fatal, caused by the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_, and characterized by the development of ulcerated nodules that are most commonly found in the upper airway, lungs ,and skin. Felines and other animals are susceptible to infection, which is usually fatal. Humans can be infected and the microorganism (_B. mallei_) is considered a potential bioterrorism agent. The disease, one among the oldest known and that used to be prevalent worldwide, is currently eradicated or effectively controlled in many countries. Recently the disease has been reported in some countries, including Iraq, Turkey, Pakistan, India, Mongolia, China, Brazil, United Arab Emirates, and countries in Africa. Glanders is one of the diseases contained in the list of diseases for mandatory reporting to the World Animal Health Organization (OIE). The bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_ a clonal pathogen, can be found in nasal secretions and skin ulcers of infected animals. The transmission of glanders occurs commonly from intake of water or food contaminated with nasal secretions and exudates eliminated from infected animals, contact with contaminated equipment (saddles, harness) and by eating contaminated equine meat. In the nasal form, nodules arise in septum and turbinates. Nodules progress to irregular edged ulcers; star-shaped scars are characteristic after the resolution of the ulcers. In the early stage, submandibular lymph nodes are enlarged and edematous, adhering to the skin and deep tissues in advanced stages of the disease. In the pulmonary form, inflammatory nodules with caseous or calcified centers are found in the lungs. With the progression of the disease areas of consolidation and pneumonia may be present. The nodules may break and eliminate the inflammatory content into the bronchial tree, spreading the infection to the upper respiratory tract. In the cutaneous form, nodules arise along the lymphatic vessels, especially on the extremities. The nodules may degenerate to form ulcers with drainage of highly infectious purulent material. The liver and spleen may have typical nodular lesions. Histologically, vasculitis, thrombosis, inflammatory cell infiltration and degeneration can be seen. A test based on complement fixation can also be used for screening, but the ELISA test, although more sensitive, is not being routinely used. PCR can be used for specific identification ( ). There are no vaccines. Prevention and control depend on early detection and eliminating infected animals in addition to quarantine and complete disinfection. Treatment, administered only in endemic areas, which does not lead to microbiological cure, is the use of doxycycline, ceftazidime, gentamycin, or streptomycin. Sulfa drugs (including in combination with trimethoprim) seem to be effective in prevention and glanders treatment ( ). For glanders-free countries, there are OIE recommendations on importing equines. An international veterinary certificate is required attesting that the animals showed no clinical signs of glanders and were kept in an exporting country free of the disease for at least 6 months prior to shipment ( ). It appears foreign horse owners will not be able to comply, therefore will be unable to repatriate their show horses? Further information would be welcome. As a horse owner, this would be devastating. We certainly hope Sagacious test later this month August 2017 clears him of this disease. - Mod.TG   .

In Heidelberg a Western Cape town, 3 ostrich farms have tested positive for avian flu. No birds have died on the farms but they remain under quarantine. The 2 farms each have about 1000 ostriches. Van Rhyn said no decision to cull ostriches has been taken yet. She also said chicken in stores was safe for consumption. Bronwynne Jooste, spokesperson for Tourism, Economic Development and Agriculture MEC Alan Winde, said culling of the rest of the chickens and composting of mortalities had already been started. Last week, the department's Veterinary Services programme confirmed the disease had spread to the farm. \"The cause is most likely through contact with wild birds. Since then, meetings with poultry veterinarians and stakeholders such as the National Institute for Communicable Diseases have taken place,\" Jooste said. The farm has been placed under quarantine. She said farms within a 3 km approx 1.8 mi zone of an infected farm would be monitored closely and subjected to the control measures as laid out by the national Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (Daff) \"It is strongly recommended that any movement of pet birds, racing pigeons, breeding birds and show birds be limited as far as possible and covered by a movement permit if coming from within 30 km approx 18 mi of an infected farm,\" said Jooste. Sick or dead birds - both wild birds and poultry - must be reported to local state vets, and exports of poultry and poultry products have been suspended except from poultry compartments registered with Daff, or where a country's import permit contains clauses that are able to be signed by a certifying veterinarian. Winde said the virus presented a challenge to control, but the vets were working hard to contain the spread. \"This is a priority for the poultry industry, and the entire agriculture sector. The outbreak and the current drought have made agriculture a tough space to be in. \"This is a particularly difficult time for those affected farms, which are important employers. This is why we ask all stakeholders to continue working with us to mitigate the impact of this outbreak on our economy,\" Winde said. Avian flu is a viral respiratory disease among birds, believed to be transmitted by wild migratory birds.

Epidemiologically, usually spread by contaminated food or water, typhoid is not a zoonosis like the commoner types of salmonellosis. Clinically, vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent; indeed, constipation is frequently reported. As it is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive. The symptoms of classical typhoid fever typically include fever, anorexia, lethargy, malaise, dull continuous headache, non-productive cough, vague abdominal pain, and constipation. Despite the often high fever, the pulse is often only slightly elevated. During the 2nd week of the illness, there is protracted fever and mental dullness, classically called coma vigil. Diarrhea may develop but usually does not. Many patients develop hepatosplenomegaly both liver and spleen enlarged. After the 1st week or so, many cases develop a maculopapular rash on the upper abdomen. These lesions (\"rose spots\") are about 2 cm 0.78 in in diameter and blanch on pressure. They persist for 2-4 days and may come and go. Mild and atypical infections are common. The word typhoid (as in typhus-like) reflects the similarity of the louseborne rickettsial disease epidemic typhus and that of typhoid fever; in fact, in some areas, typhoid fever is still referred to as abdominal typhus.

A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries. Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years. \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\" \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea\". The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years 2 million DALYs since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln 13 million DALYs in the US, and 36-mln 36 million DALYs in Ethiopia. \"Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,\" continues Prof Melegaro \"our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population. Tailoring immunization campaigns to achieve measles eradication goals is essential and currently, for some countries, this means considering also the role of unprotected adolescents and young adults.

While it is recommended that children get 2 doses of MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine, starting with the 1st dose at 12 through 15 months of age, and the 2nd dose at 4 through 6 years of age, this study emphasizes that it is important that adolescents and young adults also are up to date on their MMR vaccination. - Mod.LK ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"South Sudan":{"48":{"title":"Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (86): Africa,\r\n\tAsia ","date":["18","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (86): Africa,\r\n\tAsia [EXTERNAL]","summary":" 4 Cholera - Pakistan (Punjab Province)  Wed 16 Aug 2017 Source: The News edited The number of cases of cholera, a highly contagious and fatal disease is continuously on the rise and there is a threat that spread of the infection may take shape of an epidemic if proper preventive and control measures are not taken well in time. The 1st 2 cases of cholera were tested positive by National Institute of Health Islamabad on Mon 31 Jul 2017 and another 2 confirmed positive for the infection on Fri 4 Aug 2017. All the 4 patients were undergoing treatment at Benazir Bhutto Hospital BH where as many as 4 more suspects of the infection have been admitted for treatment. Data collected by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017 reveals that the allied hospitals have sent stool samples of over 10 child patients to NIH for confirmation of cholera in last week week of Sun 6 Aug 2017. On Sat 12 Aug 2017, as many as 20 child patients with severe diarrhoea were admitted at the BBH of which 4 were suspected as patients of cholera and their stool samples were sent to NIH for confirmation, said Associate Professor of Paediatrics at Rawalpindi Medical University Dr Tariq Saeed when contacted by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017. He added the hospital has not received confirmation reports from the NIH because of holidays there from Saturday to Monday. However, we have been keeping the suspects in isolation under strict monitoring, he said. He added that repeated rainfalls in the region and water inundation inside and outside homes in a number of localities particularly in thickly populated areas of the city are causing contamination of water and foodstuff that increases chances of spread of a number of infections among population while children are at greater risk of contracting life-threatening infections including cholera. It is important that the transmission of cholera occurs primarily by drinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the feces (waste product) of an infected person, including one with no apparent symptoms. It is observed that heavy rainfall causes collection of heavily contaminated water in streets and houses and the waste water flooding out of various nullahs watercourses including Nullah Leh in town causes infections including cholera, typhoid, dysentery, gastroenteritis, hepatitis A and E, shigellosis and giardiasis. Professor Tariq said the consumption of contaminated water and foodstuff causes cholera, an infection in the small intestine caused by bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. Its main symptoms are watery diarrhea and vomiting that can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, and death in cases which are not treated in time, he said. Health experts say that to avoid cholera and other infections, one must use boiled water for drinking and should use vegetables after washing with clean water and it must be kept in mind that raw vegetables should not be eaten in the existing weather conditions instead these should be used after cooking. To a query, Professor Tariq said the heavy rainfall and water accumulation may contaminate water at sources and there may be chances of contamination of water at tube wells so individuals must boil water before drinking to avoid cholera and other infections. He added the appearance of cholera is alarming and it is time for people to take extra ordinary preventive measures to safeguard their children and themselves from the disease. In case water is accumulated inside home due to heavy rainfall and flooded out of sewage lines, it must be wiped out immediately and the space should be washed with clean water as soon as possible to avoid infections. Avoiding inundation of contaminated water inside homes is a must to avoid cholera and other infections, said Professor Tariq.

Malaria is a life-threatening mosquitoborne blood disease caused by a plasmodium parasite, which is usually transmitted to humans through the bite of the anopheles mosquito. Once an infected mosquito bites a human, the parasites multiply in the host's liver before infecting and destroying red blood cells. According to the senior health official, the country's Epidemic Task Force, headed by the Ministry of Health in partnership with United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and other partners has also stepped up efforts to fight the disease. The health official, however, decried the lack of funds to fight malaria and appealed for donations to help fight the disease. In July 2017, OCHA said more than 76 per cent of disease-related deaths in South Sudan are from malaria. However, the civil war in the country probably means that malaria control activities and probably drug distribution have been impaired, which could be one explanation for the reported outbreak. - Mod.EP   .

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea: \"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per cent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as \"potentially the most important medical advance\" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5). \"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.<br><br><strong> \"References </strong><br> 1.

It is important that the transmission of cholera occurs primarily by drinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the feces (waste product) of an infected person, including one with no apparent symptoms. It is observed that heavy rainfall causes collection of heavily contaminated water in streets and houses and the waste water flooding out of various nullahs watercourses including Nullah Leh in town causes infections including cholera, typhoid, dysentery, gastroenteritis, hepatitis A and E, shigellosis and giardiasis. Professor Tariq said the consumption of contaminated water and foodstuff causes cholera, an infection in the small intestine caused by bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. Its main symptoms are watery diarrhea and vomiting that can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, and death in cases which are not treated in time, he said. Health experts say that to avoid cholera and other infections, one must use boiled water for drinking and should use vegetables after washing with clean water and it must be kept in mind that raw vegetables should not be eaten in the existing weather conditions instead these should be used after cooking. To a query, Professor Tariq said the heavy rainfall and water accumulation may contaminate water at sources and there may be chances of contamination of water at tube wells so individuals must boil water before drinking to avoid cholera and other infections. He added the appearance of cholera is alarming and it is time for people to take extra ordinary preventive measures to safeguard their children and themselves from the disease. In case water is accumulated inside home due to heavy rainfall and flooded out of sewage lines, it must be wiped out immediately and the space should be washed with clean water as soon as possible to avoid infections. Avoiding inundation of contaminated water inside homes is a must to avoid cholera and other infections, said Professor Tariq.

Malaria is a life-threatening mosquitoborne blood disease caused by a plasmodium parasite, which is usually transmitted to humans through the bite of the anopheles mosquito. Once an infected mosquito bites a human, the parasites multiply in the host's liver before infecting and destroying red blood cells. According to the senior health official, the country's Epidemic Task Force, headed by the Ministry of Health in partnership with United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and other partners has also stepped up efforts to fight the disease. The health official, however, decried the lack of funds to fight malaria and appealed for donations to help fight the disease. In July 2017, OCHA said more than 76 per cent of disease-related deaths in South Sudan are from malaria. However, the civil war in the country probably means that malaria control activities and probably drug distribution have been impaired, which could be one explanation for the reported outbreak. - Mod.EP   .

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea: \"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per cent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as \"potentially the most important medical advance\" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5). \"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.<br><br><strong> \"References </strong><br> 1.

Shipped from Amsterdam to Miami after participating in Sweden and UK An American dressage horse returning to the United States after a competition tour in Europe could be euthanized or shipped back out of the country after testing positive for glanders during routine USDA equine import quarantine. Glanders is a highly contagious upper respiratory disease that can be passed from horse-to-horse as well as to human handlers. Acute clinical signs include fever; cough; difficulty breathing; nasal discharge; swollen and painful submaxillary lymph nodes (the \"glands\" in \"glanders\"); rapidly spreading ulcers on the nasal mucosa, nodules, and chronic abscesses; and small abscesses in the lung and/or abscesses in the liver or spleen, among others. Clinical signs of chronic glanders include coughing; malaise; weight loss; intermittent fever; possible thick nasal discharge, usually out of one nostril; ulcers and nodules on the nasal mucosa; enlarged submaxillary lymph nodes; chronic enlargement and induration (hardening) of lymphatics and lymph nodes; joint swelling and painful leg edema (fluid swelling); and nodules, particularly on the legs, that rupture, release pus, and ulcerate. Glanders has been eradicated from North American and was last reported in the United States in the 1940s. It's recently been reported in several areas around the world, however, including South America, Eastern Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and a rare case in Germany in 2014. Earlier this month August 2017, the 18-year-old Dutch Warmblood gelding Sagacious HF was shipped from Amsterdam to the Miami International Airport after participating in competitions in Sweden and England with Chase Hickok. Under USDA rules, all horses entering the United States, except those coming from Canada, must be quarantined and tested for 4 diseases  dourine, glanders, equine piroplasmosis, and equine infectious anemia  upon arrival. Jeanine Neskey, interim public affairs specialist for the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), said an animal that produces a positive test result is denied entry to the United States. \"Denied entry means that it must be either removed from the U.S. or be euthanized,\" she said. \"If the horse is denied entry into the U.S. (and not euthanized), the owner is free to take the horse to any other country that will accept it.\" Scott Leibsle, DVM, Idaho's deputy state veterinarian, said Sagacious could have contracted the disease through contaminated feed or through water buckets also used by other horses participating in competitions. The gelding might also have been an asymptomatic carrier of the disease, possibly developing signs after experiencing stress \"Transport is the most stressful thing you can do to a horse,\" he said. \"At the same time, you're putting it with new animals in a new area, and putting it under the stress of competition.\" Currently APHIS uses a complement fixation test (CFT) to detect glanders. However, the agency is evaluating other testing methods, including the Western Blot procedure. \"Advancing research and improved technology continue to develop new or improved testing methods for animal diseases,\" Neskey said. \"USDA routinely evaluates all testing methods available and incorporates the methods most appropriate to the needs of import quarantine testing.\" After Sagacious produced a 2nd positive CFT glanders test, he produced a negative Western Blot glanders test. Arrangements were made to place him on extended quarantine pending the results of additional testing with both tests, slated for Wed 23 Aug 2017. Byline: Pat Raia  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail Glanders, also known as farcy, is a contagious infectious disease of equines, acute or chronic, usually fatal, caused by the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_, and characterized by the development of ulcerated nodules that are most commonly found in the upper airway, lungs ,and skin. Felines and other animals are susceptible to infection, which is usually fatal. Humans can be infected and the microorganism (_B. mallei_) is considered a potential bioterrorism agent. The disease, one among the oldest known and that used to be prevalent worldwide, is currently eradicated or effectively controlled in many countries. Recently the disease has been reported in some countries, including Iraq, Turkey, Pakistan, India, Mongolia, China, Brazil, United Arab Emirates, and countries in Africa. Glanders is one of the diseases contained in the list of diseases for mandatory reporting to the World Animal Health Organization (OIE). The bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_ a clonal pathogen, can be found in nasal secretions and skin ulcers of infected animals. The transmission of glanders occurs commonly from intake of water or food contaminated with nasal secretions and exudates eliminated from infected animals, contact with contaminated equipment (saddles, harness) and by eating contaminated equine meat. In the nasal form, nodules arise in septum and turbinates. Nodules progress to irregular edged ulcers; star-shaped scars are characteristic after the resolution of the ulcers. In the early stage, submandibular lymph nodes are enlarged and edematous, adhering to the skin and deep tissues in advanced stages of the disease. In the pulmonary form, inflammatory nodules with caseous or calcified centers are found in the lungs. With the progression of the disease areas of consolidation and pneumonia may be present. The nodules may break and eliminate the inflammatory content into the bronchial tree, spreading the infection to the upper respiratory tract. In the cutaneous form, nodules arise along the lymphatic vessels, especially on the extremities. The nodules may degenerate to form ulcers with drainage of highly infectious purulent material. The liver and spleen may have typical nodular lesions. Histologically, vasculitis, thrombosis, inflammatory cell infiltration and degeneration can be seen. A test based on complement fixation can also be used for screening, but the ELISA test, although more sensitive, is not being routinely used. PCR can be used for specific identification ( ). There are no vaccines. Prevention and control depend on early detection and eliminating infected animals in addition to quarantine and complete disinfection. Treatment, administered only in endemic areas, which does not lead to microbiological cure, is the use of doxycycline, ceftazidime, gentamycin, or streptomycin. Sulfa drugs (including in combination with trimethoprim) seem to be effective in prevention and glanders treatment ( ). For glanders-free countries, there are OIE recommendations on importing equines. An international veterinary certificate is required attesting that the animals showed no clinical signs of glanders and were kept in an exporting country free of the disease for at least 6 months prior to shipment ( ). It appears foreign horse owners will not be able to comply, therefore will be unable to repatriate their show horses? Further information would be welcome. As a horse owner, this would be devastating. We certainly hope Sagacious test later this month August 2017 clears him of this disease. - Mod.TG   .

TY  communicated by: ProMED-mail and Roland Hübner Superior Health Council Brussels Belgium The number of reported cases of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection in the Americas appears to have declined this year (2017). Given the outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections in the region, and the clinical similarity of cases of that virus infection and CHIKV infection, one wonders how many cases that were not laboratory confirmed but clinically diagnosed as ZIKV infections were, in reality, CHIKV infections. It is also possible that a significant proportion of the population have been infected by CHIKV in the previous 3 years and are now immune. It seems likely, however, that CHIKV is now endemic in the Americas, and sporadic, small outbreaks may continue to occur as they do in Asia and Africa. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"503":{"title":"Dengue/DHF update (10): Asia, Pacific, Africa, research, WHO\r\n\t","date":["25","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Dengue/DHF update (10): Asia, Pacific, Africa, research, WHO\r\n\t[EXTERNAL]","summary":" 3 WHO update  The 15 Aug 2017 Source: WHO Western Pacific region edited Dengue situation update no.<br><br><strong> 523 - Northern hemisphere -</strong><br> Cambodia As of 8 Aug 2017, a total of 1604 suspected dengue fever cases were reported in 2017.

The 1st 2 cases of cholera were tested positive by National Institute of Health Islamabad on Mon 31 Jul 2017 and another 2 confirmed positive for the infection on Fri 4 Aug 2017. All the 4 patients were undergoing treatment at Benazir Bhutto Hospital BH where as many as 4 more suspects of the infection have been admitted for treatment. Data collected by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017 reveals that the allied hospitals have sent stool samples of over 10 child patients to NIH for confirmation of cholera in last week week of Sun 6 Aug 2017. On Sat 12 Aug 2017, as many as 20 child patients with severe diarrhoea were admitted at the BBH of which 4 were suspected as patients of cholera and their stool samples were sent to NIH for confirmation, said Associate Professor of Paediatrics at Rawalpindi Medical University Dr Tariq Saeed when contacted by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017. He added the hospital has not received confirmation reports from the NIH because of holidays there from Saturday to Monday. However, we have been keeping the suspects in isolation under strict monitoring, he said. He added that repeated rainfalls in the region and water inundation inside and outside homes in a number of localities particularly in thickly populated areas of the city are causing contamination of water and foodstuff that increases chances of spread of a number of infections among population while children are at greater risk of contracting life-threatening infections including cholera. It is important that the transmission of cholera occurs primarily by drinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the feces (waste product) of an infected person, including one with no apparent symptoms. It is observed that heavy rainfall causes collection of heavily contaminated water in streets and houses and the waste water flooding out of various nullahs watercourses including Nullah Leh in town causes infections including cholera, typhoid, dysentery, gastroenteritis, hepatitis A and E, shigellosis and giardiasis. Professor Tariq said the consumption of contaminated water and foodstuff causes cholera, an infection in the small intestine caused by bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. Its main symptoms are watery diarrhea and vomiting that can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, and death in cases which are not treated in time, he said. Health experts say that to avoid cholera and other infections, one must use boiled water for drinking and should use vegetables after washing with clean water and it must be kept in mind that raw vegetables should not be eaten in the existing weather conditions instead these should be used after cooking. To a query, Professor Tariq said the heavy rainfall and water accumulation may contaminate water at sources and there may be chances of contamination of water at tube wells so individuals must boil water before drinking to avoid cholera and other infections. He added the appearance of cholera is alarming and it is time for people to take extra ordinary preventive measures to safeguard their children and themselves from the disease. In case water is accumulated inside home due to heavy rainfall and flooded out of sewage lines, it must be wiped out immediately and the space should be washed with clean water as soon as possible to avoid infections. Avoiding inundation of contaminated water inside homes is a must to avoid cholera and other infections, said Professor Tariq. Byline: Muhammad Qasim  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-SoAs Aggressive interventions to stem outbreaks of cholera include providing sources of clean water and a vaccination campaign. The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80 percent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:  - Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_; - Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65 percent (95 percent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam;  - Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however, have suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be effective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and outbreak situations (63, 64).<br><br><strong> \"References </strong><br> 57.

The disease, caused by the bacterium _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ and prevalent during the rainy season in the subtropics, peaks every August in Thailand and has been wider spread this year 2017, he said. \"The bacterium thrives in contaminated water and soil and infects humans and animals through direct contact. People could get infected from prolonged exposure to contaminated water or soil, especially if they have any open sores or lesions in the skin,\" Jessada said. \"Infection can also come from consuming contaminated water or food.\" Melioidosis produces a variety of acute and severe symptoms, he said, including long-lasting fever with no other apparent cause, ulcers or abscesses in the lungs, liver or spleen, and blood infections. The disease, which mainly affects adults, can be fatal, he said. Death has been known to result within 2-3 days of admission to hospital. Risk factors for infection include chronic respiratory and lung disease, tuberculosis, diabetes, chronic renal disease, thalassemia, cancer, and immune-suppressing conditions unrelated to HIV. Jessada advised people coming into regular contact with floodwater to wear boots, drink only water that has been boiled, avoid raw and partially cooked food, wash immediately after exposure and seek medical attention if a fever persists for more than 5 days or abscesses become chronic.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Melioidosis is a disease of the rainy season in its endemic areas. It mainly affects people who have direct contact with soil and water. Many have an underlying predisposing condition such as diabetes (commonest risk factor), renal disease, cirrhosis, thalassemia, alcohol dependence, immunosuppressive therapy, chronic obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and excess kava consumption. Kava is an herbal member of the pepper family that can be associated with chronic liver disease. Melioidosis may present at any age, but peaks in the 4th and 5th decades of life, affecting men more than women. In addition, although severe fulminating infection can and does occur in healthy individuals, severe disease and fatalities are much less common in those without risk factors. The most commonly recognized presentation of melioidosis is pneumonia, associated with high fever, significant muscle aches, chest pain, and  although the cough can be nonproductive  respiratory secretions can be purulent, significant in quantity, and associated with on-and-off bright, red blood. The lung infection can be rapidly fatal  with bacteremia and shock  or somewhat more indolent. Acute melioidosis septicemia is the most severe complication of the infection. It presents as a typical sepsis syndrome with hypotension, high cardiac output, and low systemic vascular resistance. In many cases, a primary focus in the soft tissues or lung can be found. The syndrome, usually in patients with risk factor comorbidities, is characteristically associated with multiple abscesses involving the cutaneous tissues, the lung, the liver, and spleen, and a very high mortality rate of 80 to 95 percent. With prompt optimal therapy, the case fatality rate can be decreased to 40 to 50 percent. The melioidosis bacillus is intrinsically insensitive to many antimicrobials. It should be noted that bioterrorism strains may be engineered to be even more resistant. _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ is usually inhibited by tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT), antipseudomonal penicillins, carbapenems, ceftazidime, and amoxicillin/clavulanate or ampicillin/sulbactam. Ceftriaxone and cefotaxime have good in vitro activity but poor efficacy; and cefepime did not appear, as well, to be equivalent to ceftazidime in a mouse model. The unusual antimicrobial profile of resistance to colistin and polymyxin B and the aminoglycosides but sensitivity to amoxicillin/clavulanate is a useful tool to consider in treatment of infection with the organism. The randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing melioidosis treatment have been reviewed, and it was found that the formerly standard therapy of chloramphenicol, doxycycline, and SXT combination had a higher mortality rate than therapy with ceftazidime, imipenem/cilastatin, or amoxicillin/clavulanate (or ampicillin/sulbactam). The betalactam-betalactamase inhibitor therapy, however, seemed to have a higher failure rate. Source: Tolaney P, Lutwick LI: Melioidosis. In: Lutwick LI, Lutwick SM (eds).

On 20 Aug 2017, the ministry received blood samples of 2 patients from Kiboga and Nakaseke hospital suspected Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF). According to a 21 Aug 2017 statement signed by the acting Director General, health services Dr Anthony Mbonye, the 2 victims tested positive to Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever CCFH. CCHF is a common disease among humans and animals caused by caused by a tick-borne virus (_Nairovirus_); the virus causes severe viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 percent. Dr Mbonye says that the general supportive care with treatment of symptoms is the main approach to managing CCFH among humans. The statement warns that while its symptoms do not appear in the infected animal, it appears in a very dangerous way in human beings. \"You are required to work with the office of the District Veterinary Officer to strengthen measures against CCHF control in animals, implement interventions to reduce the risk of CCHF infections among humans, and interventions to control CCFH in health care settings. You are also reminded to immediately report and investigate any CCFH suspected cases in your district,\" reads the statement in part signed by Dr Mbonye. CCHF virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. According to Ministry of health, the majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians and that human-to-human transmission occurs from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of infected persons. Hospital-acquired infections can also occur due to improper sterilization of medical equipment, reuse of needles, and contamination of medical supplies. Records indicate that since 2000, Uganda has experienced repeated outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF). Ebola VHF outbreak occurred in the districts of Gulu in 2000, Bundibugyo, 2007, Luwero, 2011, Kibaale in July 2012, Luwero in November 2012. Marburg VHF was earlier reported in Ibanda in 2007.

CCHF is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and Asian countries south of the 50th parallel north  the geographical limit of the principal tick vector. The hosts of the CCHF virus include a wide range of wild and domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats. Animals become infected by the bite of infected ticks and the virus remains in their bloodstream for about one week after infection, allowing the tick-animal-tick cycle to continue when another tick bites. Although a number of tick genera are capable of becoming infected with CCHF virus, ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_ are the principal vector. The CCHF virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Human-to-human transmission is possible.

As to be expected, concern is being voiced on the international level with the upcoming Hajj and this recent increase in cases reported both in Saudi Arabia and in the UAE. We now have gone through 5 Hajj periods since the identification of the MERS-CoV and to date there have been no cases of MERS-CoV infection identified in returning Hajjis. The case in the UAE (see section 1 above) actually had onset of illness over 1 month ago with no secondary cases/infections identified among known contacts of this case. As for the cases in Saudi Arabia, and more specifically the Hajj, population movement is very well defined during the Hajj, no camels are permitted in the areas where Hajjis are congregated, and there are Hajj specific health services that are separate from those that are available for the general Saudi population, all factors that are reducing the likelihood of Hajjis having inadvertent (or intentional) high risk exposures. Hopefully my optimism is well placed and we will pass through a 6th Hajj period without impact on international transmission of the MERS-CoV associated with this Hajj. - Mod.MPP ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"United Kingdom":{"188":{"title":"Foot & mouth disease - Nepal: (CH) bovine, new, st A, gt VII,\r\n\tOIE ","date":["23","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH> Foot & mouth disease - Nepal: (CH) bovine, new, st A, gt VII,\r\n\tOIE [EXTERNAL]","summary":"Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter Epidemiology Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive, Illegal movement of animals Epidemiological comments: 15 per cent of young (1-1.5 years old) and 85 per cent of adult (3-5 years old) cross breed cattle and buffaloes of 4 farms were affected with typical signs and symptoms of foot and mouth disease (FMD) such as high fever, drooling of saliva, champing of jaws, lameness, off feed, lesions on tongue.

For the said and additional information on Nepal's FMD past records, including genotyping results (though not yet of the newly introduced A/ASIA/G-VII lineage), see  . The identification of the A/ASIA/G-VII lineage in Nepal represents further spread of this virus, which had been evolving in India many years back (\"A/IND/40/2000\", genotyped A/ASIA/G-VII, was collected in 1999).

Emerg Microbes Infect. 2017; 6(8): e69. doi: 10.1038/emi.2017.<br><br><strong>59  Abstract </strong><br> Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has recently been associated with an increased incidence of neonatal microcephaly and other neurological disorders. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito bite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some cases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main vector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other mosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the virus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit ZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of laboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. Interestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the midgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in Recife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially fed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx. quinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced. Collectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range of ZIKV vectors than anticipated.  <br><br>Communicated by: Roland Hübner Superior Health Council Brussels Belgium Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active virus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their ability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step toward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_ fed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in saliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing. The study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a competent vector. Several other studies have shown this species to be inefficient vectors or refractory to Zika virus infection. One wonders if the specific _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ used or the Zika virus isolates with which they were tested could account for these very different results. Resolving these discrepancies is important because this mosquito species is very widely distributed around the world and bears directly on risk of outbreaks in geographic areas where _Aedes aegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_ , Zika virus vectors, do not occur. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"749":{"title":"Zika virus (17): Americas, research, observations ","date":["24","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Zika virus (17): Americas, research, observations [EXTERNAL]","summary":" 6 Vaccine update  22/29 Aug 2017 Source: Journal of the American Medical Association, JAMA edited ref: Lyon J.

Multiple candidate Zika vaccines have been shown protective against infection with the virus in animal studies, with several now in human trials, but none were tested in the context of pregnancy, according to the authors of the study published in Cell  . The 2 vaccine candidates investigated in the new study are the 1st to demonstrate efficacy in preventing vertical transmission of the virus and related fetal death in an animal model. Although the vaccines were administered to female mice prior to pregnancy, the result is considered an important step toward developing a vaccine that could be safely given to pregnant women. One of the 2 candidates is a modified messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine encoding Zika genes, developed by the biotechnology company Moderna. It is already in safety trials in women who are not pregnant. The other is a live-attenuated Zika strain developed by researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). The testing was carried out by scientists from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Washington University School of Medicine, and UTMB. The researchers 1st vaccinated the mice with 1 of the vaccines or a placebo. After mating, the animals were challenged with the virus 6 days into pregnancy. A week later, more than 50 percent of placentas and fetuses from mice administered the mRNA vaccine had virtually no Zika RNA. The remainder had \"substantially lower\" levels relative to placebo. The live vaccine provided broader protection: 78 percent of placentas and 83 percent of fetuses had Zika RNA at or below the level of detection, while the placebo group exhibited significantly higher levels of placental and fetal Zika RNA. Mice vaccinated with either vaccine had significantly higher rates of fetal viability; whereas 100 percent of fetuses from mice vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine were born, none survived to term in the placebo group. A working group funded by the Wellcome Trust recently approved ethical guidelines for testing such vaccines in pregnant women, normally excluded from drug trials.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. It is reassuring to learn that at least 2 vaccines are now entering clinical trials in women. Although anti-Zika virus drugs are under development, preventing infection through vaccination seems to be the most effective measure to prevent fetal infection and adverse effects of the virus infection in adults. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Uruguay":{},"Uzbekistan":{},"Vanuatu":{},"Venezuela":{},"Vietnam":{"651":{"title":["Dengue in Vietnam"],"date":["24","August","2017"],"url":"wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/watch/dengue-vietnam","summary":" Magill Partners GeoSentinel Global TravEpiNet Mobile Apps RSS Feeds  Dengue in Vietnam  Recommend on Facebook  Tweet  Share Compartir  Warning - Level 3, Avoid Nonessential Travel  Alert - Level 2, Practice Enhanced Precautions  Watch - Level 1, Practice Usual Precautions  What is the current situation?  Recently, there has been a large increase in the number of dengue cases in Vietnam, according to a World Health Organization (WHO) report. As of August 2017, more than 80,000 cases have been reported. Although most cases have been reported in the south, there has been a sharp increase in cases in the north, especially in Hanoi.  Dengue is spread through mosquito bites and can cause symptoms such as fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, rash, and pain in the eyes, joints, and muscles.  What can travelers do to prevent dengue?  Because mosquitoes transmit dengue to people, travelers to Vietnam should protect themselves against mosquito bites to avoid getting the illness. There is no vaccine or medicine currently available in the United States to prevent or treat dengue.

The reported numbers affirm a total of 1997 deaths starting from the end of April 2017. As of Saturday evening 19 Aug 2017, the number of cholera cases stands at 527 000. The WHO report also noted that Yemen's Sanaa and Al Hudaydah governorate, located in the west of the country, have the highest rates of cholera spread compared with other governorates. The combined number of infected individuals in the two areas stands at 62 000. The Hajjah governorate has maintained the highest number of cholera related deaths reported at 381. Meanwhile, the United Nations has raised the Humanitarian Response Plan budget to address the Yemeni crisis. The new budget is placed at USD 370 million. Despite the critical situation in Yemen and the spread of cholera, the international organization said that only 33 per cent of the required funds have been provided by donors, most notably Saudi Arabia.  communicated by: ProMED-mail Although a number of sources had reported decreasing numbers of daily cases, the new numbers seem to support the continuing robust number of daily cases.

In a statement, the WHO said 565 041 suspected cases of cholera have been recorded in the country since 27 Apr 2017. According to the WHO statement, the recorded suspected cases were in 22 out of 23 provinces. The UN agency said the highest number of fatalities, 382 cases, was recorded in the northwestern Hajjah province, while in western Yemen's Hudaida province only around 70 000 suspected cases were recorded. Impoverished Yemen has remained in a state of civil war since 2014, when Houthi rebels overran much of the country, including the capital Sanaa. The conflict escalated when Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies launched a massive air campaign in 2015 aimed at reversing Houthi military gains and shoring up Yemen's embattled government. According to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), over 3 million people have fled their homes since the onset of the Yemen conflict, and more than 20 million throughout the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
