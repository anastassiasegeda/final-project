The meeting was attended by the national teams as well as the staff from the southern region of Afghanistan and Balochistan province of Pakistan.  - Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: Pakistan: 2 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) environmental positive samples; Syria: 6 new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases; and, DR Congo: 1 new cVDPV2 case. Additionally, pre-notification was received this week of a new WPV1 case from Karachi, Pakistan, the 1st in Karachi since January 2016. The case will be officially reflected in next week's global data reporting.  Afghanistan  - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 6. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 10 Jul 2017, from Zabul province, neighbouring Kandahar province and Pakistan. - Preparations continue for a targeted vaccination round in the southern region of the country, scheduled on 11 Sep 2017  Pakistan  - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week; the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 3. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 11 Jun 2017, from Killa Abdullah, Balochistan. - Two new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) environmental positive samples were reported in the past week, from Karachi, Sindh (collected on 7 and 12 Aug 2017). - Additionally, pre-notification was received this week of a new WPV1 case from Karachi, Pakistan. The case will be officially reflected in next week's global data reporting. Karachi had previously been a key reservoir for WPV1 in Pakistan. Analysis is ongoing to determine the origin of this latest case and a response is being planned. The case had onset of paralysis on 11 Aug 2017. The last previous case from Karachi is from January 2016. - The National Task Force for Polio Eradication convened last week, chaired by the Prime Minister of Pakistan and attended by the senior leadership from the national and provincial levels. The Task force reviewed the revised National Emergency Action Plan 2017/18 and discussed mechanisms of accelerating the implementation of strategies to stop WPV1 transmission in the key hot spots. - Under the National Emergency Action Plan for polio eradication, the country is planning to implement 2 nation-wide and 2 sub-national vaccination rounds from September to December 2017.  Nigeria - - No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 21 Aug 2016 in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno. - Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and cVDPV2 strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016). - Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance.  Lake Chad Basin  - The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno, Nigeria in 2016) and cVDPV2 (Borno and Sokoto provinces in Nigeria in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak. - Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.  Central Africa  - One new case of cVDPV2 was reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), from Haut Lomami province, with onset of paralysis on 20 Jun 2017. The total number of cVDPV2 cases this year 2017 is now 8, in 2 separate outbreaks: in Haut Lomami province (6 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on 20 Jun 2017); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on 26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017, with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May 2017). - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time. Outbreak response is taking place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols, targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 across the 2 provinces. \n- The 1st mOPV2 round was implemented on 27-29 Jun 2017 in the 2 affected provinces; and the 2nd mOPV2 round ran from 13-15 Jul 2017 in Haut Lomami and 20-22 Jul 2017 in Maniema. - Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.  Middle East  - In Syria, 6 new cases of cVDPV2 were officially reported in the past week from Deir-Ez-Zour governorate, bringing the total number of cases in this outbreak to 39. Onset of paralysis of these cases is between 3 Mar 2017 and 10 Jul 2017. The bulk of all cases are from Deir-Ez-Zour, the epicentre of this outbreak. - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized and implemented, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Two vaccination campaigns are planned for both Deir-Ez-Zour and Raqqa governorates. - The 1st mOPV2 round in Deir-Ez-Zour was successfully carried out between 22-26 Jul 2017. Independent post-campaign monitoring reflected coverage of 88.4 percent (based on caregiver recall). - The 2nd immunization round for Deir-Ez-Zor governorate started on 22 Aug 2017 and is ongoing. Monovalent OPV2 is being provided for children between 0-59 months of age, and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) for children 2-23 months. In addition to polio vaccines, Aqua Tabs are being provided to families for water purification - 2.5 tons of water purification tablets for 400 000 people have been disseminated at health centers. - Plans are being finalized to mitigate the risks of further spread from the outbreak zone to neighbouring areas and countries, including immunization of at-risk populations in northwest Syria, Turkey and Lebanon.

All confirmed cases to date have had onset of paralysis before 14 Jul 2017. - Final lab results are pending for an additional 5 poliovirus type-2 (PV2) isolates (3 from Mayadeen and 1 from Boukamal districts, Deir Ez-Zor governorate, and 1 from Thawra district, Raqqa governorate). - The 2nd immunization round for Deir Ez-Zor started on 22 Aug 2017 and is ongoing due to high levels of population movement in and out of the governorate during the round. - WHO has organized the redistribution of vaccines and mapping of population movements to increase reach. An additional 90 000 mOPV2 doses are being transported from Damascus to Deir Ez-Zor, to cater for population influxes from As-Sukhnah, Homs governorate, and Al-Qa'im in Iraq. Corrective measures are expected to extend the round by 2 days. - Preparations for the 2nd immunization round for Raqqa are underway. - The total number of AFP cases detected in Deir Ez-Zor governorate since the beginning of 2017 is 122 (91 from Mayadeen, 10 from Deir Ez-Zor, and 21 from Boukamal districts). Raqqa governorate has reported 16 AFP cases (5 from Raqqa, 10 from Tell Abyad, and 1 from Thawra districts). Homs governorate has reported 28 AFP cases (12 from Homs city, 13 from Rastan, 1 from Tadmour and 2 from Talkalakh districts).  more details on the vaccination activities and future plans are available at the source URL as well as the epidemic curve and graphic representation of the vaccination status of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis cases by governorate and district. - Mod.MPP   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  In the above global summary, there is still identified transmission ongoing in Pakistan as seen by the positive environmental sample in Karachi as well as the early report on a case of WPV1 associated disease in Karachi. It will be interesting to learn of the genetic profile of the environmental isolates in Karachi (from this past week as well as from a few weeks ago) and compare them with the newly identified WPV1 associated case in Karachi to see if they are genetically related.  There has been more activity associated with cVDPV2 in both Syria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), with 6 newly confirmed cases in Syria and 1 newly confirmed case in the DR Congo. According to the Situation Report in section <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> above, there are still 5 additional PV2 (poliovirus type 2) isolates in Syria undergoing final testing  4 from Deir al Zour and 1 from Raqqa. Hence there will probably be more cases confirmed in the coming days or weeks. I have not been able to identify similar report information from the DR Congo outbreak so it is not clear if the transmission has been interrupted leaving a total of 8 cases, or if there are still probable cases pending confirmation.

Source: Pajhwok Afghan News (edited) (https://www.pajhwok.com/en/2017/08/28/congo-virus-kills-13-infects-42-herat)   Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has killed 13 people in western Herat province this year 2017, with another 42 being treated for the deadly virus, according to officials.  CCHF is a viral disease. Symptoms may include fever, muscle pains, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding into the skin. The CCHF virus is typically spread by tick bites or contact with livestock carrying the disease.  Health officials in Herat advised people to be careful these days due to increased interaction with livestock in the wake of Eidul Adha Sacrifice Feast; 31 Aug-4 Sep 2017, when Muslims across the globe slaughter millions of animals.  Public health director in Herat Abdul Hakim Tamana said many people lost their lives to the Congo virus in the province this year 2017. He said 55 Congo cases were registered in the civil hospital since late March and of the patients, 13 had died. The deceased included 7 men and 6 women, he added.  Tamana said the virus spread from animals and people slaughtering animals should wear gloves.  A livestock farmer, who has contracted Congo virus, said: \"When I slaughtered the sheep, its blood covered my hands and later I started falling sick.\"  Ahmad Khalil Waez, animal healthcare director, said citizens should be careful while slaughtering animals to avoid contracting the Congo virus. He said a butcher should used special glasses, coat, gloves, mask, and shoes while slaughtering the animal.  People mainly contract the CCHF virus from infected ticks or contact with infected animal blood and tissue.  There are no vaccines available to immunize animals but precautionary measures include disinfection of livestock pens, submerging livestock in solutions for decontamination, and meat packaging safeguards.  The virus has had a presence in neighbouring Iran where the virus killed 3 people in 2015.  According to the World Health Organization, CCHF's mortality rate is about 30 percent and is endemic to Africa, the Balkans and Ukraine, the Middle East, and Central Asia.  CCHF was first detected in the Crimea in 1944 and then in the Congo in 1969. In 2011, it was detected for the first time in ticks in Spain.  Byline: Storai Karimi   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  In 2008, a major outbreak was reported in Herat City, western Afghanistan, with approximately 60 suspected and 6 confirmed cases. Later, a cross-sectional seroprevalence survey was conducted among livestock-owning households in the same districts of Herat City where the outbreak had occurred, which showed that IgG seroprevalence was 11.2 and 75.0 percent in humans (n = 330) and livestock (n = 132), respectively ((https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3310665/)).  In 2016, 66 cases had been reported by 7 Sep, with 12 deaths ((http://www.emro.who.int/afg/afghanistan-news/cchf-eid.html)). CCHF virus has been observed in over 30 countries, including in Africa (Democratic Republic of Congo, South Africa, Nigeria, Senegal, Uganda, Tanzania, Mauritania, Kenya), Asia (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, China), the Middle East (Iran, Iraq, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman), and southeastern Europe (the Russian Federation, Bulgaria, Albania, Kosovo, Turkey, Greece, and Spain) ((https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23458713)).  People most at risk of contracting CCHF include animal herders, livestock workers, butchers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Healthcare workers are also at risk of infection through unprotected contact with infectious blood and body fluids while caring for patients. There is no vaccine available for either people or animals, which means prevention is crucial. - Mod.UBA  Maps of Afghanistan can be seen at (http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/afghanistan_admin-2009.jpg) and (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1757). - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ  ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Albania":{},"Algeria":{},"American Samoa":{},"Andorra":{},"Angola":{},"Antigua and Barbuda":{},"Argentina":{},"Armenia":{},"Aruba":{},"Australia":{"114":{"title":"Measles update (43): Asia and Pacific, Europe, demographics\r\n\t","date":["26","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Measles update (43): Asia and Pacific, Europe, demographics\r\n\t[EXTERNAL]","summary":" A ProMED-mail post (http://www.promedmail.org) ProMED-mail is a program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases (http://www.isid.org)  In this update: Asia and Pacific  <br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Japan: travel alert <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Australia (Perth, Western Australia): ex Italy  Europe  <br><br><strong>{3}</strong> Germany (Berlin): 2014-15 <br><br><strong>{4}</strong> Romania  Measles immunity gaps  <br><br><strong>{5}</strong> Role of demographics   Asia and Pacific  <br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Japan: travel alert.

The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare is advising tourists to go to hospital if they develop a high fever or generalized rash after returning to Japan.  Although the World Health Organization verified that Japan has eliminated infections of endemic measles strains in 2015, group infections originating from people who contracted the disease abroad are spreading in the country. As of 6 Aug 2017, the number of patients reached 169 this year in Japan, already eclipsing the figure in the previous year.  About 4100 patients in Italy and around 6500 patients in Romania have already been confirmed as of August 2017 compared with about 860 and 2000, respectively, throughout 2016, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.  Symptoms of the highly contagious disease include runny nose, red and watery eyes, high fever, and rash. The virus is spread through coughing and sneezing and can cause complications such as pneumonia and can even result in death in one in 1000 patients, according to the ministry. The ministry recommends people traveling overseas to check their vaccination records and take an additional shot if they have only been vaccinated once.  The disease was prevalent about a decade ago in Japan with the number of patients soaring to over 10 000 in 2008 but the country was later considered as free from infections of the virus.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Japan can be found at (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/156). - Mod.LK   <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Australia (Perth, Western Australia): ex Italy.

Large measles outbreak introduced by asylum seekers and spread among the insufficiently vaccinated resident population, Berlin, October 2014 to August 2015. Euro Surveill. 2017; 22(34): pii=30599 - Abstract  The largest measles outbreak in Berlin since 2001 occurred from October 2014 to August 2015. Overall, 1344 cases were ascertained, 86 per cent (with available information) unvaccinated, including 146 (12 per cent) asylum seekers. Median age was 17 years (interquartile range: 4-29 years), 26 per cent were hospitalised and a 1 year old child died. Measles virus genotyping uniformly revealed the variant 'D8-Rostov-Don' and descendants. The virus was likely introduced by and initially spread among asylum seekers before affecting Berlin's resident population. Among Berlin residents, the highest incidence was in children younger than 2 years, yet most cases (52 per cent) were adults. Post-exposure vaccinations in homes for asylum seekers, not always conducted, occurred later (median: 7.5 days) than the recommended 72 hours after onset of the 1st case and reached only half of potential contacts. Asylum seekers should not only have non-discriminatory, equitable access to vaccination, they also need to be offered measles vaccination in a timely fashion, that is, immediately upon arrival in the receiving country. Supplementary immunisation activities targeting the resident population, particularly adults, are urgently needed in Berlin.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail.

Source: Romania Insider (edited) (https://www.romania-insider.com/measles-kills-iraqi-refugee/)   The ongoing measles outbreak keeps making victims in Romania. A 10 month old girl, who was a refugee from Iraq, became the 33rd person to die of the infection, reports local Digi24. The girl arrived in Romania on 7 Jul 2017 with her family, and the doctors diagnosed her with measles in August. They also discovered that the child was suffering from malnutrition and severe psychomotor retardation.  The measles outbreak is still a major problem in Romania, with more than 8900 cases reported across the country until 25 Aug 2017, including 33 deaths, according to data from the National Center for Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases (CNSCBT). Most deaths were registered in Timis (9), Dolj (7), and Arad (6) counties.  Measles is a highly contagious respiratory infection caused by a virus. It causes a total-body skin rash and flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough, and runny nose. According to information posted on WHO's website, the virus is highly contagious, spreading by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact, and direct contact with infected nasal or throat secretions. Unvaccinated young children pose the highest risk of measles and its complications, including death.  The Romanian Government adopted earlier this month August 2017 a draft bill on the organization and financing of population vaccination (https://www.romania-insider.com/romania-draft-bill-vaccination/). The project was sent to the Parliament for approval and could come into force in January 2018.  byline: Irina Marica   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Measles tends to be more severe in children who are malnourished, especially children who are also vitamin A deficient. And complications are commoner and more serious in malnourished children. Because of complications such as diarrhoea, measles may lead to failure to thrive. Infection with measles virus may lead to kwashiorkor or marasmus in children who are underweight at the time that they get infected. Therefore, measles may result in, or aggravate, malnutrition.

Date: Sat 26 Aug 2017. Source: News-Medical/Life Sciences (edited) (https://www.news-medical.net/news/20170826/New-study-highlights-role-played-by-demographics-in-the-spread-of-measles.aspx)   Even if the incidence of measles infection has decreased by at least 90 per cent worldwide since the introduction of the vaccine, measles is still one of the major causes of death in children among vaccine-preventable diseases. Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world.  A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries.  Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years.  \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\"  \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea\".  The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years 2 million DALYs since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln 13 million DALYs in the US, and 36-mln 36 million DALYs in Ethiopia.  \"Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,\" continues Prof Melegaro \"our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population. Tailoring immunization campaigns to achieve measles eradication goals is essential and currently, for some countries, this means considering also the role of unprotected adolescents and young adults.\"   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Reference - Trentini F, Poletti P, Merler S, Melegaro A.

This came about after 2\nkidney recipients in Taiwan were diagnosed with dengue 2 days after\nreceiving a kidney each from the same donor, said National Cheng Kung\nUniversity microbiology and immunology professor Dr Oscar Perng\nGuey-chuen. \"This indicates a potential risk,\" the Taiwan-based\nscientist said, adding that no dengue virus was detected in the\ndonor's blood. He said the donor contracted dengue in 2015 and in mid-2016, he died\nin an accident. His family donated his corneas, liver, heart, and\nkidneys. Both patients had the same strain of the dengue virus the\ndonor had in 2015 and one of the recipients died of dengue\nhaemorrhagic fever, he said. Asked where the virus could be hiding since it could not be detected\nin the blood, he said it was a question scientists are trying to\nanswer. Interestingly, those who received the donor's corneas, liver,\nand heart did not develop dengue, Dr Perng said on the sidelines of\nthe National Dengue And Arboviruses Infection Conference 2017\nyesterday 12 Aug 2017. He said although there was not enough\nevidence to show the virus came from the donor as the kidneys were not\ntested for dengue before the transplant, the same virus was found in\nthe patients' bodies after that. Dr Perng said his team had studied mice for dengue virus in the blood\ntestes, kidney, liver, spleen and brain, and found the virus present\nin the kidneys and brain. \"We believe the virus probably resided in\nthe kidneys and was not cleared by the body,\" he said, adding that the\nvirus could have been activated after transplant. He said this raised\nconcerns about asymptomatic people who are dengue carriers. Health Ministry deputy director, general Datuk Dr S Jeyaindran said\npatients with severe dengue would have better recovery if they were\ngiven colloids, a more concentrated fluid, at the early stage in fluid\nmanagement for dengue patients. Dr Jeyaindran, who was representing\nHealth Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam, said colloids may be\nintroduced at an earlier stage, instead of saline because it has not\nbeen successful in treating patients with severe dengue. He said more\nstudies will be conducted to find out at which stage the colloids\nshould be given. byline: Loh Foon Fong \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) - Air travel related spread of dengue.\nDate: Thu 3 Aug 2017.\nSource: Medical Xpress (edited)\n(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-08-air-responsible-dengue-asia.html) \nWhile the incidences of many other infectious diseases have declined\nover the past decade, the number of cases and outbreaks of dengue\nvirus have continued to increase. The spread of dengue to new areas is\nlikely due in large part to trends in air travel, researchers now\nreport in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Dengue virus affects as estimated 390 million people around the globe\neach year, and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild fever and\nheadache to severe low blood pressure. The virus has mostly caused\ndisease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, but a 2014\noutbreak in Japan broke that pattern. Overall, the geographic area\naffected by dengue has been growing in recent years. In the new work, Huaiyu Tian and Bing Xu, both of Beijing Normal\nUniversity, China, together with colleagues from the University of\nOxford and elsewhere analyzed the spread of dengue viruses in Asia\nfrom 1956 to 2015. They used 2202 genetic sequences of dengue viruses,\ncollected in 20 countries or regions of Asia over the 59 years, to\ndetermine how different strains were related. They also investigated\ntrends in air travel, maritime mobility, migration, and\nsocio-economics to determine what factors impact the spread of\ndengue. The spread of 3 different dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1, -2, and -3,\nis associated with air traffic more so than any other factors, the\ndata revealed. Air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India, the\nresearchers found, help seed dengue epidemics, while China, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, and Singapore help diffuse the virus to other Asian\ncountries. \"Future trends in global mobility could potentially accelerate the\nappearance and diffusion of DENV worldwide,\" the researchers say.\n\"Prevention and control of dengue epidemics requires a better\nunderstanding of its mode of geographic dissemination, especially for\ncountries in the tropics.\" Reference: Tian H, Sun Z, Faria NR, et al.

Source: Farm Online (edited) (http://www.farmonline.com.au/story/4875310/fungal-disease-reappears-after-40-years/)   Farmers in the Victorian Wimmera and the Upper South East of South Australia are set to be confronted with a fungal disease they have not seen at damaging levels since the 1970s. Septoria tritici blotch has built up to levels that could cause significant damage this year 2017.  Agriculture Victoria cereal pathologist Grant Hollaway said septoria is now the major fungal disease issue in south-west Victoria. \"It has really emerged as a problem over the past five or six years.\" He said the major threat would be in the medium rainfall zone where the disease had not been spotted for many years. \"Septoria was common in the Wimmera in low levels last year 2016 and this has provided the carryover inoculum.\"  There are parallels in septoria's reappearance after a lengthy absence with that of stripe rust, which Dr Hollaway said returned to Victoria in 2003 following a 20 year hiatus. \"It is more of a stripe rust in terms of the damage it can cause,\" he said.  Byline: Gregor Heard   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  Septoria leaf blotch of cereals is caused by fungi in the septoria species complex, which includes _Zymoseptoria tritici_ (previously _Septoria tritici_), _Mycosphaerella graminicola_ and _Phaeosphaeria nodorum_ (previously _Stagonospora nodorum_). They affect mainly wheat, but also barley and oats and occasionally rye and some grass species. Symptoms on wheat and barley are very similar and may occur at any time during the growth cycle and on any portion of the plant. They include blotches on both leaves and glumes, which reduce the photosynthetic ability of the host. Disease development is favoured by humid conditions. Up to 50 per cent yield losses have been reported on susceptible varieties.  Spores can be spread by infected plant material, wind, water (rain splash) and mechanical means. The pathogens can overwinter on crop debris and on autumn sown crops or volunteers. Disease management includes fungicide treatments aimed at preventing the disease becoming established on the upper 3 leaves of the crop canopy (where it would affect the ears most), removal of inoculum sources and use of resistant varieties. After the cereal rusts, the disease is considered the most important challenge to plant breeders (see ProMED-mail post http://promedmail.org/post/20120831.1274190) and a threat to food security worldwide.  Pathogen strains with high levels of resistance to many fungicides are emerging, for example, in the UK and other parts of Europe (ProMED-mail post http://promedmail.org/post/20160516.4225677), as well as Australia and New Zealand (ProMED-mail posts http://promedmail.org/post/20161031.4598540, http://promedmail.org/post/20140417.2410219). In Australia, STB was reported as the 1st wheat disease developing fungicide resistance on that continent (ProMED-mail post http://promedmail.org/post/20140313.2329774). The possibility cannot be excluded that the re-emergence of STB in eastern Australia may be due to new fungal strains which have adapted to local conditions.  Stripe rust (_Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_), also mentioned above, can result in yield losses of 40 to 100 per cent. New strains with increased virulence are emerging and this disease is currently causing the most damage to wheat crops on a global scale.

Disease severity can range from asymptomatic infection to serious and sometimes fatal illness, particularly in young children and the elderly (3,4).  Healthy ruminants, particularly cattle, are the reservoir for EHEC (5). Human infection with EHEC usually occurs as a result of inadvertent ingestion of fecal matter after consumption of contaminated food, water, or unpasteurized milk; contact with animals or their environments; or secondarily, through contact with infected humans (4,5). In the largest previously reported outbreak of EHEC illness in Australia in 1995, which was associated with consumption of mettwurst (uncooked, semidry, fermented sausages), HUS developed in 23 of the 51 case-patients identified, and there was 1 death (6).  The Study  A multidisciplinary incident management team was established to investigate an outbreak of EHEC illness associated with an annual agricultural show in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, in August 2013. The incident management team defined primary and secondary outbreak cases. Persons with laboratory-confirmed EHEC infection associated with the outbreak and their household contacts were followed up until the point of microbiological evidence of clearance, which was defined as 2 consecutive negative stool samples collected more than 24h apart (7).  Case-patients and contacts with a high risk for transmission (persons under 5 years of age; persons unable to maintain good hygiene; or childcare, healthcare, aged care, or food preparation workers) were advised to avoid childcare and work settings in accordance with Queensland Health Guidelines (7). Enhanced surveillance measures were implemented to assist with case finding. Medical practitioners were requested to avoid use of antimicrobial drugs for suspected case-patients with EHEC infections because of previously reported associations between antimicrobial drug use and HUS. We developed a case-control study to obtain additional information related to animal contact, hand hygiene, and food consumption at the agricultural show. We analyzed data by using Epi Info 7 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA). EHEC identified from human, environmental, and animal samples were serotyped for O and H antigens. Expression of Shiga toxin 1 (stx1) and stx2 genes was determined for selected isolates. Shiga toxin gene subtyping and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis was performed.  During 21 Aug 2013 to 27 Sep 2013, we identified 57 outbreak-associated laboratory-confirmed case-patients with EHEC infection: 54 confirmed primary case-patients, 1 probable primary case-patient, and 2 secondary case-patients (Figure 1 for figures, see original URL - Mod. LL). Of the 57 cases-patients, 32 (56 percent) were female. Case-patients ranged in age from 1 to 77 (median 9) years; 31 (56 percent) case-patients were (10 years of age. Median incubation period after attending the agricultural show was 4 (range 1-11, 25th-75th percentile 3-5) days. Case-patients reported diarrhea (96 percent), abdominal pain (93 percent), bloody diarrhea (41 percent), and fever (32 percent) (Table 1). A total of 7 case-patients were hospitalized. No cases of HUS or deaths were reported.  Public Health Units followed up 40 case-patients until microbiological evidence of clearance; the remaining case-patients were lost to follow up. Median duration of EHEC excretion among primary case-patients was 18 (range 2-52) days (Table 2). After 27 days and 6 recurrent stools positive for EHEC, and after acute diarrheal illness had resolved, 1 child was given azithromycin on day 40 for 3 days to hasten decolonization. 2 consecutive stool specimens obtained more than 48 h after treatment with antimicrobial drugs was stopped were negative for EHEC in this child. This patient did not have any adverse effects from azithromycin treatment.  A total of 45 of 55 primary case-patients and 28 household contacts who attended the agricultural show were included in the case-control study. Median age of case-patients was 8 (range 1-77) years, and median age of controls was 38 (range 1-70) years. We showed by using univariate analysis that case-patients were not more likely than controls to have entered the animal nursery at the show. Case-patients were more likely than controls to have had contact with lambs or goats, fed the animals, or had their hands licked by animals.  We identified the same multilocus variable number tandem repeat and stx subtype genotype of _E. coli_ O157:H- in human case-patients, animal bedding from the animal nursery before disposal, and fecal samples collected from lambs, goats, and calves. WGS and read mapping to an _E. coli_ O157 reference genome showed that of the human, animal, and environmental isolates analyzed, all contained an IS1203v insertion that resulted in deletion of the first 494 bp of the stx2c subunit A gene (Figure 2). Expression of stx2 was not detected in these isolates by Immunocard STAT! EHEC (Meridian Bioscience, Cincinnati, OH, USA) and Shiga toxin Quik Chek (Alere, Waltham, MA, USA) lateral flow devices. No additional stx2 genes were identified, and no disruptions were detected in the stx1 gene regions of any of the isolates.  Conclusions  We found that EHEC infection was associated with feeding lambs or goats, feeding animals, and having the hands licked by animals. The course of _E. coli_ O157 infection was relatively mild; no cases of HUS were associated with this outbreak. Heiman et al. found that of 4928 cases of 390 _E. coli_ O157 illness outbreaks in the USA during 2003-2012, HUS was detected in 299 cases (6 percent of illnesses) (8). HUS cases with stx1+/stx2 _E. coli_ O157 isolates have been reported (9,10). We speculate that the absence of severe complications in this outbreak might have been caused, in part, by disruption of the stx2 subunit A gene by the IS1203v insertion, which resulted in lack of expression or a nonfunctional Stx2 toxin.  The proportion of case-patients reporting bloody diarrhea (19/46, 41 percent) was also lower than previously reported. Ethelberg et al. reported that 69 percent (56/81) of case-patients in Denmark infected with _E. coli_ O157 had bloody diarrhea (11). A recent retrospective cohort study reported that 61 percent (2027/3323) of symptomatic case-patients infected with _E. coli_ O157 Public Health England had bloody diarrhea. Bloody diarrhea was reported to be a risk factor for HUS (odds ratio 2.10; p = 0.001) (12). In the outbreak we studied, children under 5 years of age were less likely than older children and adults to report bloody diarrhea. EHEC infection should be actively considered for young children with non-bloody diarrhea who were exposed to potential sources of EHEC.  In this outbreak, 1 child was given azithromycin for 3 days to hasten decolonization some weeks after the acute diarrheal illness had resolved. Antimicrobial drugs are generally not recommended to hasten EHEC decolonization because of major associations with HUS (13). Recommendations to avoid high risk activities (such as childcare attendance) might place a major socioeconomic burden on EHEC carriers and their families. Further studies are required to assess whether WGS can provide useful information for safe administration of antimicrobial drugs for treatment of acute illness caused by EHEC, or when chronic shedding becomes established.  Our comprehensive study of a large outbreak _E. coli_ O157 illness, characterized by an IS1203v insertion disrupting the stx2c subunit A gene, showed mild clinical illness and an absence of HUS. Further characterization by virulence studies on isolates with this stx2c subunit A gene disruption might provide further insights into the mild illness caused by this strain.  References - 1.

It may well be the case that the IS1203v insertion that resulted in deletion of the first 494 bp of the stx2c subunit A gene may have been the cause of milder illness. Regarding azithromycin use, azithromycin and the carbapenem antimicrobial class are among a small group of antibacterials that do not appear to precipitate a higher risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome. Azithromycin was used for late clearance of the EHEC here and I have had anecdotal experience doing the same thing in an asymptomatic chronic carrier of EHEC O157 without any adverse effects. - Mod.LL  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/285).

Date: Tue 29 Aug 2017 21:06 (http://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2017-08-29/bluetongue-line-moves-south-in-the-nt/8848908)   Approximately 20 new properties within Central Australia and the Barkly now fall within the bluetongue virus zone within the Northern Territory, according to the Department of Primary Industry.  Changes to the zone, introduced last month July 2017, mean 10 of those additional properties are within the transmission zone, and 10 within the surveillance zone.  Bluetongue is an insect borne, non-contagious viral disease, and the changes mean properties affected will not be able to export to a number of markets that have restrictions in place, such as China and Turkey.  Peter Saville, senior veterinary officer in Alice Springs with the Department, said in his 14 years working in the area, the line was the lowest he had ever seen it.  \"What we found is that a number of properties north of the Alice Springs districts have had cattle which have seroconverted, which means that they've been exposed to the bluetongue virus, and those properties are much further south than they normally are.\"  Weather to blame According to Mr Saville, the change earlier in the year was due to a summer of high temperatures and high rainfall, resulting in the increased number of insects. \"It is insect movement that controls this, and as such there's not a lot we can do, so we just have to wait and see, we can't speculate on what might happen,\" he said.  Mr Saville said ownership changes could affect zoning.  \"One of the things that has contributed to this is a lot of properties have amalgamated their pics property identification codes because they're now under one ownership, and that means that even if part of their property is in a zone then the whole of the property is regarded as being in that zone.\"  Fluid line movement However Mr Saville said the line could once again move north depending on weather.  \"We wait until the end of summer, the end of the transmission season, and then we go out and test a number of properties to find out if there's been any evidence of viral activity.  \"Once those results are in, the NAMP National Arbovirus Monitoring Program committee meets and decides where the blue tongue line is going to go, and where the limits of the zones are.\"  Mr Saville said producers should visit the Animal Health Australia website if they want more information about the changes, and contact their livestock agent.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)   <br><br><strong>{2}</strong>. Date: Thu 30 Aug 2017. From: Mark Shipp (Mark.Schipp@agriculture.gov.au) (edited)   The National Arbovirus Monitoring Program (NAMP) maps areas in Australia where bluetongue virus transmission occurs, using both sentinel herds and additional sampling of herds when mustered.  Sentinel herds are bled and tested regularly, however in very remote areas where sentinel herds are not practical, cattle are sampled during the annual muster.  Bluetongue viral transmission occurs in parts of Australia but disease has not been reported.  There is a buffer zone between the zone where bluetongue virus transmission can occur and the zone free of bluetongue virus transmission. This is called the surveillance zone and is 50 Km 31.06 mi wide. The distance maintained between records of viral transmission and the boundary of the free zone is always maintained at a distance of 100 km 62.13 and follows property boundaries.  Yearly variation in the distribution of the main insect vector Culicoides brevitarisis means that the NAMP records some variation in the zone boundary from year to year. The map was most recently updated on Wed 16 Aug 2017. Detection of viral transmission immediately results in a zone expansion however zone contraction requires 2 years of negative surveillance results. The variations in the boundary are generally small and are considered routine. The NT example is confounded by changes in the management of land that have seen the amalgamation of properties. Because the zone boundary follows property boundaries this has exaggerated the zone extension. Property sizes can be extensive; up to 12 000 square km 4633.22 square miles in some cases.  There can be a lag period observed between viral transmission and antibody detection, particularly where surveillance is based on sampling mustered animals rather than sentinel herds. This maybe where the confusion has arisen in the quoted media report. Sero-conversion was detected in winter but arose from insect activity earlier in the season. The media report is inaccurate in relation to market access.  Recently negotiated conditions with China allow access for Australian feeder and slaughter cattle raised in areas where bluetongue virus transmission can occur. Parts of China record transmission of bluetongue virus year round and most of China (like parts of Australia) experiences times in the year where bluetongue viral transmission can occur (seasonal transmission).  The bulk of cattle in the Northern Territory are exported to markets that are endemic for bluetongue and while export conditions are applied, they are generally not trade restrictive.  The report of the zone expansion is publically available through the NAMP web site that is hosted on the Animal Health in Australia Web site.  It is certainly true that some markets require animals to be sourced from bluetongue virus free areas. This is the main reason that the NAMP program is maintained as it provides access for Australian cattle to these markets by confirming a zone free from viral transmission.  Objectives of the NAMP are: 1. Market access - to facilitate the export of live cattle, sheep and goats, and ruminant genetic material, to countries with concerns about bluetongue, Akabane and bovine ephemeral fever (BEF) viruses 2. Bluetongue early warning - to detect incursions of exotic strains of bluetongue virus (BTV) and vectors (Culicoides species biting midges) into Australia by surveillance of the northern BTV epidemic area. 3. Risk management - to detect changes in the seasonal distribution in Australia of endemic bluetongue, Akabane and BEF viruses and their vectors, to support livestock exporters.   Mark Schipp Chief Veterinary Officer (Australia) OIE Delegate (Australia) Vice-President OIE Assembly 7 London Cct, Canberra ACT 2600 GPO Box 858, Australia (mark.schipp@agriculture.gov.au)  In previous situations the line has been moved to reflect the seroconverstion, not actual disease discoveries. I reached out to Dr Schipp with some questions. Below are our question and answers:  ProMED-mail moderator (hence PMM): It appears this is a standard line movement based on seroconverstion - without actual disease? Could you clarify for me please?  Dr Schipp: Yes this is a regular adjustment of line to reflect seroconverstion with clinical disease.  PMM: Also the way this article is written is a bit confusing to me. As it is late August/1st of September, so I am thinking you may in late winter/early spring, yet the article above talks about frosts in the winter?  Dr Schipp: The hope expressed by Dr Saville is that the frosts currently being experienced in the central Austral winter will deplete the number of _Culicoides_ able to over winter to then become abundant in the spring and summer.  ProMED-mail thanks Dr Schipp for his promt reply and for taking the time to clarify issues regarding the surveillance line.  Information for understanding Bluetongue. Bluetongue virus (BTV) can and does affect cattle.  The disease is caused by an orbivirus belonging to the family _Reoviridae_. There are 25 serotypes of bluetongue virus and 10 of these have been isolated in Australia. Orbiviruses are insect-borne viruses (arboviruses) transmitted by _Culicoides_ midges. Many other non bluetongue orbiviruses are also endemic in Australia.  Bluetongue is an insect-borne, viral disease that can affect sheep, goats, deer, and cattle. Sheep are the most seriously affected species; clinical disease and mortalities occur and production and trade losses may result. Most infections in cattle are unapparent.  A number of bluetongue serotypes are present in Australia, but the severe clinical disease seen in other countries has not occurred here. Disease has been produced in experimentally infected sheep with some serotypes present in Australia.  Bluetongue virus serotype 1 was 1st identified in Australia in 1975 from trapped insects in the Northern Territory (NT) but despite its long-term presence, it has not caused any clinical disease. Since that time 9 more serotypes have been isolated in the NT. The distribution of BTV in Australia has been monitored in the National Arbovirus Monitoring Program (NAMP) for many years and the zones of BTV virus transmission and freedom are mapped and updated regularly on the Animal Health Australia website. - Mod.TG  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/292).

The total amount of dead wild boars discovered in the woods around\nZlín, in the far east of the Czech Republic, stood at 94 at the end\nof August 2017. In this month, 23 new infected carcasses were found,\nwhich is a downward trend from July 2017, when 68 reports were sent\nto the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). The 1st report of\nASF in Czech wild boars was on Wed 21 Jun 2017. Many neighbouring countries have alerted their local pig producers to\nbe very careful what to feed their pigs - and their inhabitants what\nto purchase and how to dispose of it. So did Slovakia, according to\nthe Slovak Spectator. Zlín is only a few km away from the western\nSlovak border, to its north is Poland where ASF has been around since\n2014 and on its eastern border is Ukraine, where ASF has been\nconfirmed since 2011. In a presentation, given in mid-July 2017 to the European\nCommission's Standing Committee On Animals, Plants, Food and Feed\n(SCoPAFF), Dr Petr Šatrán of the Czech State Veterinary\nAdministration indicated that human activities are most likely the\ncause of the spread of the virus, seeing that the nearest reported\ncases of ASF were roughly 500 km 310.68 mi away and that the\npositive dead wild boars were found in inhabited areas. In the other country where ASF was found for the 1st time in 2017,\nRomania, things appear relatively quiet. News broke early this month\nAugust 2017 that ASF was also found on 2 backyard farms in the north\nof the country. Ever since, the Romanian authorities did not report\nany further outbreaks of ASF to the OIE. Of all other countries in the European Union, especially Poland has\ncontinued to report outbreaks of African Swine Fever in smaller and\nmiddle-sized operations. In August alone, on 23 farm sites of various\nsizes, ASF was found to have infected at least one animal, after which\nthe entire herd would have to be culled. The biggest operation in this respect was a farm near Monki, Podlaskie\nprovince, where all remaining 431 pigs had to be culled after 11 had\ndied as a result of ASF, on Sat 19 Aug 2017. Noteworthy as well was\nthe ASF-related closure of 2 farms in Lack, Lubelskie province, in\nearly August. These farms had 136 and 141 pigs respectively see also\nitem 2.

This was said by Poland's Minister of Agriculture,\nKrzysztof Yurgel, Niezalezna reports. As reported, the length of the fence will be 729 km 452.98 mi,\ncosting Poland 130 million zloties (more than 36.2 million USD). The\nfinal decision on a fence will be made within the next 3 weeks. According to experts, ASF has developed in the territory of Poland\n\"thanks to\" the wild boars who entered from Belarus. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) The accumulated ASF OIE data from Poland as of Thu 31 Aug 2017, are\nas follows (start of event 22 May 2014):\nNumber of follow-up reports: 189\nTotal outbreaks: 550 (Submitted)\nSpecies/ Susceptible/ Cases/ Deaths/ Killed and disposed of/\nSlaughtered\nWild boar/ - / 620 / 620 / 0 / 0\nDomestic Swine/ 6303/ 402/ 188/ 6097/ 0 A map showing ASF cases reported globally to the OIE since 1 Jan 2017,\nas of Thu 31 Aug 2017, is available at (http://tinyurl.com/ybexasqm).\nClick on the European cluster, zoom in to each of the countries of\ninterest. EU disease control measures require designation of risk areas as Part\nI (wild boar at risk, but no cases found), Part II (wild boar testing\npositive but no spill over into domestic pigs), Part III (cases in\nwild boar and occasional spill over into domestic pigs) and Part IV\nwhich concerns the island of Sardinia only. Consignments of live pigs,\nlive wild boars, meat of either source and animal by-products of\neither source are only allowed under certain derogations. For a full\nexplanation, see European Commission Implementing Decision\n2014/708/EU. ASF, a viral disease against which no vaccine has become available so\nfar, is currently threatening central and western Europe, where dense\npopulations of wild boar are present. According to a recent update of DEFRA (UK) ASF situation assessment,\nthe continuing cases in the Czech Republic, the spread in Poland which\nappears to be due to several breakdowns in biosecurity and the new\noutbreaks in Romania are \"concerning\". This signifies a spread in\ngeographic distribution, a possible drop in biosecurity awareness and\ntherefore an increase in the weight of infection in East Europe. Despite the relatively low level of trade in live pigs, there could be\na substantial movement of people, vehicles and personal imports of\npork products, therefore the risk of ASF introduction to the UK has\nbeen raised from \"very low\" (that is, \"rare but could occur\") to\n\"low\". The Russian veterinary watchdog Rosselkhoznadzor believes ASF will\nkeep moving west via 2 main pathways. The southerly route, has already\nseen the virus spread from Ukraine to Moldova. Russian vets believe it\ncould penetrate central Romania, then move to the Balkans, including\nBulgaria and Serbia. On the northern route, now that ASF has been found in the Czech\nRepublic, Rosselkhoznadzor believes, if it gains a foothold, it is\nlikely to head further west, with Germany next in the firing line. The\nsaid is included in a recent update by the Russian journalist\nVladislav Vorotnikov, available at\n(http://www.pig-world.co.uk/comment/where-next-for-african-swine-fever.html).\n- Mod.AS ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Belgium":{},"Belize":{"122":{"title":"Ciguatera fish poisoning - Belize: barracuda,\r\n\talert ","date":["26","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH/EDR> Ciguatera fish poisoning - Belize: barracuda,\r\n\talert [EXTERNAL]","summary":"\nCIGUATERA FISH POISONING - BELIZE: BARRACUDA, ALERT\n*\nA ProMED-mail post\n(http://www.promedmail.org)\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n(http://www.isid.org).

In the 1st alert, issued on Fri 18 Aug 2017, the Ministry of Health\nreported that \"suspected fish poisoning (Ciguatera poisoning) was\ndetected in people that had eaten fish bought from a fish vendor in\nLadyville, Belize District.\" In the 2nd alert, issued on Tue 23 Aug\n2017, the Ministry said that 2 further cases of suspected Ciguatera\npoisoning, linked to the consumption of the large predatory fish, had\nbeen identified. \"Investigations conducted so far reveal that the\nbarracuda fish from the Turneffe Islands area has been the sole\ncarrier of the ciguaxtoin or poison,\" the alert said. It warned that\ntoxic fish does not have any odor or taste and cooking and freezing\ndoes not eliminate the toxin. According to the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),\nciguatera fish poisoning (or ciguatera) is an illness caused by eating\nfish that contain toxins produced by a marine microalgae called\n_Gambierdiscus toxicus_, associated with corals. Whereas the barracuda\nis believed to be the culprit for the most recent bouts of illness\ncaused by the toxin, other fish may also carry the toxin, including\ncoral trout, red snapper, donu, parrot fish, grouper, Spanish\nmackerel, red emperor, wrasse, reef cod, sturgeon fish, trevally and\nmoray eel. The CDC also lists blackfin snapper, cubera snapper, dog\nsnapper, greater amberjack, hogfish, horse-eye jack, and king mackerel\namong the fish which have been known to carry ciguatoxins. \"Anyone who consumes fish contaminated with the ciguatera toxin will\nbecome ill,\" the Ministry's alert said, adding that, \"The\ngastrointestinal or stomach symptoms normally appear within 24 hours\nof exposure and those of the nervous system can appear 1 to 2 days\nlater.\" Although some symptoms may last only a few days, in some\ncases, the toxin can continue to affect those who ingest it for\nmonths. The CDC says people who have ciguatera may find that cold\nthings feel hot and hot things feel cold. The Belize Ministry of Health has shared some guidelines for reducing\nthe risk of CFP. It advises the following:\n- Avoid eating larger reef fish that have a greater likelihood of\ncarrying ciguatoxins, especially the barracuda. - Limit the weight of a fish to less than 11 pounds, as ciguatera fish\npoisoning occurs more frequently in larger fish. - Eat other types of fish not listed above.\n- Avoid eating the head, roe or fish egg, liver, or other organs of\nthe fish, as it is where the highest level of toxin is present. Byline: Adele Ramos \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) A recent open access review of ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) has\nbeen published in Marine Drugs:\nFriedman MA , Fernandez M, Backer LC, et al: An updated review of\nCiguatera Fish Poisoning: Clinical, epidemiological, environmental,\nand public health management. Mar Drugs 2017, 15(3): pii: E72;\ndoi:10.3390/md15030072; available at:\n(http://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/15/3/72/htm.\nThe publication does not say that the intoxication occurs related to\nfish from European waters. The description of the acute illness with\nthe citations intact (the citations can be found at the original URL)\nhas been extracted below: \"CFP is characterized by gastrointestinal, neurological, and\ncardiovascular symptoms. In addition, after the initial or acute\nillness, neuropsychological symptoms may be reported. Clinical\nfeatures can vary depending on elapsed time since eating the toxic\nmeal, and whether the geographic source of the implicated ﬁsh was\nthe Caribbean Sea, Paciﬁc, or Indian Ocean 17,36,52-58.\nGastrointestinal symptoms and signs usually begin within 6-12 hours of\nﬁsh consumption and resolve spontaneously within 1-4 days.\nGastrointestinal symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal\npain, and diarrhea. The neurologic symptoms usually present within the\n1st 2 days of illness. They often become prominent after the\ngastrointestinal symptoms (particularly in CFP events from Caribbean\nﬁsh), although they may present concurrently with gastrointestinal\nsymptoms (K Schrank, written communication, April 2016) <br><br><strong>{59}</strong>. The\nneurologic symptoms vary among patients and include paresthesias (that\nis, numbness or tingling) in the hands and feet or oral region,\nmetallic taste, sensation of loose teeth, generalized pruritus\n(itching), myalgia (muscle pain), arthralgia (joint pain), headache,\nand dizziness. A distinctive neurologic symptom is cold allodynia,\nsometimes referred to as \"hot-cold reversal,\" an alteration of\ntemperature perception in which touching cold surfaces produces a\nburning sensation or a dysesthesia (that is, unpleasant, abnormal\nsensation) <br><br><strong>{60}</strong>. One study revealed that intra-cutaneous injection of\nCTX in humans elicited this sensation <br><br><strong>{61}</strong>. Cold allodynia is\nconsidered pathognomonic of CFP, although not all patients report\nexperiencing it and it can be seen with other human seafood poisoning\nsyndromes (such as neurotoxic shellﬁsh poisoning). Less commonly,\nsevere central nervous system symptoms, such as coma or\nhallucinations, have been reported 54,62,63. Neuropsychological\nsymptoms, which often become apparent in the days or weeks after the\ninitial or acute illness, include subjectively reported cognitive\ncomplaints such as confusion, reduced memory, and difficulty\nconcentrating 64-67, depression or irritability 64,65,68, and\nanxiety <br><br><strong>{65}</strong>. Fatigue or malaise have been reported and may be\ndebilitating 6,62,69,70. Cardiac symptoms and signs may manifest,\ngenerally in the early stage of the illness. When present, they\nusually occur in combination with gastrointestinal and/or neurologic\nsigns and symptoms 71,72. Cardiac signs often include hypotension\nand bradycardia which may necessitate emergency medical care.\" -\nMod.LL A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at:\n(http://healthmap.org/promed/p/19).

The recent outbreaks of ZIKV in Brazil and French\nPolynesia have been linked to a considerable increase in the incidence\nof fetal microcephaly and other diseases such as Guillain-Barre\nsyndrome. Because there is currently no specific therapy or vaccine,\nthe early exploitation of a method to prevent expansion of ZIKV is a\nhigh priority. To validate commonly used antiviral drugs, we evaluated\nthe effect of ribavirin, a drug used to treat hepatitis C with\ninterferon-beta (IFN-beta), on ZIKV replication. In mammalian cells,\nwe observed an inhibitory effect of ribavirin on ZIKV replication and\nZIKV-induced cell death without cytotoxic effect. Furthermore, we\nfound that STAT1-deficient mice, which lack type I IFN signaling, were\nhighly sensitive to ZIKV infection and exhibited lethal outcome.\nRibavirin abrogated viremia in ZIKV-infected STAT-1-deficient mice.\nThese data suggest that the inhibition of viral RNA-dependent RNA\npolymerases may be effective for treatment of ZIKV infection. Our data\nprovide a new insight into the mechanisms for inhibition of ZIKV\nreplication and prevention of Zika fever. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) It will be interesting to see if these encouraging results showing\ninhibition of Zika virus replication can be replicated in non-human\nprimates. The challenge for use of drugs to inhibit Zika virus\ninfection in humans is that most (around 80 percent) Zika virus\ninfections are asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms. These\nindividuals will probably not seek medical treatment, even though\ntheir fetuses are at risk of infection with teratogenic effects. -\nMod.TY \n<br><br><strong>{3}</strong> Zika virus skewed immunosuppression.\nDate: Mon 21 Aug 2017.\nSource: Nature Microbiology journal (edited)\n(http://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-017-0016-3) \nref: Foo SS, Chen W, Chan Y, et al. Asian Zika virus strains target\nCD14+ blood monocytes and induce M2-skewed immunosuppression during\npregnancy. Nat Microbiol. 2017. doi: 10.1038/s41564-017-0016-3\n-\nAbstract\nBlood CD14+ monocytes are frontline immunomodulators categorized into\nclassical, intermediate or non-classical subsets, and subsequently\ndifferentiated into M1 pro- or M2 anti-inflammatory macrophages on\nstimulation. Although the Zika virus (ZIKV) rapidly establishes\nviraemia, the target cells and immune responses, particularly during\npregnancy, remain elusive. Furthermore, it is unknown whether African-\nand Asian-lineage ZIKV have different phenotypic impacts on host\nimmune responses. Using human blood infection, we identified CD14+\nmonocytes as the primary target for African- or Asian-lineage ZIKV\ninfection. When immunoprofiles of human blood infected with ZIKV were\ncompared, a classical/intermediate monocyte-mediated M1-skewed\ninflammation by the African-lineage ZIKV infection was observed, in\ncontrast to a non-classical monocyte-mediated M2-skewed\nimmunosuppression by the Asian-lineage ZIKV infection. Importantly,\ninfection of the blood of pregnant women revealed an enhanced\nsusceptibility to ZIKV infection. Specifically, Asian-lineage ZIKV\ninfection of pregnant women's blood led to an exacerbated M2-skewed\nimmunosuppression of non-classical monocytes in conjunction with a\nglobal suppression of type I interferon-signaling pathway and an\naberrant expression of host genes associated with pregnancy\ncomplications. Also, 30 ZIKV+ sera from symptomatic pregnant patients\nshowed elevated levels of M2-skewed immunosuppressive cytokines and\npregnancy-complication-associated fibronectin-1. This study\ndemonstrates the differential immunomodulatory responses of blood\nmonocytes, particularly during pregnancy, on infection with different\nlineages of ZIKV. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{4}</strong> Virus alters mosquito genes.\nDate: Tue 22 Aug 2017.\nSource: bioRxiv journal (edited)\n(http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/22/179416) \nref: Etebari K, Hegde S, Saldana MA, et al. Global transcriptome\nanalysis of _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes in response to Zika virus\ninfection. bioRxiv 179416; doi:10.1101/179416\n-\nZika virus (ZIKV) of the Flaviviridae family is a recently emerged\nmosquito-borne virus that has been implicated in the surge of the\nnumber of microcephaly instances in South America. The recent rapid\nspread of the virus led to its declaration as a global health\nemergency by the World Health Organization. The virus is transmitted\nmainly by the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_ that also vectors dengue virus,\nhowever little is known about the interactions of the virus with the\nmosquito vector. In this study, we investigated the transcriptome\nprofiles of whole _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes in response to ZIKV\ninfection at 2, 7, and 14 days post-infection using RNA-Seq. Results\nshowed changes in the abundance of a large number of transcripts at\neach time point following infection, with 18 transcripts commonly\nchanged among the 3 time points. Gene ontology analysis revealed that\nmost of the altered genes are involved in metabolic process, cellular\nprocess and proteolysis. In addition, 486 long intergenic non-coding\nRNAs were identified altered upon ZIKV infection. Further, we found\ncorrelational changes of a number of potential mRNA target genes with\nthat of altered host microRNAs. The outcomes provide a basic\nunderstanding of _Ae. aegypti_ responses to ZIKV and helps to\ndetermine host factors involved in replication or mosquito host\nanti-viral response against the virus. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) Mosquito vector competence depends on the relationship of virus and\nthe mosquito, and the defenses that the mosquito can mobilize against\nthe virus infection. Studies, such as the one above, can document the\nchanges that occur when the virus infects the mosquito, and if\ndifferences in relative vector efficiency of different geographic\nstrains of this mosquito might be related to alternations in mosquito\ngenes when infected. It would be interesting to know if these gene\nchanges affect fitness, and especially longevity of infected\nmosquitoes. - Mod.TY \n<br><br><strong>{5}</strong> Virus effects on sperm, body fluids.\nDate: Mon 21 Aug 2017.\nSource: The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal (edited)\n(http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(17)30444-9/abstract) \nref: Joguet G, Mansuy JM, Matusali G, et al.

To investigate the effects of Zika\nvirus infection on semen and clearance of Zika virus from semen and\nbody fluids, we aimed to study a cohort of Zika virus-infected men. Methods\nThis prospective observational study recruited men presenting with\nacute Zika virus infection at Pointe-Ã -Pitre University Hospital in\nGuadeloupe, French Caribbean, where a Zika virus outbreak occurred\nbetween April and November, 2016. Blood, urine, and semen were\ncollected at days 7, 11, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 after symptom onset,\nand semen characteristics, such as total sperm count, sperm motility,\nvitality, and morphology, and reproductive hormone concentrations,\nsuch as testosterone, inhibin, follicle-stimulating hormone, and\nluteinising hormone, were assessed. At days 7, 11, and 20, semen was\nprocessed to isolate motile spermatozoa. Zika virus RNA was detected\nby RT-PCR using whole blood, serum, urine, seminal plasma, semen\ncells, and motile spermatozoa fractions. Zika virus was isolated from\ndifferent sperm fractions on Vero E6 cultures. Findings\n15 male volunteers (mean age 35 years SD 5; range 25-44) with acute\nZika virus infection and positive Zika virus RNA detection in blood or\nurine were enrolled. Total sperm count was decreased from median\n119âÃâ10^6 spermatozoa (IQR interquartile range 22-234)\nat day 7, to 45.2âÃâ10^6 (16.5-89.6) at day 30, and 70\nÃ 10^6 (28.5-81.4) at day 60, respectively, after Zika virus\ninfection. Inhibin values increased from 93.5 pg/mL (IQR 55-162) at\nday 7 to 150 pg/mL (78-209) at day 120 when total sperm count\nrecovered. In motile spermatozoa obtained after density gradient\nseparation, Zika virus RNA was found in 3 of 14 patients at day 7, 4\nof 15 at day 11, and 4 of 15 at day 20, and replication-competent\nvirus was found in the tested patient. Seminal shedding kinetics\nseemed heterogeneous among patients. Whole blood was the fluid most\nfrequently positive for Zika virus RNA (62 of 92 samples) and 3\npatients remained positive at day 120. Interpretation\nSemen alterations early after acute Zika virus infection might affect\nfertility and could be explained by virus effects on the testis and\nepididymis. Frequency of shedding and high viral load in semen,\ntogether with the presence of replicative virus in a motile\nspermatozoa fraction, can lead to Zika virus transmission during\nsexual contact and assisted reproduction procedures. Whole blood seems\nto be the best specimen for Zika virus RNA detection, diagnosis, and\nfollow-up. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall In a new study that included 12 men in French Guiana who had Zika\nvirus, 4 never had any detectable Zika in their semen, 1 excreted Zika\nvirus in his semen for at least 3 days, and 7 had Zika virus in semen\nfor at least 1 month.

JAMA. 2017; 318(8):\n689. doi:10.1001/jama.2017.11200\n-\nResearchers funded in part by the National Institutes of Health have\nrecently demonstrated that 2 experimental vaccines can restrict\ntransmission of Zika virus from pregnant mice to their fetuses,\nthereby shielding offspring from congenital damage or death. Multiple candidate Zika vaccines have been shown protective against\ninfection with the virus in animal studies, with several now in human\ntrials, but none were tested in the context of pregnancy, according to\nthe authors of the study published in Cell\n(http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(17)30759-6). The 2\nvaccine candidates investigated in the new study are the 1st to\ndemonstrate efficacy in preventing vertical transmission of the virus\nand related fetal death in an animal model. Although the vaccines were\nadministered to female mice prior to pregnancy, the result is\nconsidered an important step toward developing a vaccine that could be\nsafely given to pregnant women. One of the 2 candidates is a modified messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine\nencoding Zika genes, developed by the biotechnology company Moderna.\nIt is already in safety trials in women who are not pregnant. The\nother is a live-attenuated Zika strain developed by researchers at the\nUniversity of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). The testing was carried out by scientists from the National Institute\nof Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Washington University School of\nMedicine, and UTMB. The researchers 1st vaccinated the mice with 1 of\nthe vaccines or a placebo. After mating, the animals were challenged\nwith the virus 6 days into pregnancy. A week later, more than 50\npercent of placentas and fetuses from mice administered the mRNA\nvaccine had virtually no Zika RNA. The remainder had \"substantially\nlower\" levels relative to placebo.\nThe live vaccine provided broader protection: 78 percent of placentas\nand 83 percent of fetuses had Zika RNA at or below the level of\ndetection, while the placebo group exhibited significantly higher\nlevels of placental and fetal Zika RNA. Mice vaccinated with either\nvaccine had significantly higher rates of fetal viability; whereas 100\npercent of fetuses from mice vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine were\nborn, none survived to term in the placebo group. A working group funded by the Wellcome Trust recently approved ethical\nguidelines for testing such vaccines in pregnant women, normally\nexcluded from drug trials. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) It is reassuring to learn that at least 2 vaccines are now entering\nclinical trials in women. Although anti-Zika virus drugs are under\ndevelopment, preventing infection through vaccination seems to be the\nmost effective measure to prevent fetal infection and adverse effects\nof the virus infection in adults. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"297":{"title":"Dengue/DHF update (11): Americas","date":["28","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Dengue/DHF update (11): Americas","summary":"\nDENGUE/DHF UPDATE (11): AMERICAS\n\nA ProMED-mail post\n(http://www.promedmail.org)\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n(http://www.isid.org) In this update:\nCases in various countries:\nAmericas regional\n\nCases in various countries not mentioned above or more recent case\nnumbers.

The recent outbreaks of ZIKV in Brazil and French\nPolynesia have been linked to a considerable increase in the incidence\nof fetal microcephaly and other diseases such as Guillain-Barre\nsyndrome. Because there is currently no specific therapy or vaccine,\nthe early exploitation of a method to prevent expansion of ZIKV is a\nhigh priority. To validate commonly used antiviral drugs, we evaluated\nthe effect of ribavirin, a drug used to treat hepatitis C with\ninterferon-beta (IFN-beta), on ZIKV replication. In mammalian cells,\nwe observed an inhibitory effect of ribavirin on ZIKV replication and\nZIKV-induced cell death without cytotoxic effect. Furthermore, we\nfound that STAT1-deficient mice, which lack type I IFN signaling, were\nhighly sensitive to ZIKV infection and exhibited lethal outcome.\nRibavirin abrogated viremia in ZIKV-infected STAT-1-deficient mice.\nThese data suggest that the inhibition of viral RNA-dependent RNA\npolymerases may be effective for treatment of ZIKV infection. Our data\nprovide a new insight into the mechanisms for inhibition of ZIKV\nreplication and prevention of Zika fever. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) It will be interesting to see if these encouraging results showing\ninhibition of Zika virus replication can be replicated in non-human\nprimates. The challenge for use of drugs to inhibit Zika virus\ninfection in humans is that most (around 80 percent) Zika virus\ninfections are asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms. These\nindividuals will probably not seek medical treatment, even though\ntheir fetuses are at risk of infection with teratogenic effects. -\nMod.TY \n<br><br><strong>{3}</strong> Zika virus skewed immunosuppression.\nDate: Mon 21 Aug 2017.\nSource: Nature Microbiology journal (edited)\n(http://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-017-0016-3) \nref: Foo SS, Chen W, Chan Y, et al. Asian Zika virus strains target\nCD14+ blood monocytes and induce M2-skewed immunosuppression during\npregnancy. Nat Microbiol. 2017. doi: 10.1038/s41564-017-0016-3\n-\nAbstract\nBlood CD14+ monocytes are frontline immunomodulators categorized into\nclassical, intermediate or non-classical subsets, and subsequently\ndifferentiated into M1 pro- or M2 anti-inflammatory macrophages on\nstimulation. Although the Zika virus (ZIKV) rapidly establishes\nviraemia, the target cells and immune responses, particularly during\npregnancy, remain elusive. Furthermore, it is unknown whether African-\nand Asian-lineage ZIKV have different phenotypic impacts on host\nimmune responses. Using human blood infection, we identified CD14+\nmonocytes as the primary target for African- or Asian-lineage ZIKV\ninfection. When immunoprofiles of human blood infected with ZIKV were\ncompared, a classical/intermediate monocyte-mediated M1-skewed\ninflammation by the African-lineage ZIKV infection was observed, in\ncontrast to a non-classical monocyte-mediated M2-skewed\nimmunosuppression by the Asian-lineage ZIKV infection. Importantly,\ninfection of the blood of pregnant women revealed an enhanced\nsusceptibility to ZIKV infection. Specifically, Asian-lineage ZIKV\ninfection of pregnant women's blood led to an exacerbated M2-skewed\nimmunosuppression of non-classical monocytes in conjunction with a\nglobal suppression of type I interferon-signaling pathway and an\naberrant expression of host genes associated with pregnancy\ncomplications. Also, 30 ZIKV+ sera from symptomatic pregnant patients\nshowed elevated levels of M2-skewed immunosuppressive cytokines and\npregnancy-complication-associated fibronectin-1. This study\ndemonstrates the differential immunomodulatory responses of blood\nmonocytes, particularly during pregnancy, on infection with different\nlineages of ZIKV. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{4}</strong> Virus alters mosquito genes.\nDate: Tue 22 Aug 2017.\nSource: bioRxiv journal (edited)\n(http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/22/179416) \nref: Etebari K, Hegde S, Saldana MA, et al. Global transcriptome\nanalysis of _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes in response to Zika virus\ninfection. bioRxiv 179416; doi:10.1101/179416\n-\nZika virus (ZIKV) of the Flaviviridae family is a recently emerged\nmosquito-borne virus that has been implicated in the surge of the\nnumber of microcephaly instances in South America. The recent rapid\nspread of the virus led to its declaration as a global health\nemergency by the World Health Organization. The virus is transmitted\nmainly by the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_ that also vectors dengue virus,\nhowever little is known about the interactions of the virus with the\nmosquito vector. In this study, we investigated the transcriptome\nprofiles of whole _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes in response to ZIKV\ninfection at 2, 7, and 14 days post-infection using RNA-Seq. Results\nshowed changes in the abundance of a large number of transcripts at\neach time point following infection, with 18 transcripts commonly\nchanged among the 3 time points. Gene ontology analysis revealed that\nmost of the altered genes are involved in metabolic process, cellular\nprocess and proteolysis. In addition, 486 long intergenic non-coding\nRNAs were identified altered upon ZIKV infection. Further, we found\ncorrelational changes of a number of potential mRNA target genes with\nthat of altered host microRNAs. The outcomes provide a basic\nunderstanding of _Ae. aegypti_ responses to ZIKV and helps to\ndetermine host factors involved in replication or mosquito host\nanti-viral response against the virus. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) Mosquito vector competence depends on the relationship of virus and\nthe mosquito, and the defenses that the mosquito can mobilize against\nthe virus infection. Studies, such as the one above, can document the\nchanges that occur when the virus infects the mosquito, and if\ndifferences in relative vector efficiency of different geographic\nstrains of this mosquito might be related to alternations in mosquito\ngenes when infected. It would be interesting to know if these gene\nchanges affect fitness, and especially longevity of infected\nmosquitoes. - Mod.TY \n<br><br><strong>{5}</strong> Virus effects on sperm, body fluids.\nDate: Mon 21 Aug 2017.\nSource: The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal (edited)\n(http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(17)30444-9/abstract) \nref: Joguet G, Mansuy JM, Matusali G, et al.

To investigate the effects of Zika\nvirus infection on semen and clearance of Zika virus from semen and\nbody fluids, we aimed to study a cohort of Zika virus-infected men. Methods\nThis prospective observational study recruited men presenting with\nacute Zika virus infection at Pointe-Ã -Pitre University Hospital in\nGuadeloupe, French Caribbean, where a Zika virus outbreak occurred\nbetween April and November, 2016. Blood, urine, and semen were\ncollected at days 7, 11, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 after symptom onset,\nand semen characteristics, such as total sperm count, sperm motility,\nvitality, and morphology, and reproductive hormone concentrations,\nsuch as testosterone, inhibin, follicle-stimulating hormone, and\nluteinising hormone, were assessed. At days 7, 11, and 20, semen was\nprocessed to isolate motile spermatozoa. Zika virus RNA was detected\nby RT-PCR using whole blood, serum, urine, seminal plasma, semen\ncells, and motile spermatozoa fractions. Zika virus was isolated from\ndifferent sperm fractions on Vero E6 cultures. Findings\n15 male volunteers (mean age 35 years SD 5; range 25-44) with acute\nZika virus infection and positive Zika virus RNA detection in blood or\nurine were enrolled. Total sperm count was decreased from median\n119âÃâ10^6 spermatozoa (IQR interquartile range 22-234)\nat day 7, to 45.2âÃâ10^6 (16.5-89.6) at day 30, and 70\nÃ 10^6 (28.5-81.4) at day 60, respectively, after Zika virus\ninfection. Inhibin values increased from 93.5 pg/mL (IQR 55-162) at\nday 7 to 150 pg/mL (78-209) at day 120 when total sperm count\nrecovered. In motile spermatozoa obtained after density gradient\nseparation, Zika virus RNA was found in 3 of 14 patients at day 7, 4\nof 15 at day 11, and 4 of 15 at day 20, and replication-competent\nvirus was found in the tested patient. Seminal shedding kinetics\nseemed heterogeneous among patients. Whole blood was the fluid most\nfrequently positive for Zika virus RNA (62 of 92 samples) and 3\npatients remained positive at day 120. Interpretation\nSemen alterations early after acute Zika virus infection might affect\nfertility and could be explained by virus effects on the testis and\nepididymis. Frequency of shedding and high viral load in semen,\ntogether with the presence of replicative virus in a motile\nspermatozoa fraction, can lead to Zika virus transmission during\nsexual contact and assisted reproduction procedures. Whole blood seems\nto be the best specimen for Zika virus RNA detection, diagnosis, and\nfollow-up. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall In a new study that included 12 men in French Guiana who had Zika\nvirus, 4 never had any detectable Zika in their semen, 1 excreted Zika\nvirus in his semen for at least 3 days, and 7 had Zika virus in semen\nfor at least 1 month. The maximum duration of detectable Zika in semen\nin the study was 45 days ((http://tinyurl.com/y9nhtgtk)).

Vaccines protect fetus from Zika. JAMA. 2017; 318(8):\n689. doi:10.1001/jama.2017.11200\n-\nResearchers funded in part by the National Institutes of Health have\nrecently demonstrated that 2 experimental vaccines can restrict\ntransmission of Zika virus from pregnant mice to their fetuses,\nthereby shielding offspring from congenital damage or death. Multiple candidate Zika vaccines have been shown protective against\ninfection with the virus in animal studies, with several now in human\ntrials, but none were tested in the context of pregnancy, according to\nthe authors of the study published in Cell\n(http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(17)30759-6). The 2\nvaccine candidates investigated in the new study are the 1st to\ndemonstrate efficacy in preventing vertical transmission of the virus\nand related fetal death in an animal model. Although the vaccines were\nadministered to female mice prior to pregnancy, the result is\nconsidered an important step toward developing a vaccine that could be\nsafely given to pregnant women. One of the 2 candidates is a modified messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine\nencoding Zika genes, developed by the biotechnology company Moderna.\nIt is already in safety trials in women who are not pregnant. The\nother is a live-attenuated Zika strain developed by researchers at the\nUniversity of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). The testing was carried out by scientists from the National Institute\nof Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Washington University School of\nMedicine, and UTMB. The researchers 1st vaccinated the mice with 1 of\nthe vaccines or a placebo. After mating, the animals were challenged\nwith the virus 6 days into pregnancy. A week later, more than 50\npercent of placentas and fetuses from mice administered the mRNA\nvaccine had virtually no Zika RNA. The remainder had \"substantially\nlower\" levels relative to placebo.\nThe live vaccine provided broader protection: 78 percent of placentas\nand 83 percent of fetuses had Zika RNA at or below the level of\ndetection, while the placebo group exhibited significantly higher\nlevels of placental and fetal Zika RNA. Mice vaccinated with either\nvaccine had significantly higher rates of fetal viability; whereas 100\npercent of fetuses from mice vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine were\nborn, none survived to term in the placebo group. A working group funded by the Wellcome Trust recently approved ethical\nguidelines for testing such vaccines in pregnant women, normally\nexcluded from drug trials. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) It is reassuring to learn that at least 2 vaccines are now entering\nclinical trials in women. Although anti-Zika virus drugs are under\ndevelopment, preventing infection through vaccination seems to be the\nmost effective measure to prevent fetal infection and adverse effects\nof the virus infection in adults. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"160":{"title":"Inappropriate vaccinia virus use - USA: (CA) stem cell clinic\r\n\t","date":["28","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Inappropriate vaccinia virus use - USA: (CA) stem cell clinic\r\n\t[EXTERNAL]","summary":"\nINAPPROPRIATE VACCINIA VIRUS USE - USA: (CALIFORNIA) STEM CELL CLINIC\n*\nA ProMED-mail post\n(http://www.promedmail.org)\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n(http://www.isid.org). Date: Mon 28 Aug 2017.\nSource: New York Times (edited)\n(https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/28/health/fda-stem-cell.html?_r=1) \nThe FDA US Food and Drug Administration announced a crackdown on\ndangerous stem cell clinics on Mon 28 Aug 2017, while at the same\ntime pledging to ease the path to approval for companies and doctors\nwith legitimate treatments in the growing field. The agency reported\nactions against 2 large stem cell clinics and a biotech company,\nsaying that it was critical to shut down \"unscrupulous actors\" in\nregenerative medicine, a broad umbrella that includes stem cell and\ngene therapies and immunotherapies. \"The FDA will not allow deceitful\nactors to take advantage of vulnerable patients by purporting to have\ntreatments or cures for serious diseases without any proof that they\nactually work,\" said Dr Scott Gottlieb, the FDA commissioner. Stem cells, which can be extracted from bone marrow, blood, or fat,\ncan develop into many different types of cells, and are thought to\nhave the potential to repair or replace tissue damaged by disease,\ninjury, or aging. But so far, the FDA has approved only a few\nstem-cell products. The companies that the FDA cited have been performing liposuction to\nremove belly fat from patients, extracting stem cells and then\ninjecting those cells back into the patients to treat various\nailments. On Fri 25 Aug 2017, the agency said, federal marshals seized 500\ndoses of live vaccinia virus vaccine for smallpox belonging to\nStemImmune Inc., a San Diego firm that develops stem cell-based\nimmunotherapies for cancer. The raid came after the FDA learned that\nthe vaccine was being used to create an unapproved stem cell product,\na combination of excess amounts of vaccine and stem cells derived from\nbody fat, which was then administered to cancer patients with\npotentially compromised immune systems. The FDA said patients at the\nCalifornia Stem Cell Treatment Centers in Rancho Mirage and Beverly\nHills, California, received the treatment made with the smallpox\nvaccine. It also said it had serious concerns about how StemImmune\nobtained the vaccine for use in an unapproved and potentially\ndangerous treatment. StemImmune obtained at least some of the vaccine from the CDC,\naccording to Thomas Skinner, a CDC spokesman. In its request, the\ncompany said it was conducting cancer research involving the vaccinia\nvirus, and needed to vaccinate researchers  a seemingly legitimate\nreason. The company did not tell the CDC that it was going to inject\nthe vaccine into patients, he said. A statement from StemImmune said\nthe company had lawfully obtained the drug. The FDA also issued a warning letter to US Stem Cell, a private clinic\nin Sunrise, Florida. The company was the subject of a March 2017\nreport in The New England Journal of Medicine, describing how one\nwoman went blind and 2 others suffered severe, permanent eye damage\nafter being given shots of stem cells, extracted from fat, into their\neyes. The warning letter accused the company of impairing the FDA's\nability to conduct its inspection by refusing to allow inspectors in,\nand denying them access to employees. It also said that US Stem Cell\nhad failed to establish proper quality control and sanitary\nstandards. The entire article related to FDA issues with stem cell clinics can\nbe found at the source URL above. - Mod.LL Byline: Sheila Kaplan, Denise Grady \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) Clearly scientifically inappropriate use of stem cells by\n\"unscrupulous\" clinics is occurring as discussed in the article above.\nThe posting of this on ProMED was precipitated by the report of the\nsmallpox vaccine, referred to as vaccinia, administered with stem\ncells by injecting directly into a tumor. The current vaccine\n\"ACAM2000\" is the same virus as the former \"Dryvax\" except that the\nvirus is grown in tissue culture rather than from inoculation of\ncalves. The only approved indication for the vaccine is to protect\nindividuals who are working with variations of the vaccinia vaccine in\nlaboratories and for military personnel or others who theoretically\ncould be exposed to smallpox as a biowarfare event. I recently immunized several dozen laboratory workers with ACAM2000\nrelated to work they will be doing with a recombinant vaccinia virus\nin an animal model. In order to obtain the vaccine, we had to fill out\na request form with a list of individuals to be immunized. As a\nreminder, the technique for immunization is \"scarification\" where a\nsmall amount of the reconstituted virus is introduced into the skin\nusing a bifurcated needle\n((https://jetinfectors.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/bifurcated-needle-1.jpg?w=401&h=261)).\nThe primary \"take\" is a vesicle/pustule developing about 7 days later\n(shown at\n(http://health.mo.gov/emergencies/ert/pdf/SmallpoxVaccinationReactions.pdf)).\nOne contraindication for use is in immunocompromised hosts (including\nsome patients with cancer) and the virus is never inoculated by other\ntechniques. More information about vaccination can be obtained from\nthe CDC at (https://www.cdc.gov/smallpox/vaccine-basics/index.html). Currently in press in Lancet Infectious Diseases, Clarissa Damaso from\nInstituto de Biofísica Carlos Chagas Filho, Universidade Federal do\nRio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil has written an excellent review\non the history of smallpox vaccines: Damaso CR: Revisiting Jenner's mysteries, the role of the Beaugency\nlymph in the evolutionary path of ancient smallpox vaccines. Lancet\nInfect Dis. 2017. pii: S1473-3099(17)30445-0. doi:\n10.1016/S1473-3099(17)30445-0; full text, references, and figures\navailable at\n(http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/laninf/PIIS1473-3099(17)30445-0.pdf): \"The origins of Jenner's vaccine have been intensively debated over\nthe years. British researcher Downie studied the close immunological\nrelationship of variola, cowpox, and vaccinia viruses, which led him\nto propose in 1951 that vaccinia virus had emerged from cowpox virus\nin the early years of vaccination (26). In 1965, Downie strongly\nopposed Peter Razzell's proposal that vaccinia virus had derived from\nan attenuated form of variola virus (27-29). Derrick Baxby (1940-2017)\nalso refuted Razzell's belief and proposed in 1981 that modern 20th\ncentury vaccines had derived from horsepox virus (30-32). In fact, we\ncurrently know that vaccinia virus is more closely related to horsepox\nvirus than to cowpox virus. On the basis of full-genome analysis and\nrecent phylogenetic inferences, horsepox virus is considered an\nancestor of the vaccinia lineage (33-36). Because all modern smallpox\nvaccine strains consist of vaccinia virus, one would expect that\nhorsepox virus, or even vaccinia virus, would be better candidates\nthan cowpox virus for the original source of Jenner's vaccine.\nAlthough an attractive hypothesis, the obscure history of cowpox,\nhorsepox, and vaccinia viruses further adds to the mystery. Since the\nmid-20th century, cows have been rarely found sick because of\ninfection by cowpox virus, and only felines, pet rodents, and zoo\nanimals, primarily in Europe, have been affected by the virus in the\npast decades (37-40). As for horsepox, the disease is rare and some\nbelieve it is extinct, at least in Europe (23,24,31,32,41). Only one\nexisting strain of horsepox virus obtained from Mongolian horses in\n1976 is currently known (33). However, vaccinia virus has never been\nfound naturally occurring in animals, except in India, where the\nstrain buffalopox infects buffaloes, and in Brazil, where the strain\nCantagalo (Cantagalo virus) infects dairy cows (2,42-44). In any case,\nall 3 orthopoxviruses cause zoonotic infections, and individuals\nacquire the infection when handling infected animals figures 2 and 3\n(2,22,37,40,45,46)\" \"The history and evolutionary relationships of the different smallpox\nvaccine strains remain obscure, because most strains and clonal\nvariants have not yet been completely sequenced. Historical and\nscientific evidence suggests that the Beaugency lymph lymph passed in\ncows by Chambon and Lanoix and, in October, 1866, they mixed this\nmaterial with lymph obtained from a 2nd natural case of cowpox\ndiscovered in Saint-Mandé, in the suburbs of Paris. The mixture was\nreferred to as the Beaugency lymph and was used subsequently by the\nAnimal Vaccine Institute as a seed to produce the vaccine\n(20,48,72,74) and horsepox virus made a strong contribution to the\ngenetic makeup of the existing vaccine strains, particularly those\nfrom continental Europe, USA, and Brazil. Evidence also suggests that\nthe Beaugency lymph was probably a vaccinia virus strain or a close\nancestor related to horsepox virus, and not a cowpox strain. Thus, it\nis reasonable to believe not only that cowpox virus was not used as a\nsmallpox vaccine in the 19th century, but that it might have never\nbeen used at all. Assumptions about the origins of the Beaugency lymph\nalso indicate that vaccinia virus was once a circulating virus in\nanimals in Europe in the 19th century, but later it disappeared and\nnow has no natural hosts, except in Brazil, India, and perhaps in\nEgypt, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal. Many questions still persist,\nand analysis of full-genome sequences of ancient vaccine strains would\nhelp unravel this fascinating medical mystery.\" - Mod.LL A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at:\n(http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106).

Fever was reported in the girl on 28 Aug 2017, the fever then disappeared but returned on 30 Aug 2017 when she was again hospitalized at Trento hospital. Malaria was diagnosed and treatment was started. On 2 Sep 2017 she was air-lifted to the University Hospital in Brescia with a diagnosis of cerebral malaria.   \n<br><br>Communicated by: EpiCore Global Surveillance Project (promed@promedmail.org)  ProMED-mail would like to thank all of the EpiCore members who responded to the request for more information on this event.   The overlap with the 2 cases from Burkina Faso was 5 days and thus infection would have had to have beeen through direct transmission by blood and not through mosquitoes. If the needle used for blood sugar testing in some manner was shared between the known malaria patients and the young girl who had been hospitalized for diabetes, then nosocomial transmission is a possibility.  An alternative possibility is that the infection occurred from local Italian mosquitoes that had been infected by an asymptomatic gametocyte carrier. This is well known to happen and malaria was endemic in northern Italy in the past especially in the period between both world wars when there was a high prevalence of the disease, but it was _P.vivax_ and not _P. falciparum_. Whether the local mosquitoes (_A. maculipennis_ complex) are capable of transmitting _P. falciparum_ malaria is not known, but the possibility is not excluded.  )From infection to the debut of symptoms, the incubation period is usually 7 - 10 days in non-immune individuals. If the hospitalization for the suspected diabetes mellitus in Portogruaro hospital was in fact when she presented with the 1st symptoms of malaria, then she was most likely infected 7 - 10 days previously, however, fever would have been a key presenting symptom.  Thus the key question is when did the 1st symptoms of malaria actually appear  and the only certain point in the information we presently have is that she was febrile on 28 Aug 2017.  There is a huge variability from the time the symptoms started to the time of death in imported (non-immune) malaria cases. A large study of 22 fatal outcomes of patient with _P. falciparum_ malaria returning to Switzerland (Christen et al. Am J Trop Med Hyg 2006;75:1188-94) reported an average of 8 days with a low of 3 days. Thus if the 1st symptoms of malaria were on 28 Aug 2017, the date of actual infection must have taken place within the 10 prior days.  Does the climate allow development of the malaria parasite in the mosquito? The average temperature for Trento in August 2017 is found here: (https://www.accuweather.com/en/it/trento/216357/august-weather/216357). The average night temperature is only reaching 20 C (approx. 68 F) on 18 Aug 2017, otherwise it was well below 20 C (approx. 68 F) with a low of 13 C (approx. 55 F). In order to allow _P.falciparum_ to develop in mosquitoes, the average night temperature must be 20 C (approx. 68 F) or more for 8 - 10 days. Thus the temperature in Trento in August 2017 excludes the possibility the 2 patients from Burkina Faso infected local mosquitoes, which then infected the patient.  The average temperature for Bibione in August 2017 is found here: (https://www.accuweather.com/en/it/bibione/2550920/august-weather/2550920). )From 1 Aug 2017 to 20 Aug 2017 the average night temperature was above 20 C approx. 68 F except for 2 days (12 and 13 Aug 2017) and thus the _P. falciparum_ parasite had the climatic conditions to develop in the mosquito if local mosquitoes are able to transmit _p. falciparum_ and were infected by a gametocyte carrier.  The risk of reintroducing malaria in Italy was discussed in Romi et al. in 2012 (Romi R et al. Probable autochthonous introduced malaria cases in Italy in 2009-2011 and the risk of local vector-borne transmission. Euro Surveill. 2012 Nov 29;17(48). pii: 20325). In Trento (Province of Trentino) the _Anopheles_ species in _A. maculipennis_ complex is present which is regarded as zoophilic (not preferring humans).  In conclusion, it is a possibility that the girl was infected by mosquitoes during her stay in Bibione, but nosocomial infection in Trento is an alternative explanation. - Mod.EP  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/75).

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness\nand disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE,\nAtay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral\nrehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and\nother forms of diarrhea: \"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that\ncholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement,\nand, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not\nuntil 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of\nthe intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could\nbe effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the\nintravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could\nbe just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for\nexample, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy\n(ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the\nmorbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1)\nhighlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn\nBangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per\ncent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as\n\"potentially the most important medical advance\" of the 20th century.\nA variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice\npowder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially\nzinc (5). \"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to\napproximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those\nwith severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously\nwith a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of\n20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg\nover the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser\ndegrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or\nrice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those\nwith no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with\nfrequent reevaluation. \"References\n-\n1.

The\nfollowing is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In:\nChronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract.\nGreydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in\npress): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons,\nvaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside\nof Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as\n60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection\nlengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:\n- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam;\n- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however,\nhave suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be\neffective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and\noutbreak situations (63, 64). \"References\n\n57.

This came about after 2\nkidney recipients in Taiwan were diagnosed with dengue 2 days after\nreceiving a kidney each from the same donor, said National Cheng Kung\nUniversity microbiology and immunology professor Dr Oscar Perng\nGuey-chuen. \"This indicates a potential risk,\" the Taiwan-based\nscientist said, adding that no dengue virus was detected in the\ndonor's blood. He said the donor contracted dengue in 2015 and in mid-2016, he died\nin an accident. His family donated his corneas, liver, heart, and\nkidneys. Both patients had the same strain of the dengue virus the\ndonor had in 2015 and one of the recipients died of dengue\nhaemorrhagic fever, he said. Asked where the virus could be hiding since it could not be detected\nin the blood, he said it was a question scientists are trying to\nanswer. Interestingly, those who received the donor's corneas, liver,\nand heart did not develop dengue, Dr Perng said on the sidelines of\nthe National Dengue And Arboviruses Infection Conference 2017\nyesterday 12 Aug 2017. He said although there was not enough\nevidence to show the virus came from the donor as the kidneys were not\ntested for dengue before the transplant, the same virus was found in\nthe patients' bodies after that. Dr Perng said his team had studied mice for dengue virus in the blood\ntestes, kidney, liver, spleen and brain, and found the virus present\nin the kidneys and brain. \"We believe the virus probably resided in\nthe kidneys and was not cleared by the body,\" he said, adding that the\nvirus could have been activated after transplant. He said this raised\nconcerns about asymptomatic people who are dengue carriers. Health Ministry deputy director, general Datuk Dr S Jeyaindran said\npatients with severe dengue would have better recovery if they were\ngiven colloids, a more concentrated fluid, at the early stage in fluid\nmanagement for dengue patients. Dr Jeyaindran, who was representing\nHealth Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam, said colloids may be\nintroduced at an earlier stage, instead of saline because it has not\nbeen successful in treating patients with severe dengue. He said more\nstudies will be conducted to find out at which stage the colloids\nshould be given. byline: Loh Foon Fong \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) - Air travel related spread of dengue.\nDate: Thu 3 Aug 2017.\nSource: Medical Xpress (edited)\n(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-08-air-responsible-dengue-asia.html) \nWhile the incidences of many other infectious diseases have declined\nover the past decade, the number of cases and outbreaks of dengue\nvirus have continued to increase. The spread of dengue to new areas is\nlikely due in large part to trends in air travel, researchers now\nreport in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Dengue virus affects as estimated 390 million people around the globe\neach year, and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild fever and\nheadache to severe low blood pressure. The virus has mostly caused\ndisease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, but a 2014\noutbreak in Japan broke that pattern. Overall, the geographic area\naffected by dengue has been growing in recent years. In the new work, Huaiyu Tian and Bing Xu, both of Beijing Normal\nUniversity, China, together with colleagues from the University of\nOxford and elsewhere analyzed the spread of dengue viruses in Asia\nfrom 1956 to 2015. They used 2202 genetic sequences of dengue viruses,\ncollected in 20 countries or regions of Asia over the 59 years, to\ndetermine how different strains were related. They also investigated\ntrends in air travel, maritime mobility, migration, and\nsocio-economics to determine what factors impact the spread of\ndengue. The spread of 3 different dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1, -2, and -3,\nis associated with air traffic more so than any other factors, the\ndata revealed. Air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India, the\nresearchers found, help seed dengue epidemics, while China, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, and Singapore help diffuse the virus to other Asian\ncountries. \"Future trends in global mobility could potentially accelerate the\nappearance and diffusion of DENV worldwide,\" the researchers say.\n\"Prevention and control of dengue epidemics requires a better\nunderstanding of its mode of geographic dissemination, especially for\ncountries in the tropics.\" Reference: Tian H, Sun Z, Faria NR, et al.

The meeting was attended by the national teams as well as the staff from the southern region of Afghanistan and Balochistan province of Pakistan.  - Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: Pakistan: 2 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) environmental positive samples; Syria: 6 new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases; and, DR Congo: 1 new cVDPV2 case. Additionally, pre-notification was received this week of a new WPV1 case from Karachi, Pakistan, the 1st in Karachi since January 2016. The case will be officially reflected in next week's global data reporting.  Afghanistan  - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 6. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 10 Jul 2017, from Zabul province, neighbouring Kandahar province and Pakistan. - Preparations continue for a targeted vaccination round in the southern region of the country, scheduled on 11 Sep 2017  Pakistan  - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week; the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 3. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 11 Jun 2017, from Killa Abdullah, Balochistan. - Two new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) environmental positive samples were reported in the past week, from Karachi, Sindh (collected on 7 and 12 Aug 2017). - Additionally, pre-notification was received this week of a new WPV1 case from Karachi, Pakistan. The case will be officially reflected in next week's global data reporting. Karachi had previously been a key reservoir for WPV1 in Pakistan. Analysis is ongoing to determine the origin of this latest case and a response is being planned. The case had onset of paralysis on 11 Aug 2017. The last previous case from Karachi is from January 2016. - The National Task Force for Polio Eradication convened last week, chaired by the Prime Minister of Pakistan and attended by the senior leadership from the national and provincial levels. The Task force reviewed the revised National Emergency Action Plan 2017/18 and discussed mechanisms of accelerating the implementation of strategies to stop WPV1 transmission in the key hot spots. - Under the National Emergency Action Plan for polio eradication, the country is planning to implement 2 nation-wide and 2 sub-national vaccination rounds from September to December 2017.  Nigeria - - No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 21 Aug 2016 in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno. - Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and cVDPV2 strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016). - Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance.  Lake Chad Basin  - The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno, Nigeria in 2016) and cVDPV2 (Borno and Sokoto provinces in Nigeria in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak. - Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.  Central Africa  - One new case of cVDPV2 was reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), from Haut Lomami province, with onset of paralysis on 20 Jun 2017. The total number of cVDPV2 cases this year 2017 is now 8, in 2 separate outbreaks: in Haut Lomami province (6 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on 20 Jun 2017); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on 26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017, with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May 2017). - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time. Outbreak response is taking place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols, targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 across the 2 provinces. \n- The 1st mOPV2 round was implemented on 27-29 Jun 2017 in the 2 affected provinces; and the 2nd mOPV2 round ran from 13-15 Jul 2017 in Haut Lomami and 20-22 Jul 2017 in Maniema. - Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.  Middle East  - In Syria, 6 new cases of cVDPV2 were officially reported in the past week from Deir-Ez-Zour governorate, bringing the total number of cases in this outbreak to 39. Onset of paralysis of these cases is between 3 Mar 2017 and 10 Jul 2017. The bulk of all cases are from Deir-Ez-Zour, the epicentre of this outbreak. - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized and implemented, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Two vaccination campaigns are planned for both Deir-Ez-Zour and Raqqa governorates. - The 1st mOPV2 round in Deir-Ez-Zour was successfully carried out between 22-26 Jul 2017. Independent post-campaign monitoring reflected coverage of 88.4 percent (based on caregiver recall). - The 2nd immunization round for Deir-Ez-Zor governorate started on 22 Aug 2017 and is ongoing. Monovalent OPV2 is being provided for children between 0-59 months of age, and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) for children 2-23 months. In addition to polio vaccines, Aqua Tabs are being provided to families for water purification - 2.5 tons of water purification tablets for 400 000 people have been disseminated at health centers. - Plans are being finalized to mitigate the risks of further spread from the outbreak zone to neighbouring areas and countries, including immunization of at-risk populations in northwest Syria, Turkey and Lebanon.

All confirmed cases to date have had onset of paralysis before 14 Jul 2017. - Final lab results are pending for an additional 5 poliovirus type-2 (PV2) isolates (3 from Mayadeen and 1 from Boukamal districts, Deir Ez-Zor governorate, and 1 from Thawra district, Raqqa governorate). - The 2nd immunization round for Deir Ez-Zor started on 22 Aug 2017 and is ongoing due to high levels of population movement in and out of the governorate during the round. - WHO has organized the redistribution of vaccines and mapping of population movements to increase reach. An additional 90 000 mOPV2 doses are being transported from Damascus to Deir Ez-Zor, to cater for population influxes from As-Sukhnah, Homs governorate, and Al-Qa'im in Iraq. Corrective measures are expected to extend the round by 2 days. - Preparations for the 2nd immunization round for Raqqa are underway. - The total number of AFP cases detected in Deir Ez-Zor governorate since the beginning of 2017 is 122 (91 from Mayadeen, 10 from Deir Ez-Zor, and 21 from Boukamal districts). Raqqa governorate has reported 16 AFP cases (5 from Raqqa, 10 from Tell Abyad, and 1 from Thawra districts). Homs governorate has reported 28 AFP cases (12 from Homs city, 13 from Rastan, 1 from Tadmour and 2 from Talkalakh districts).  more details on the vaccination activities and future plans are available at the source URL as well as the epidemic curve and graphic representation of the vaccination status of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis cases by governorate and district. - Mod.MPP   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  In the above global summary, there is still identified transmission ongoing in Pakistan as seen by the positive environmental sample in Karachi as well as the early report on a case of WPV1 associated disease in Karachi. It will be interesting to learn of the genetic profile of the environmental isolates in Karachi (from this past week as well as from a few weeks ago) and compare them with the newly identified WPV1 associated case in Karachi to see if they are genetically related.  There has been more activity associated with cVDPV2 in both Syria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), with 6 newly confirmed cases in Syria and 1 newly confirmed case in the DR Congo. According to the Situation Report in section <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> above, there are still 5 additional PV2 (poliovirus type 2) isolates in Syria undergoing final testing  4 from Deir al Zour and 1 from Raqqa. Hence there will probably be more cases confirmed in the coming days or weeks. I have not been able to identify similar report information from the DR Congo outbreak so it is not clear if the transmission has been interrupted leaving a total of 8 cases, or if there are still probable cases pending confirmation.

Mod.JG, edited (https://goo.gl/8k5UZP)   Last weekend, more than 20 children with severe respiratory symptoms were admitted to the Regional Hospital, and they were diagnosed with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection.  During the last week, 2 3-year-old children with severe respiratory illness were admitted to the intensive care unit, and one of them was waiting to be referred to Puerto Montt.  Therefore, with information updated until last Sat 26 Aug 2017, more than 30 children with RSV infection have been reported, and all of them are hospitalized in pediatrics, pediatric intensive care, and neonatal intensive care units. Meanwhile, because of the severity of their condition  most of them being infants  7 children have been referred to hospitals in Santiago and Concepcion so they may receive adequate care, since Coyhaique Regional Hospital (CRH) does not have a pediatric intensive care unit (ICU).  This is what Dr. Jaime Lopez-Quintana, Head of the CRH reported: \"This year 2017, RSV is behaving quite aggressively, and our adult intensive care unit is completely full with children. This is not an adequate condition for taking care of these children; this is not what our children in this region deserve,\" as he reported this situation to Ms. Gisela Alarcon-Rojas, Subsecretary of Healthcare Networks of the Chilean Ministry of Health, who verified the condition of children being taken care of in the (adult) ICU.  So, with this complex situation, Dr. Lopez-Quintana added that specialists from important children referral centers, particularly from Dr. Luis Calvo-Mackenna and Dr. Exequiel Fernandez-Cortes hospitals, will soon arrive to this region. \"We hope to have for the next 2 weeks the support of pediatricians trained in intensive medicine who may help the team we have here in Coyhaique,\" emphasized Dr. Lopez-Quintana.  According to information brought by the medical sub-direction from the Coyhaique Regional Hospital, the affected children are hospitalized in the following areas: pediatrics, neonatal intensive care unit, and (general) intensive care unit.  There are 10 infants hospitalized in the pediatrics service, while another 11 children have already been discharged; so now there are 14 beds available. In the neonatal ICU, 7 children are hospitalized; 2 of them are severely ill, and the capacity of the unit is 2 beds; while in the general ICU, 6 infants are hospitalized, and there are 2 beds available.  \"With respect to bed availability, the hospital is still able to cope with the situation. However, a working overload for the personnel has been observed, so that extra personnel have been recruited to cover the work shifts,\" explained Dr. Joaquin Garcia-Gay, Medical Subdirector of the CRH.  Also, Dr. Garcia-Gay explained that if a child develops a febrile illness, respiratory distress, intercostal retraction and malaise for 2 days, these are some of the symptoms that may indicate the presence of RSV, which mainly affects infants less than 2 years old.  \"So, if such symptoms occur, then the child must be brought to the Urgency Service. However, for those patients that develop mild respiratory symptoms, such as common cold or other similar conditions, it is preferable they are not brought to the Urgency Service, since they may be at risk for becoming infected with RSV from patients that are being hospitalized,\" the specialist advised.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  RSV is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections among young children worldwide. Most infants are infected before one year of age, and virtually everyone gets an RSV infection by 2 years of age.  Each year, on average, in the United States, RSV leads to: - 57 527 hospitalizations among children younger than 5 years old - 2.1 million outpatient visits among children younger than 5 years old - 177 000 hospitalizations and 14 000 deaths among adults older than 65 years.  In the United States and other areas with similar climates, RSV infections occur primarily during fall, winter, and spring (https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/research/us-surveillance.html). It is currently winter in Chile.  It is not clear what may have led to this current RSV outbreak in Chile. In 2001, an outbreak of RSV struck Santiago, Chile. 150 hospital admissions were registered daily during the height of the southern hemisphere winter. It was speculated that pollution may have played a role as Santiago is one of the world's most polluted cities. Chile's geography of surrounding mountains and heat inversions in winter dramatically increases the concentration of pollutants. Pollution leads to irritation of the respiratory tract making it more difficult for the immune system to respond to infections. (Excerpted from C Orellana.

Both cases are adults, 72 and 69 years of age, residents of rural\nlocalities in Collipulli. The 1st of these cases presented with\nintense abdominal pain and dehydration so the patient was sent from\nLonquimay Hospital to Victoria and from there to the Talcahuano\nBío-Bío region Hospital, where the individual remains\nhospitalized. The 2nd patient went to the Collipulli Hospital on Wed 30 Aug 2017\nwith a clinical picture of fever, headache, and sore throat, and from\nthere was taken to the Guillermo Grant Benavente Hospital in\nConcepción Bío-Bío region, where treatment was given.

Their\ninfections may have been acquired by exposure to rodent reservoir\nhosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta in his\nenvironment. Cases of human hantavirus infections occur fairly\nfrequently in the endemic region. Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region,\nthe hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This\nvirus is endemic in Chile, including the Araucanía region and cases\nof hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is\nrarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very\nclose physical contact, usually within the family.

This came about after 2\nkidney recipients in Taiwan were diagnosed with dengue 2 days after\nreceiving a kidney each from the same donor, said National Cheng Kung\nUniversity microbiology and immunology professor Dr Oscar Perng\nGuey-chuen. \"This indicates a potential risk,\" the Taiwan-based\nscientist said, adding that no dengue virus was detected in the\ndonor's blood. He said the donor contracted dengue in 2015 and in mid-2016, he died\nin an accident. His family donated his corneas, liver, heart, and\nkidneys. Both patients had the same strain of the dengue virus the\ndonor had in 2015 and one of the recipients died of dengue\nhaemorrhagic fever, he said. Asked where the virus could be hiding since it could not be detected\nin the blood, he said it was a question scientists are trying to\nanswer. Interestingly, those who received the donor's corneas, liver,\nand heart did not develop dengue, Dr Perng said on the sidelines of\nthe National Dengue And Arboviruses Infection Conference 2017\nyesterday 12 Aug 2017. He said although there was not enough\nevidence to show the virus came from the donor as the kidneys were not\ntested for dengue before the transplant, the same virus was found in\nthe patients' bodies after that. Dr Perng said his team had studied mice for dengue virus in the blood\ntestes, kidney, liver, spleen and brain, and found the virus present\nin the kidneys and brain. \"We believe the virus probably resided in\nthe kidneys and was not cleared by the body,\" he said, adding that the\nvirus could have been activated after transplant. He said this raised\nconcerns about asymptomatic people who are dengue carriers. Health Ministry deputy director, general Datuk Dr S Jeyaindran said\npatients with severe dengue would have better recovery if they were\ngiven colloids, a more concentrated fluid, at the early stage in fluid\nmanagement for dengue patients. Dr Jeyaindran, who was representing\nHealth Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam, said colloids may be\nintroduced at an earlier stage, instead of saline because it has not\nbeen successful in treating patients with severe dengue. He said more\nstudies will be conducted to find out at which stage the colloids\nshould be given. byline: Loh Foon Fong \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) - Air travel related spread of dengue.\nDate: Thu 3 Aug 2017.\nSource: Medical Xpress (edited)\n(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-08-air-responsible-dengue-asia.html) \nWhile the incidences of many other infectious diseases have declined\nover the past decade, the number of cases and outbreaks of dengue\nvirus have continued to increase. The spread of dengue to new areas is\nlikely due in large part to trends in air travel, researchers now\nreport in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Dengue virus affects as estimated 390 million people around the globe\neach year, and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild fever and\nheadache to severe low blood pressure. The virus has mostly caused\ndisease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, but a 2014\noutbreak in Japan broke that pattern. Overall, the geographic area\naffected by dengue has been growing in recent years. In the new work, Huaiyu Tian and Bing Xu, both of Beijing Normal\nUniversity, China, together with colleagues from the University of\nOxford and elsewhere analyzed the spread of dengue viruses in Asia\nfrom 1956 to 2015. They used 2202 genetic sequences of dengue viruses,\ncollected in 20 countries or regions of Asia over the 59 years, to\ndetermine how different strains were related. They also investigated\ntrends in air travel, maritime mobility, migration, and\nsocio-economics to determine what factors impact the spread of\ndengue. The spread of 3 different dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1, -2, and -3,\nis associated with air traffic more so than any other factors, the\ndata revealed. Air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India, the\nresearchers found, help seed dengue epidemics, while China, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, and Singapore help diffuse the virus to other Asian\ncountries. \"Future trends in global mobility could potentially accelerate the\nappearance and diffusion of DENV worldwide,\" the researchers say.\n\"Prevention and control of dengue epidemics requires a better\nunderstanding of its mode of geographic dissemination, especially for\ncountries in the tropics.\" Reference: Tian H, Sun Z, Faria NR, et al.

Changes to the zone, introduced last month July 2017, mean 10 of those additional properties are within the transmission zone, and 10 within the surveillance zone.  Bluetongue is an insect borne, non-contagious viral disease, and the changes mean properties affected will not be able to export to a number of markets that have restrictions in place, such as China and Turkey.  Peter Saville, senior veterinary officer in Alice Springs with the Department, said in his 14 years working in the area, the line was the lowest he had ever seen it.  \"What we found is that a number of properties north of the Alice Springs districts have had cattle which have seroconverted, which means that they've been exposed to the bluetongue virus, and those properties are much further south than they normally are.\"  Weather to blame According to Mr Saville, the change earlier in the year was due to a summer of high temperatures and high rainfall, resulting in the increased number of insects. \"It is insect movement that controls this, and as such there's not a lot we can do, so we just have to wait and see, we can't speculate on what might happen,\" he said.  Mr Saville said ownership changes could affect zoning.  \"One of the things that has contributed to this is a lot of properties have amalgamated their pics property identification codes because they're now under one ownership, and that means that even if part of their property is in a zone then the whole of the property is regarded as being in that zone.\"  Fluid line movement However Mr Saville said the line could once again move north depending on weather.  \"We wait until the end of summer, the end of the transmission season, and then we go out and test a number of properties to find out if there's been any evidence of viral activity.  \"Once those results are in, the NAMP National Arbovirus Monitoring Program committee meets and decides where the blue tongue line is going to go, and where the limits of the zones are.\"  Mr Saville said producers should visit the Animal Health Australia website if they want more information about the changes, and contact their livestock agent.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)   <br><br><strong>{2}</strong>. Date: Thu 30 Aug 2017. From: Mark Shipp (Mark.Schipp@agriculture.gov.au) (edited)   The National Arbovirus Monitoring Program (NAMP) maps areas in Australia where bluetongue virus transmission occurs, using both sentinel herds and additional sampling of herds when mustered.  Sentinel herds are bled and tested regularly, however in very remote areas where sentinel herds are not practical, cattle are sampled during the annual muster.  Bluetongue viral transmission occurs in parts of Australia but disease has not been reported.  There is a buffer zone between the zone where bluetongue virus transmission can occur and the zone free of bluetongue virus transmission. This is called the surveillance zone and is 50 Km 31.06 mi wide. The distance maintained between records of viral transmission and the boundary of the free zone is always maintained at a distance of 100 km 62.13 and follows property boundaries.  Yearly variation in the distribution of the main insect vector Culicoides brevitarisis means that the NAMP records some variation in the zone boundary from year to year. The map was most recently updated on Wed 16 Aug 2017. Detection of viral transmission immediately results in a zone expansion however zone contraction requires 2 years of negative surveillance results. The variations in the boundary are generally small and are considered routine. The NT example is confounded by changes in the management of land that have seen the amalgamation of properties. Because the zone boundary follows property boundaries this has exaggerated the zone extension. Property sizes can be extensive; up to 12 000 square km 4633.22 square miles in some cases.  There can be a lag period observed between viral transmission and antibody detection, particularly where surveillance is based on sampling mustered animals rather than sentinel herds. This maybe where the confusion has arisen in the quoted media report. Sero-conversion was detected in winter but arose from insect activity earlier in the season. The media report is inaccurate in relation to market access.  Recently negotiated conditions with China allow access for Australian feeder and slaughter cattle raised in areas where bluetongue virus transmission can occur. Parts of China record transmission of bluetongue virus year round and most of China (like parts of Australia) experiences times in the year where bluetongue viral transmission can occur (seasonal transmission).  The bulk of cattle in the Northern Territory are exported to markets that are endemic for bluetongue and while export conditions are applied, they are generally not trade restrictive.  The report of the zone expansion is publically available through the NAMP web site that is hosted on the Animal Health in Australia Web site.  It is certainly true that some markets require animals to be sourced from bluetongue virus free areas. This is the main reason that the NAMP program is maintained as it provides access for Australian cattle to these markets by confirming a zone free from viral transmission.  Objectives of the NAMP are: 1. Market access - to facilitate the export of live cattle, sheep and goats, and ruminant genetic material, to countries with concerns about bluetongue, Akabane and bovine ephemeral fever (BEF) viruses 2. Bluetongue early warning - to detect incursions of exotic strains of bluetongue virus (BTV) and vectors (Culicoides species biting midges) into Australia by surveillance of the northern BTV epidemic area. 3. Risk management - to detect changes in the seasonal distribution in Australia of endemic bluetongue, Akabane and BEF viruses and their vectors, to support livestock exporters.   Mark Schipp Chief Veterinary Officer (Australia) OIE Delegate (Australia) Vice-President OIE Assembly 7 London Cct, Canberra ACT 2600 GPO Box 858, Australia (mark.schipp@agriculture.gov.au)  In previous situations the line has been moved to reflect the seroconverstion, not actual disease discoveries. I reached out to Dr Schipp with some questions. Below are our question and answers:  ProMED-mail moderator (hence PMM): It appears this is a standard line movement based on seroconverstion - without actual disease? Could you clarify for me please?  Dr Schipp: Yes this is a regular adjustment of line to reflect seroconverstion with clinical disease.  PMM: Also the way this article is written is a bit confusing to me. As it is late August/1st of September, so I am thinking you may in late winter/early spring, yet the article above talks about frosts in the winter?  Dr Schipp: The hope expressed by Dr Saville is that the frosts currently being experienced in the central Austral winter will deplete the number of _Culicoides_ able to over winter to then become abundant in the spring and summer.  ProMED-mail thanks Dr Schipp for his promt reply and for taking the time to clarify issues regarding the surveillance line.  Information for understanding Bluetongue. Bluetongue virus (BTV) can and does affect cattle.  The disease is caused by an orbivirus belonging to the family _Reoviridae_. There are 25 serotypes of bluetongue virus and 10 of these have been isolated in Australia. Orbiviruses are insect-borne viruses (arboviruses) transmitted by _Culicoides_ midges. Many other non bluetongue orbiviruses are also endemic in Australia.  Bluetongue is an insect-borne, viral disease that can affect sheep, goats, deer, and cattle. Sheep are the most seriously affected species; clinical disease and mortalities occur and production and trade losses may result. Most infections in cattle are unapparent.  A number of bluetongue serotypes are present in Australia, but the severe clinical disease seen in other countries has not occurred here. Disease has been produced in experimentally infected sheep with some serotypes present in Australia.  Bluetongue virus serotype 1 was 1st identified in Australia in 1975 from trapped insects in the Northern Territory (NT) but despite its long-term presence, it has not caused any clinical disease. Since that time 9 more serotypes have been isolated in the NT. The distribution of BTV in Australia has been monitored in the National Arbovirus Monitoring Program (NAMP) for many years and the zones of BTV virus transmission and freedom are mapped and updated regularly on the Animal Health Australia website. - Mod.TG  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/292).

The meeting was attended by the national teams as well as the staff from the southern region of Afghanistan and Balochistan province of Pakistan.  - Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: Pakistan: 2 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) environmental positive samples; Syria: 6 new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases; and, DR Congo: 1 new cVDPV2 case. Additionally, pre-notification was received this week of a new WPV1 case from Karachi, Pakistan, the 1st in Karachi since January 2016. The case will be officially reflected in next week's global data reporting.  Afghanistan  - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 6. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 10 Jul 2017, from Zabul province, neighbouring Kandahar province and Pakistan. - Preparations continue for a targeted vaccination round in the southern region of the country, scheduled on 11 Sep 2017  Pakistan  - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week; the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 3. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 11 Jun 2017, from Killa Abdullah, Balochistan. - Two new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) environmental positive samples were reported in the past week, from Karachi, Sindh (collected on 7 and 12 Aug 2017). - Additionally, pre-notification was received this week of a new WPV1 case from Karachi, Pakistan. The case will be officially reflected in next week's global data reporting. Karachi had previously been a key reservoir for WPV1 in Pakistan. Analysis is ongoing to determine the origin of this latest case and a response is being planned. The case had onset of paralysis on 11 Aug 2017. The last previous case from Karachi is from January 2016. - The National Task Force for Polio Eradication convened last week, chaired by the Prime Minister of Pakistan and attended by the senior leadership from the national and provincial levels. The Task force reviewed the revised National Emergency Action Plan 2017/18 and discussed mechanisms of accelerating the implementation of strategies to stop WPV1 transmission in the key hot spots. - Under the National Emergency Action Plan for polio eradication, the country is planning to implement 2 nation-wide and 2 sub-national vaccination rounds from September to December 2017.  Nigeria - - No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 21 Aug 2016 in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno. - Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and cVDPV2 strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016). - Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance.  Lake Chad Basin  - The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno, Nigeria in 2016) and cVDPV2 (Borno and Sokoto provinces in Nigeria in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak. - Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.  Central Africa  - One new case of cVDPV2 was reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), from Haut Lomami province, with onset of paralysis on 20 Jun 2017. The total number of cVDPV2 cases this year 2017 is now 8, in 2 separate outbreaks: in Haut Lomami province (6 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on 20 Jun 2017); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on 26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017, with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May 2017). - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time. Outbreak response is taking place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols, targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 across the 2 provinces. \n- The 1st mOPV2 round was implemented on 27-29 Jun 2017 in the 2 affected provinces; and the 2nd mOPV2 round ran from 13-15 Jul 2017 in Haut Lomami and 20-22 Jul 2017 in Maniema. - Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.  Middle East  - In Syria, 6 new cases of cVDPV2 were officially reported in the past week from Deir-Ez-Zour governorate, bringing the total number of cases in this outbreak to 39. Onset of paralysis of these cases is between 3 Mar 2017 and 10 Jul 2017. The bulk of all cases are from Deir-Ez-Zour, the epicentre of this outbreak. - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized and implemented, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Two vaccination campaigns are planned for both Deir-Ez-Zour and Raqqa governorates. - The 1st mOPV2 round in Deir-Ez-Zour was successfully carried out between 22-26 Jul 2017. Independent post-campaign monitoring reflected coverage of 88.4 percent (based on caregiver recall). - The 2nd immunization round for Deir-Ez-Zor governorate started on 22 Aug 2017 and is ongoing. Monovalent OPV2 is being provided for children between 0-59 months of age, and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) for children 2-23 months. In addition to polio vaccines, Aqua Tabs are being provided to families for water purification - 2.5 tons of water purification tablets for 400 000 people have been disseminated at health centers. - Plans are being finalized to mitigate the risks of further spread from the outbreak zone to neighbouring areas and countries, including immunization of at-risk populations in northwest Syria, Turkey and Lebanon.

All confirmed cases to date have had onset of paralysis before 14 Jul 2017. - Final lab results are pending for an additional 5 poliovirus type-2 (PV2) isolates (3 from Mayadeen and 1 from Boukamal districts, Deir Ez-Zor governorate, and 1 from Thawra district, Raqqa governorate). - The 2nd immunization round for Deir Ez-Zor started on 22 Aug 2017 and is ongoing due to high levels of population movement in and out of the governorate during the round. - WHO has organized the redistribution of vaccines and mapping of population movements to increase reach. An additional 90 000 mOPV2 doses are being transported from Damascus to Deir Ez-Zor, to cater for population influxes from As-Sukhnah, Homs governorate, and Al-Qa'im in Iraq. Corrective measures are expected to extend the round by 2 days. - Preparations for the 2nd immunization round for Raqqa are underway. - The total number of AFP cases detected in Deir Ez-Zor governorate since the beginning of 2017 is 122 (91 from Mayadeen, 10 from Deir Ez-Zor, and 21 from Boukamal districts). Raqqa governorate has reported 16 AFP cases (5 from Raqqa, 10 from Tell Abyad, and 1 from Thawra districts). Homs governorate has reported 28 AFP cases (12 from Homs city, 13 from Rastan, 1 from Tadmour and 2 from Talkalakh districts).  more details on the vaccination activities and future plans are available at the source URL as well as the epidemic curve and graphic representation of the vaccination status of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis cases by governorate and district. - Mod.MPP   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  In the above global summary, there is still identified transmission ongoing in Pakistan as seen by the positive environmental sample in Karachi as well as the early report on a case of WPV1 associated disease in Karachi. It will be interesting to learn of the genetic profile of the environmental isolates in Karachi (from this past week as well as from a few weeks ago) and compare them with the newly identified WPV1 associated case in Karachi to see if they are genetically related.  There has been more activity associated with cVDPV2 in both Syria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), with 6 newly confirmed cases in Syria and 1 newly confirmed case in the DR Congo. According to the Situation Report in section <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> above, there are still 5 additional PV2 (poliovirus type 2) isolates in Syria undergoing final testing  4 from Deir al Zour and 1 from Raqqa. Hence there will probably be more cases confirmed in the coming days or weeks. I have not been able to identify similar report information from the DR Congo outbreak so it is not clear if the transmission has been interrupted leaving a total of 8 cases, or if there are still probable cases pending confirmation.

Source: Pajhwok Afghan News (edited) (https://www.pajhwok.com/en/2017/08/28/congo-virus-kills-13-infects-42-herat)   Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has killed 13 people in western Herat province this year 2017, with another 42 being treated for the deadly virus, according to officials.  CCHF is a viral disease. Symptoms may include fever, muscle pains, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding into the skin. The CCHF virus is typically spread by tick bites or contact with livestock carrying the disease.  Health officials in Herat advised people to be careful these days due to increased interaction with livestock in the wake of Eidul Adha Sacrifice Feast; 31 Aug-4 Sep 2017, when Muslims across the globe slaughter millions of animals.  Public health director in Herat Abdul Hakim Tamana said many people lost their lives to the Congo virus in the province this year 2017. He said 55 Congo cases were registered in the civil hospital since late March and of the patients, 13 had died. The deceased included 7 men and 6 women, he added.  Tamana said the virus spread from animals and people slaughtering animals should wear gloves.  A livestock farmer, who has contracted Congo virus, said: \"When I slaughtered the sheep, its blood covered my hands and later I started falling sick.\"  Ahmad Khalil Waez, animal healthcare director, said citizens should be careful while slaughtering animals to avoid contracting the Congo virus. He said a butcher should used special glasses, coat, gloves, mask, and shoes while slaughtering the animal.  People mainly contract the CCHF virus from infected ticks or contact with infected animal blood and tissue.  There are no vaccines available to immunize animals but precautionary measures include disinfection of livestock pens, submerging livestock in solutions for decontamination, and meat packaging safeguards.  The virus has had a presence in neighbouring Iran where the virus killed 3 people in 2015.  According to the World Health Organization, CCHF's mortality rate is about 30 percent and is endemic to Africa, the Balkans and Ukraine, the Middle East, and Central Asia.  CCHF was first detected in the Crimea in 1944 and then in the Congo in 1969. In 2011, it was detected for the first time in ticks in Spain.  Byline: Storai Karimi   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  In 2008, a major outbreak was reported in Herat City, western Afghanistan, with approximately 60 suspected and 6 confirmed cases. Later, a cross-sectional seroprevalence survey was conducted among livestock-owning households in the same districts of Herat City where the outbreak had occurred, which showed that IgG seroprevalence was 11.2 and 75.0 percent in humans (n = 330) and livestock (n = 132), respectively ((https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3310665/)).  In 2016, 66 cases had been reported by 7 Sep, with 12 deaths ((http://www.emro.who.int/afg/afghanistan-news/cchf-eid.html)). CCHF virus has been observed in over 30 countries, including in Africa (Democratic Republic of Congo, South Africa, Nigeria, Senegal, Uganda, Tanzania, Mauritania, Kenya), Asia (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, China), the Middle East (Iran, Iraq, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman), and southeastern Europe (the Russian Federation, Bulgaria, Albania, Kosovo, Turkey, Greece, and Spain) ((https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23458713)).  People most at risk of contracting CCHF include animal herders, livestock workers, butchers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Healthcare workers are also at risk of infection through unprotected contact with infectious blood and body fluids while caring for patients. There is no vaccine available for either people or animals, which means prevention is crucial. - Mod.UBA  Maps of Afghanistan can be seen at (http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/afghanistan_admin-2009.jpg) and (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1757). - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ  ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Republic of Congo":{"158":{"title":"Poliomyelitis update (23): global (Syria, Pakistan, DR Congo)\r\n\tWPV1, cVDPV2 ","date":["31","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Poliomyelitis update (23): global (Syria, Pakistan, DR Congo)\r\n\tWPV1, cVDPV2 [EXTERNAL]","summary":" A ProMED-mail post (http://www.promedmail.org) ProMED-mail is a program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases (http://www.isid.org)  In this update: <br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Global - Polio Eradication Initiative <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Syria - WHO Situation Report   <br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Global - Polio Eradication Initiative.

Corrective measures are expected to extend the round by 2 days. - Preparations for the 2nd immunization round for Raqqa are underway. - The total number of AFP cases detected in Deir Ez-Zor governorate since the beginning of 2017 is 122 (91 from Mayadeen, 10 from Deir Ez-Zor, and 21 from Boukamal districts). Raqqa governorate has reported 16 AFP cases (5 from Raqqa, 10 from Tell Abyad, and 1 from Thawra districts). Homs governorate has reported 28 AFP cases (12 from Homs city, 13 from Rastan, 1 from Tadmour and 2 from Talkalakh districts).  more details on the vaccination activities and future plans are available at the source URL as well as the epidemic curve and graphic representation of the vaccination status of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis cases by governorate and district. - Mod.MPP   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  In the above global summary, there is still identified transmission ongoing in Pakistan as seen by the positive environmental sample in Karachi as well as the early report on a case of WPV1 associated disease in Karachi. It will be interesting to learn of the genetic profile of the environmental isolates in Karachi (from this past week as well as from a few weeks ago) and compare them with the newly identified WPV1 associated case in Karachi to see if they are genetically related.  There has been more activity associated with cVDPV2 in both Syria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), with 6 newly confirmed cases in Syria and 1 newly confirmed case in the DR Congo. According to the Situation Report in section <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> above, there are still 5 additional PV2 (poliovirus type 2) isolates in Syria undergoing final testing  4 from Deir al Zour and 1 from Raqqa. Hence there will probably be more cases confirmed in the coming days or weeks. I have not been able to identify similar report information from the DR Congo outbreak so it is not clear if the transmission has been interrupted leaving a total of 8 cases, or if there are still probable cases pending confirmation.

Source: Pajhwok Afghan News (edited) (https://www.pajhwok.com/en/2017/08/28/congo-virus-kills-13-infects-42-herat)   Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has killed 13 people in western Herat province this year 2017, with another 42 being treated for the deadly virus, according to officials.  CCHF is a viral disease. Symptoms may include fever, muscle pains, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding into the skin. The CCHF virus is typically spread by tick bites or contact with livestock carrying the disease.  Health officials in Herat advised people to be careful these days due to increased interaction with livestock in the wake of Eidul Adha Sacrifice Feast; 31 Aug-4 Sep 2017, when Muslims across the globe slaughter millions of animals.  Public health director in Herat Abdul Hakim Tamana said many people lost their lives to the Congo virus in the province this year 2017. He said 55 Congo cases were registered in the civil hospital since late March and of the patients, 13 had died. The deceased included 7 men and 6 women, he added.  Tamana said the virus spread from animals and people slaughtering animals should wear gloves.  A livestock farmer, who has contracted Congo virus, said: \"When I slaughtered the sheep, its blood covered my hands and later I started falling sick.\"  Ahmad Khalil Waez, animal healthcare director, said citizens should be careful while slaughtering animals to avoid contracting the Congo virus. He said a butcher should used special glasses, coat, gloves, mask, and shoes while slaughtering the animal.  People mainly contract the CCHF virus from infected ticks or contact with infected animal blood and tissue.  There are no vaccines available to immunize animals but precautionary measures include disinfection of livestock pens, submerging livestock in solutions for decontamination, and meat packaging safeguards.  The virus has had a presence in neighbouring Iran where the virus killed 3 people in 2015.  According to the World Health Organization, CCHF's mortality rate is about 30 percent and is endemic to Africa, the Balkans and Ukraine, the Middle East, and Central Asia.  CCHF was first detected in the Crimea in 1944 and then in the Congo in 1969. In 2011, it was detected for the first time in ticks in Spain.  Byline: Storai Karimi   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  In 2008, a major outbreak was reported in Herat City, western Afghanistan, with approximately 60 suspected and 6 confirmed cases. Later, a cross-sectional seroprevalence survey was conducted among livestock-owning households in the same districts of Herat City where the outbreak had occurred, which showed that IgG seroprevalence was 11.2 and 75.0 percent in humans (n = 330) and livestock (n = 132), respectively ((https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3310665/)).  In 2016, 66 cases had been reported by 7 Sep, with 12 deaths ((http://www.emro.who.int/afg/afghanistan-news/cchf-eid.html)). CCHF virus has been observed in over 30 countries, including in Africa (Democratic Republic of Congo, South Africa, Nigeria, Senegal, Uganda, Tanzania, Mauritania, Kenya), Asia (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, China), the Middle East (Iran, Iraq, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman), and southeastern Europe (the Russian Federation, Bulgaria, Albania, Kosovo, Turkey, Greece, and Spain) ((https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23458713)).  People most at risk of contracting CCHF include animal herders, livestock workers, butchers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Healthcare workers are also at risk of infection through unprotected contact with infectious blood and body fluids while caring for patients. There is no vaccine available for either people or animals, which means prevention is crucial. - Mod.UBA  Maps of Afghanistan can be seen at (http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/afghanistan_admin-2009.jpg) and (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1757). - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ  ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Costa Rica":{"297":{"title":"Dengue/DHF update (11): Americas","date":["28","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Dengue/DHF update (11): Americas","summary":"\nDENGUE/DHF UPDATE (11): AMERICAS\n\nA ProMED-mail post\n(http://www.promedmail.org)\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n(http://www.isid.org) In this update:\nCases in various countries:\nAmericas regional\n\nCases in various countries not mentioned above or more recent case\nnumbers.

The total amount of dead wild boars discovered in the woods around\nZlín, in the far east of the Czech Republic, stood at 94 at the end\nof August 2017. In this month, 23 new infected carcasses were found,\nwhich is a downward trend from July 2017, when 68 reports were sent\nto the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). The 1st report of\nASF in Czech wild boars was on Wed 21 Jun 2017. Many neighbouring countries have alerted their local pig producers to\nbe very careful what to feed their pigs - and their inhabitants what\nto purchase and how to dispose of it. So did Slovakia, according to\nthe Slovak Spectator. Zlín is only a few km away from the western\nSlovak border, to its north is Poland where ASF has been around since\n2014 and on its eastern border is Ukraine, where ASF has been\nconfirmed since 2011. In a presentation, given in mid-July 2017 to the European\nCommission's Standing Committee On Animals, Plants, Food and Feed\n(SCoPAFF), Dr Petr Šatrán of the Czech State Veterinary\nAdministration indicated that human activities are most likely the\ncause of the spread of the virus, seeing that the nearest reported\ncases of ASF were roughly 500 km 310.68 mi away and that the\npositive dead wild boars were found in inhabited areas. In the other country where ASF was found for the 1st time in 2017,\nRomania, things appear relatively quiet. News broke early this month\nAugust 2017 that ASF was also found on 2 backyard farms in the north\nof the country. Ever since, the Romanian authorities did not report\nany further outbreaks of ASF to the OIE. Of all other countries in the European Union, especially Poland has\ncontinued to report outbreaks of African Swine Fever in smaller and\nmiddle-sized operations. In August alone, on 23 farm sites of various\nsizes, ASF was found to have infected at least one animal, after which\nthe entire herd would have to be culled. The biggest operation in this respect was a farm near Monki, Podlaskie\nprovince, where all remaining 431 pigs had to be culled after 11 had\ndied as a result of ASF, on Sat 19 Aug 2017. Noteworthy as well was\nthe ASF-related closure of 2 farms in Lack, Lubelskie province, in\nearly August. These farms had 136 and 141 pigs respectively see also\nitem 2.

This was said by Poland's Minister of Agriculture,\nKrzysztof Yurgel, Niezalezna reports. As reported, the length of the fence will be 729 km 452.98 mi,\ncosting Poland 130 million zloties (more than 36.2 million USD). The\nfinal decision on a fence will be made within the next 3 weeks. According to experts, ASF has developed in the territory of Poland\n\"thanks to\" the wild boars who entered from Belarus. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) The accumulated ASF OIE data from Poland as of Thu 31 Aug 2017, are\nas follows (start of event 22 May 2014):\nNumber of follow-up reports: 189\nTotal outbreaks: 550 (Submitted)\nSpecies/ Susceptible/ Cases/ Deaths/ Killed and disposed of/\nSlaughtered\nWild boar/ - / 620 / 620 / 0 / 0\nDomestic Swine/ 6303/ 402/ 188/ 6097/ 0 A map showing ASF cases reported globally to the OIE since 1 Jan 2017,\nas of Thu 31 Aug 2017, is available at (http://tinyurl.com/ybexasqm).\nClick on the European cluster, zoom in to each of the countries of\ninterest. EU disease control measures require designation of risk areas as Part\nI (wild boar at risk, but no cases found), Part II (wild boar testing\npositive but no spill over into domestic pigs), Part III (cases in\nwild boar and occasional spill over into domestic pigs) and Part IV\nwhich concerns the island of Sardinia only. Consignments of live pigs,\nlive wild boars, meat of either source and animal by-products of\neither source are only allowed under certain derogations. For a full\nexplanation, see European Commission Implementing Decision\n2014/708/EU. ASF, a viral disease against which no vaccine has become available so\nfar, is currently threatening central and western Europe, where dense\npopulations of wild boar are present. According to a recent update of DEFRA (UK) ASF situation assessment,\nthe continuing cases in the Czech Republic, the spread in Poland which\nappears to be due to several breakdowns in biosecurity and the new\noutbreaks in Romania are \"concerning\". This signifies a spread in\ngeographic distribution, a possible drop in biosecurity awareness and\ntherefore an increase in the weight of infection in East Europe. Despite the relatively low level of trade in live pigs, there could be\na substantial movement of people, vehicles and personal imports of\npork products, therefore the risk of ASF introduction to the UK has\nbeen raised from \"very low\" (that is, \"rare but could occur\") to\n\"low\". The Russian veterinary watchdog Rosselkhoznadzor believes ASF will\nkeep moving west via 2 main pathways. The southerly route, has already\nseen the virus spread from Ukraine to Moldova. Russian vets believe it\ncould penetrate central Romania, then move to the Balkans, including\nBulgaria and Serbia. On the northern route, now that ASF has been found in the Czech\nRepublic, Rosselkhoznadzor believes, if it gains a foothold, it is\nlikely to head further west, with Germany next in the firing line. The\nsaid is included in a recent update by the Russian journalist\nVladislav Vorotnikov, available at\n(http://www.pig-world.co.uk/comment/where-next-for-african-swine-fever.html).\n- Mod.AS ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Denmark":{"130":{"title":"E. coli EHEC - Australia: (QL) O157, mild disease, mutant\r\n\ttoxin, 2013 ","date":["29","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH/EDR> E. coli EHEC - Australia: (QL) O157, mild disease, mutant\r\n\ttoxin, 2013 [EXTERNAL]","summary":" A ProMED-mail post (http://www.promedmail.org) ProMED-mail is a program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases (http://www.isid.org) .

LL) is a major cause of serious human gastrointestinal illness and have the potential to cause life-threatening complications, such as hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) (1). An average of 0.4 cases of EHEC illness per 100 000 persons per year are reported to public health authorities in Australia (2). Disease severity can range from asymptomatic infection to serious and sometimes fatal illness, particularly in young children and the elderly (3,4).  Healthy ruminants, particularly cattle, are the reservoir for EHEC (5). Human infection with EHEC usually occurs as a result of inadvertent ingestion of fecal matter after consumption of contaminated food, water, or unpasteurized milk; contact with animals or their environments; or secondarily, through contact with infected humans (4,5). In the largest previously reported outbreak of EHEC illness in Australia in 1995, which was associated with consumption of mettwurst (uncooked, semidry, fermented sausages), HUS developed in 23 of the 51 case-patients identified, and there was 1 death (6).  The Study  A multidisciplinary incident management team was established to investigate an outbreak of EHEC illness associated with an annual agricultural show in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, in August 2013. The incident management team defined primary and secondary outbreak cases. Persons with laboratory-confirmed EHEC infection associated with the outbreak and their household contacts were followed up until the point of microbiological evidence of clearance, which was defined as 2 consecutive negative stool samples collected more than 24h apart (7).  Case-patients and contacts with a high risk for transmission (persons under 5 years of age; persons unable to maintain good hygiene; or childcare, healthcare, aged care, or food preparation workers) were advised to avoid childcare and work settings in accordance with Queensland Health Guidelines (7). Enhanced surveillance measures were implemented to assist with case finding. Medical practitioners were requested to avoid use of antimicrobial drugs for suspected case-patients with EHEC infections because of previously reported associations between antimicrobial drug use and HUS. We developed a case-control study to obtain additional information related to animal contact, hand hygiene, and food consumption at the agricultural show. We analyzed data by using Epi Info 7 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA). EHEC identified from human, environmental, and animal samples were serotyped for O and H antigens. Expression of Shiga toxin 1 (stx1) and stx2 genes was determined for selected isolates. Shiga toxin gene subtyping and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis was performed.  During 21 Aug 2013 to 27 Sep 2013, we identified 57 outbreak-associated laboratory-confirmed case-patients with EHEC infection: 54 confirmed primary case-patients, 1 probable primary case-patient, and 2 secondary case-patients (Figure 1 for figures, see original URL - Mod. LL). Of the 57 cases-patients, 32 (56 percent) were female. Case-patients ranged in age from 1 to 77 (median 9) years; 31 (56 percent) case-patients were (10 years of age. Median incubation period after attending the agricultural show was 4 (range 1-11, 25th-75th percentile 3-5) days. Case-patients reported diarrhea (96 percent), abdominal pain (93 percent), bloody diarrhea (41 percent), and fever (32 percent) (Table 1). A total of 7 case-patients were hospitalized. No cases of HUS or deaths were reported.  Public Health Units followed up 40 case-patients until microbiological evidence of clearance; the remaining case-patients were lost to follow up. Median duration of EHEC excretion among primary case-patients was 18 (range 2-52) days (Table 2). After 27 days and 6 recurrent stools positive for EHEC, and after acute diarrheal illness had resolved, 1 child was given azithromycin on day 40 for 3 days to hasten decolonization. 2 consecutive stool specimens obtained more than 48 h after treatment with antimicrobial drugs was stopped were negative for EHEC in this child. This patient did not have any adverse effects from azithromycin treatment.  A total of 45 of 55 primary case-patients and 28 household contacts who attended the agricultural show were included in the case-control study. Median age of case-patients was 8 (range 1-77) years, and median age of controls was 38 (range 1-70) years. We showed by using univariate analysis that case-patients were not more likely than controls to have entered the animal nursery at the show. Case-patients were more likely than controls to have had contact with lambs or goats, fed the animals, or had their hands licked by animals.  We identified the same multilocus variable number tandem repeat and stx subtype genotype of _E. coli_ O157:H- in human case-patients, animal bedding from the animal nursery before disposal, and fecal samples collected from lambs, goats, and calves. WGS and read mapping to an _E. coli_ O157 reference genome showed that of the human, animal, and environmental isolates analyzed, all contained an IS1203v insertion that resulted in deletion of the first 494 bp of the stx2c subunit A gene (Figure 2). Expression of stx2 was not detected in these isolates by Immunocard STAT! EHEC (Meridian Bioscience, Cincinnati, OH, USA) and Shiga toxin Quik Chek (Alere, Waltham, MA, USA) lateral flow devices. No additional stx2 genes were identified, and no disruptions were detected in the stx1 gene regions of any of the isolates.  Conclusions  We found that EHEC infection was associated with feeding lambs or goats, feeding animals, and having the hands licked by animals. The course of _E. coli_ O157 infection was relatively mild; no cases of HUS were associated with this outbreak. Heiman et al. found that of 4928 cases of 390 _E. coli_ O157 illness outbreaks in the USA during 2003-2012, HUS was detected in 299 cases (6 percent of illnesses) (8). HUS cases with stx1+/stx2 _E. coli_ O157 isolates have been reported (9,10). We speculate that the absence of severe complications in this outbreak might have been caused, in part, by disruption of the stx2 subunit A gene by the IS1203v insertion, which resulted in lack of expression or a nonfunctional Stx2 toxin.  The proportion of case-patients reporting bloody diarrhea (19/46, 41 percent) was also lower than previously reported. Ethelberg et al. reported that 69 percent (56/81) of case-patients in Denmark infected with _E. coli_ O157 had bloody diarrhea (11). A recent retrospective cohort study reported that 61 percent (2027/3323) of symptomatic case-patients infected with _E. coli_ O157 Public Health England had bloody diarrhea. Bloody diarrhea was reported to be a risk factor for HUS (odds ratio 2.10; p = 0.001) (12). In the outbreak we studied, children under 5 years of age were less likely than older children and adults to report bloody diarrhea. EHEC infection should be actively considered for young children with non-bloody diarrhea who were exposed to potential sources of EHEC.  In this outbreak, 1 child was given azithromycin for 3 days to hasten decolonization some weeks after the acute diarrheal illness had resolved. Antimicrobial drugs are generally not recommended to hasten EHEC decolonization because of major associations with HUS (13). Recommendations to avoid high risk activities (such as childcare attendance) might place a major socioeconomic burden on EHEC carriers and their families. Further studies are required to assess whether WGS can provide useful information for safe administration of antimicrobial drugs for treatment of acute illness caused by EHEC, or when chronic shedding becomes established.  Our comprehensive study of a large outbreak _E. coli_ O157 illness, characterized by an IS1203v insertion disrupting the stx2c subunit A gene, showed mild clinical illness and an absence of HUS. Further characterization by virulence studies on isolates with this stx2c subunit A gene disruption might provide further insights into the mild illness caused by this strain.  References - 1.

It may well be the case that the IS1203v insertion that resulted in deletion of the first 494 bp of the stx2c subunit A gene may have been the cause of milder illness. Regarding azithromycin use, azithromycin and the carbapenem antimicrobial class are among a small group of antibacterials that do not appear to precipitate a higher risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome. Azithromycin was used for late clearance of the EHEC here and I have had anecdotal experience doing the same thing in an asymptomatic chronic carrier of EHEC O157 without any adverse effects. - Mod.LL  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/285).

The isolate from the product was almost identical by\nwhole genome sequencing to isolates from 3 of 4 patients, whose food\nhistory in 3 of the patients identified the smoked salmon as the\nlikely source. The smoked salmon product was recalled from about 600 stores in\nDenmark and a limited number in Metro Poland. Up to 3 of the 4 patients had become ill in the same week in August\n2017 and the 4th had become ill in May 2017. One of the 4 patients has\ndied. All 4 patients had severe underlying disease. DSG consists of chains (fotex, Bilka, Netto, and Salling) with more\nthan 1400 stores in Denmark, Germany, Poland and Sweden. Refrigerated smoked salmon is a recognized potential source for\nlisteriosis, similar to other cold cut meats and non-heat treated\ncured smoked meats, being a ready-to-eat product that does not require\nfurther cooking before eating. The news report said that more cases\nrelated to this outbreak were expected, despite the recall, as the\nincubation period for listeriosis is up to 3 weeks actually symptoms\ncan start up to as 70 days after exposure. - Mod.ML A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at:\n(http://healthmap.org/promed/p/113).

The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare is advising tourists to go to hospital if they develop a high fever or generalized rash after returning to Japan.  Although the World Health Organization verified that Japan has eliminated infections of endemic measles strains in 2015, group infections originating from people who contracted the disease abroad are spreading in the country. As of 6 Aug 2017, the number of patients reached 169 this year in Japan, already eclipsing the figure in the previous year.  About 4100 patients in Italy and around 6500 patients in Romania have already been confirmed as of August 2017 compared with about 860 and 2000, respectively, throughout 2016, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.  Symptoms of the highly contagious disease include runny nose, red and watery eyes, high fever, and rash. The virus is spread through coughing and sneezing and can cause complications such as pneumonia and can even result in death in one in 1000 patients, according to the ministry. The ministry recommends people traveling overseas to check their vaccination records and take an additional shot if they have only been vaccinated once.  The disease was prevalent about a decade ago in Japan with the number of patients soaring to over 10 000 in 2008 but the country was later considered as free from infections of the virus.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Japan can be found at (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/156). - Mod.LK   <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Australia (Perth, Western Australia): ex Italy.

Large measles outbreak introduced by asylum seekers and spread among the insufficiently vaccinated resident population, Berlin, October 2014 to August 2015. Euro Surveill. 2017; 22(34): pii=30599 - Abstract  The largest measles outbreak in Berlin since 2001 occurred from October 2014 to August 2015. Overall, 1344 cases were ascertained, 86 per cent (with available information) unvaccinated, including 146 (12 per cent) asylum seekers. Median age was 17 years (interquartile range: 4-29 years), 26 per cent were hospitalised and a 1 year old child died. Measles virus genotyping uniformly revealed the variant 'D8-Rostov-Don' and descendants. The virus was likely introduced by and initially spread among asylum seekers before affecting Berlin's resident population. Among Berlin residents, the highest incidence was in children younger than 2 years, yet most cases (52 per cent) were adults. Post-exposure vaccinations in homes for asylum seekers, not always conducted, occurred later (median: 7.5 days) than the recommended 72 hours after onset of the 1st case and reached only half of potential contacts. Asylum seekers should not only have non-discriminatory, equitable access to vaccination, they also need to be offered measles vaccination in a timely fashion, that is, immediately upon arrival in the receiving country. Supplementary immunisation activities targeting the resident population, particularly adults, are urgently needed in Berlin.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail.

Source: Romania Insider (edited) (https://www.romania-insider.com/measles-kills-iraqi-refugee/)   The ongoing measles outbreak keeps making victims in Romania. A 10 month old girl, who was a refugee from Iraq, became the 33rd person to die of the infection, reports local Digi24. The girl arrived in Romania on 7 Jul 2017 with her family, and the doctors diagnosed her with measles in August. They also discovered that the child was suffering from malnutrition and severe psychomotor retardation.  The measles outbreak is still a major problem in Romania, with more than 8900 cases reported across the country until 25 Aug 2017, including 33 deaths, according to data from the National Center for Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases (CNSCBT). Most deaths were registered in Timis (9), Dolj (7), and Arad (6) counties.  Measles is a highly contagious respiratory infection caused by a virus. It causes a total-body skin rash and flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough, and runny nose. According to information posted on WHO's website, the virus is highly contagious, spreading by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact, and direct contact with infected nasal or throat secretions. Unvaccinated young children pose the highest risk of measles and its complications, including death.  The Romanian Government adopted earlier this month August 2017 a draft bill on the organization and financing of population vaccination (https://www.romania-insider.com/romania-draft-bill-vaccination/). The project was sent to the Parliament for approval and could come into force in January 2018.  byline: Irina Marica   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Measles tends to be more severe in children who are malnourished, especially children who are also vitamin A deficient. And complications are commoner and more serious in malnourished children. Because of complications such as diarrhoea, measles may lead to failure to thrive. Infection with measles virus may lead to kwashiorkor or marasmus in children who are underweight at the time that they get infected. Therefore, measles may result in, or aggravate, malnutrition.

Date: Sat 26 Aug 2017. Source: News-Medical/Life Sciences (edited) (https://www.news-medical.net/news/20170826/New-study-highlights-role-played-by-demographics-in-the-spread-of-measles.aspx)   Even if the incidence of measles infection has decreased by at least 90 per cent worldwide since the introduction of the vaccine, measles is still one of the major causes of death in children among vaccine-preventable diseases. Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world.  A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries.  Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years.  \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\"  \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea\".  The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years 2 million DALYs since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln 13 million DALYs in the US, and 36-mln 36 million DALYs in Ethiopia.  \"Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,\" continues Prof Melegaro \"our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population. Tailoring immunization campaigns to achieve measles eradication goals is essential and currently, for some countries, this means considering also the role of unprotected adolescents and young adults.\"   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Reference - Trentini F, Poletti P, Merler S, Melegaro A.

This came about after 2\nkidney recipients in Taiwan were diagnosed with dengue 2 days after\nreceiving a kidney each from the same donor, said National Cheng Kung\nUniversity microbiology and immunology professor Dr Oscar Perng\nGuey-chuen. \"This indicates a potential risk,\" the Taiwan-based\nscientist said, adding that no dengue virus was detected in the\ndonor's blood. He said the donor contracted dengue in 2015 and in mid-2016, he died\nin an accident. His family donated his corneas, liver, heart, and\nkidneys. Both patients had the same strain of the dengue virus the\ndonor had in 2015 and one of the recipients died of dengue\nhaemorrhagic fever, he said. Asked where the virus could be hiding since it could not be detected\nin the blood, he said it was a question scientists are trying to\nanswer. Interestingly, those who received the donor's corneas, liver,\nand heart did not develop dengue, Dr Perng said on the sidelines of\nthe National Dengue And Arboviruses Infection Conference 2017\nyesterday 12 Aug 2017. He said although there was not enough\nevidence to show the virus came from the donor as the kidneys were not\ntested for dengue before the transplant, the same virus was found in\nthe patients' bodies after that. Dr Perng said his team had studied mice for dengue virus in the blood\ntestes, kidney, liver, spleen and brain, and found the virus present\nin the kidneys and brain. \"We believe the virus probably resided in\nthe kidneys and was not cleared by the body,\" he said, adding that the\nvirus could have been activated after transplant. He said this raised\nconcerns about asymptomatic people who are dengue carriers. Health Ministry deputy director, general Datuk Dr S Jeyaindran said\npatients with severe dengue would have better recovery if they were\ngiven colloids, a more concentrated fluid, at the early stage in fluid\nmanagement for dengue patients. Dr Jeyaindran, who was representing\nHealth Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam, said colloids may be\nintroduced at an earlier stage, instead of saline because it has not\nbeen successful in treating patients with severe dengue. He said more\nstudies will be conducted to find out at which stage the colloids\nshould be given. byline: Loh Foon Fong \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) - Air travel related spread of dengue.\nDate: Thu 3 Aug 2017.\nSource: Medical Xpress (edited)\n(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-08-air-responsible-dengue-asia.html) \nWhile the incidences of many other infectious diseases have declined\nover the past decade, the number of cases and outbreaks of dengue\nvirus have continued to increase. The spread of dengue to new areas is\nlikely due in large part to trends in air travel, researchers now\nreport in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Dengue virus affects as estimated 390 million people around the globe\neach year, and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild fever and\nheadache to severe low blood pressure. The virus has mostly caused\ndisease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, but a 2014\noutbreak in Japan broke that pattern. Overall, the geographic area\naffected by dengue has been growing in recent years. In the new work, Huaiyu Tian and Bing Xu, both of Beijing Normal\nUniversity, China, together with colleagues from the University of\nOxford and elsewhere analyzed the spread of dengue viruses in Asia\nfrom 1956 to 2015. They used 2202 genetic sequences of dengue viruses,\ncollected in 20 countries or regions of Asia over the 59 years, to\ndetermine how different strains were related. They also investigated\ntrends in air travel, maritime mobility, migration, and\nsocio-economics to determine what factors impact the spread of\ndengue. The spread of 3 different dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1, -2, and -3,\nis associated with air traffic more so than any other factors, the\ndata revealed. Air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India, the\nresearchers found, help seed dengue epidemics, while China, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, and Singapore help diffuse the virus to other Asian\ncountries. \"Future trends in global mobility could potentially accelerate the\nappearance and diffusion of DENV worldwide,\" the researchers say.\n\"Prevention and control of dengue epidemics requires a better\nunderstanding of its mode of geographic dissemination, especially for\ncountries in the tropics.\" Reference: Tian H, Sun Z, Faria NR, et al.

All 4 dengue serotypes are\npresent this year 2017. A total of 15 samples found to be\nco-infected. In an earlier study done in New Delhi, such multiple\ndengue serotype infections were reported in only 19 per cent of cases.\nAll 4 dengue serotypes were detected in almost equal number in blood\nsamples, unlike in an earlier study conducted in New Delhi wherein one\nserotype was found to be dominating. This has been indicated as a\npossible reason for the high prevalence of infection due to more than\none dengue serotype. Another finding of concern is that DEN-4 strain,\nresembling the one detected in Pune in 2009, was detected in as many\nas 11 samples. DEN-4 is associated with unusual symptoms like\nrespiratory distress, pleural effusion, and elevated levels of liver\nenzymes. Also, detection of a DEN-1 strain found closely related to a\nstrain from Thailand detected in 1980 that causes high severity\ninfection has been reported.

This came about after 2\nkidney recipients in Taiwan were diagnosed with dengue 2 days after\nreceiving a kidney each from the same donor, said National Cheng Kung\nUniversity microbiology and immunology professor Dr Oscar Perng\nGuey-chuen. \"This indicates a potential risk,\" the Taiwan-based\nscientist said, adding that no dengue virus was detected in the\ndonor's blood. He said the donor contracted dengue in 2015 and in mid-2016, he died\nin an accident. His family donated his corneas, liver, heart, and\nkidneys. Both patients had the same strain of the dengue virus the\ndonor had in 2015 and one of the recipients died of dengue\nhaemorrhagic fever, he said. Asked where the virus could be hiding since it could not be detected\nin the blood, he said it was a question scientists are trying to\nanswer. Interestingly, those who received the donor's corneas, liver,\nand heart did not develop dengue, Dr Perng said on the sidelines of\nthe National Dengue And Arboviruses Infection Conference 2017\nyesterday 12 Aug 2017. He said although there was not enough\nevidence to show the virus came from the donor as the kidneys were not\ntested for dengue before the transplant, the same virus was found in\nthe patients' bodies after that. Dr Perng said his team had studied mice for dengue virus in the blood\ntestes, kidney, liver, spleen and brain, and found the virus present\nin the kidneys and brain. \"We believe the virus probably resided in\nthe kidneys and was not cleared by the body,\" he said, adding that the\nvirus could have been activated after transplant. He said this raised\nconcerns about asymptomatic people who are dengue carriers. Health Ministry deputy director, general Datuk Dr S Jeyaindran said\npatients with severe dengue would have better recovery if they were\ngiven colloids, a more concentrated fluid, at the early stage in fluid\nmanagement for dengue patients. Dr Jeyaindran, who was representing\nHealth Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam, said colloids may be\nintroduced at an earlier stage, instead of saline because it has not\nbeen successful in treating patients with severe dengue. He said more\nstudies will be conducted to find out at which stage the colloids\nshould be given. byline: Loh Foon Fong \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) - Air travel related spread of dengue.\nDate: Thu 3 Aug 2017.\nSource: Medical Xpress (edited)\n(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-08-air-responsible-dengue-asia.html) \nWhile the incidences of many other infectious diseases have declined\nover the past decade, the number of cases and outbreaks of dengue\nvirus have continued to increase. The spread of dengue to new areas is\nlikely due in large part to trends in air travel, researchers now\nreport in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Dengue virus affects as estimated 390 million people around the globe\neach year, and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild fever and\nheadache to severe low blood pressure. The virus has mostly caused\ndisease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, but a 2014\noutbreak in Japan broke that pattern. Overall, the geographic area\naffected by dengue has been growing in recent years. In the new work, Huaiyu Tian and Bing Xu, both of Beijing Normal\nUniversity, China, together with colleagues from the University of\nOxford and elsewhere analyzed the spread of dengue viruses in Asia\nfrom 1956 to 2015. They used 2202 genetic sequences of dengue viruses,\ncollected in 20 countries or regions of Asia over the 59 years, to\ndetermine how different strains were related. They also investigated\ntrends in air travel, maritime mobility, migration, and\nsocio-economics to determine what factors impact the spread of\ndengue. The spread of 3 different dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1, -2, and -3,\nis associated with air traffic more so than any other factors, the\ndata revealed. Air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India, the\nresearchers found, help seed dengue epidemics, while China, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, and Singapore help diffuse the virus to other Asian\ncountries. \"Future trends in global mobility could potentially accelerate the\nappearance and diffusion of DENV worldwide,\" the researchers say.\n\"Prevention and control of dengue epidemics requires a better\nunderstanding of its mode of geographic dissemination, especially for\ncountries in the tropics.\" Reference: Tian H, Sun Z, Faria NR, et al.

The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare is advising tourists to go to hospital if they develop a high fever or generalized rash after returning to Japan.  Although the World Health Organization verified that Japan has eliminated infections of endemic measles strains in 2015, group infections originating from people who contracted the disease abroad are spreading in the country. As of 6 Aug 2017, the number of patients reached 169 this year in Japan, already eclipsing the figure in the previous year.  About 4100 patients in Italy and around 6500 patients in Romania have already been confirmed as of August 2017 compared with about 860 and 2000, respectively, throughout 2016, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.  Symptoms of the highly contagious disease include runny nose, red and watery eyes, high fever, and rash. The virus is spread through coughing and sneezing and can cause complications such as pneumonia and can even result in death in one in 1000 patients, according to the ministry. The ministry recommends people traveling overseas to check their vaccination records and take an additional shot if they have only been vaccinated once.  The disease was prevalent about a decade ago in Japan with the number of patients soaring to over 10 000 in 2008 but the country was later considered as free from infections of the virus.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Japan can be found at (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/156). - Mod.LK   <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Australia (Perth, Western Australia): ex Italy.

Large measles outbreak introduced by asylum seekers and spread among the insufficiently vaccinated resident population, Berlin, October 2014 to August 2015. Euro Surveill. 2017; 22(34): pii=30599 - Abstract  The largest measles outbreak in Berlin since 2001 occurred from October 2014 to August 2015. Overall, 1344 cases were ascertained, 86 per cent (with available information) unvaccinated, including 146 (12 per cent) asylum seekers. Median age was 17 years (interquartile range: 4-29 years), 26 per cent were hospitalised and a 1 year old child died. Measles virus genotyping uniformly revealed the variant 'D8-Rostov-Don' and descendants. The virus was likely introduced by and initially spread among asylum seekers before affecting Berlin's resident population. Among Berlin residents, the highest incidence was in children younger than 2 years, yet most cases (52 per cent) were adults. Post-exposure vaccinations in homes for asylum seekers, not always conducted, occurred later (median: 7.5 days) than the recommended 72 hours after onset of the 1st case and reached only half of potential contacts. Asylum seekers should not only have non-discriminatory, equitable access to vaccination, they also need to be offered measles vaccination in a timely fashion, that is, immediately upon arrival in the receiving country. Supplementary immunisation activities targeting the resident population, particularly adults, are urgently needed in Berlin.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail.

A 10 month old girl, who was a refugee from Iraq, became the 33rd person to die of the infection, reports local Digi24. The girl arrived in Romania on 7 Jul 2017 with her family, and the doctors diagnosed her with measles in August. They also discovered that the child was suffering from malnutrition and severe psychomotor retardation.  The measles outbreak is still a major problem in Romania, with more than 8900 cases reported across the country until 25 Aug 2017, including 33 deaths, according to data from the National Center for Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases (CNSCBT). Most deaths were registered in Timis (9), Dolj (7), and Arad (6) counties.  Measles is a highly contagious respiratory infection caused by a virus. It causes a total-body skin rash and flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough, and runny nose. According to information posted on WHO's website, the virus is highly contagious, spreading by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact, and direct contact with infected nasal or throat secretions. Unvaccinated young children pose the highest risk of measles and its complications, including death.  The Romanian Government adopted earlier this month August 2017 a draft bill on the organization and financing of population vaccination (https://www.romania-insider.com/romania-draft-bill-vaccination/). The project was sent to the Parliament for approval and could come into force in January 2018.  byline: Irina Marica   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Measles tends to be more severe in children who are malnourished, especially children who are also vitamin A deficient. And complications are commoner and more serious in malnourished children. Because of complications such as diarrhoea, measles may lead to failure to thrive. Infection with measles virus may lead to kwashiorkor or marasmus in children who are underweight at the time that they get infected. Therefore, measles may result in, or aggravate, malnutrition.

Source: News-Medical/Life Sciences (edited) (https://www.news-medical.net/news/20170826/New-study-highlights-role-played-by-demographics-in-the-spread-of-measles.aspx)   Even if the incidence of measles infection has decreased by at least 90 per cent worldwide since the introduction of the vaccine, measles is still one of the major causes of death in children among vaccine-preventable diseases. Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world.  A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries.  Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years.  \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\"  \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea\".  The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years 2 million DALYs since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln 13 million DALYs in the US, and 36-mln 36 million DALYs in Ethiopia.  \"Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,\" continues Prof Melegaro \"our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population. Tailoring immunization campaigns to achieve measles eradication goals is essential and currently, for some countries, this means considering also the role of unprotected adolescents and young adults.\"   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Reference - Trentini F, Poletti P, Merler S, Melegaro A.

In addition to H5N8, 2 other HPAI subtypes have been detected in\nEurope, i.e. HPAI H5N5 (in 7 states) and H5N6 (in Greece). Outside\nEurope, avian influenza outbreaks of the subtype HPAI H5N8 have been\nreported from Russia, Israel, Egypt, Tunisia, Nigeria, Uganda,\nCameroon, Iran, Nepal, and India. HPAI H5N1 is endemic in Asia and\nsome African countries. Moreover, further HPAIV H5N1 related\nH5-strains are circulating in Asia. Although the current epidemic seems to be waning, isolated outbreaks\nmay still occur. The recent reports of HPAIV cases in birds kept in\ncaptivity, which occurred in May 2017, indicate that, at least in some\ncountries, infectious virus is still circulating in the environment.\nTherefore, biosecurity measures should be maintained. These include,\ninter alia, wearing of stable specific protective clothing and\nfootwear, cleaning and disinfection of equipment that has been in\ncontact with birds, and the best possible prevention of contacts\nbetween poultry and wild birds. So far and worldwide, none of the HPAIV subtypes circulating in Europe\n(H5N8, H5N5, and H5N6) have caused infections in humans;\"\n(https://www.fli.de/en/news/animal-disease-situation/avian-influenza-ai-fowl-plague/).\n- Mod.CRD A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at:\n(http://healthmap.org/promed/p/101).

The total amount of dead wild boars discovered in the woods around\nZlín, in the far east of the Czech Republic, stood at 94 at the end\nof August 2017. In this month, 23 new infected carcasses were found,\nwhich is a downward trend from July 2017, when 68 reports were sent\nto the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). The 1st report of\nASF in Czech wild boars was on Wed 21 Jun 2017. Many neighbouring countries have alerted their local pig producers to\nbe very careful what to feed their pigs - and their inhabitants what\nto purchase and how to dispose of it. So did Slovakia, according to\nthe Slovak Spectator. Zlín is only a few km away from the western\nSlovak border, to its north is Poland where ASF has been around since\n2014 and on its eastern border is Ukraine, where ASF has been\nconfirmed since 2011. In a presentation, given in mid-July 2017 to the European\nCommission's Standing Committee On Animals, Plants, Food and Feed\n(SCoPAFF), Dr Petr Šatrán of the Czech State Veterinary\nAdministration indicated that human activities are most likely the\ncause of the spread of the virus, seeing that the nearest reported\ncases of ASF were roughly 500 km 310.68 mi away and that the\npositive dead wild boars were found in inhabited areas. In the other country where ASF was found for the 1st time in 2017,\nRomania, things appear relatively quiet. News broke early this month\nAugust 2017 that ASF was also found on 2 backyard farms in the north\nof the country. Ever since, the Romanian authorities did not report\nany further outbreaks of ASF to the OIE. Of all other countries in the European Union, especially Poland has\ncontinued to report outbreaks of African Swine Fever in smaller and\nmiddle-sized operations. In August alone, on 23 farm sites of various\nsizes, ASF was found to have infected at least one animal, after which\nthe entire herd would have to be culled. The biggest operation in this respect was a farm near Monki, Podlaskie\nprovince, where all remaining 431 pigs had to be culled after 11 had\ndied as a result of ASF, on Sat 19 Aug 2017. Noteworthy as well was\nthe ASF-related closure of 2 farms in Lack, Lubelskie province, in\nearly August. These farms had 136 and 141 pigs respectively see also\nitem 2.

This was said by Poland's Minister of Agriculture,\nKrzysztof Yurgel, Niezalezna reports. As reported, the length of the fence will be 729 km 452.98 mi,\ncosting Poland 130 million zloties (more than 36.2 million USD). The\nfinal decision on a fence will be made within the next 3 weeks. According to experts, ASF has developed in the territory of Poland\n\"thanks to\" the wild boars who entered from Belarus. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) The accumulated ASF OIE data from Poland as of Thu 31 Aug 2017, are\nas follows (start of event 22 May 2014):\nNumber of follow-up reports: 189\nTotal outbreaks: 550 (Submitted)\nSpecies/ Susceptible/ Cases/ Deaths/ Killed and disposed of/\nSlaughtered\nWild boar/ - / 620 / 620 / 0 / 0\nDomestic Swine/ 6303/ 402/ 188/ 6097/ 0 A map showing ASF cases reported globally to the OIE since 1 Jan 2017,\nas of Thu 31 Aug 2017, is available at (http://tinyurl.com/ybexasqm).\nClick on the European cluster, zoom in to each of the countries of\ninterest. EU disease control measures require designation of risk areas as Part\nI (wild boar at risk, but no cases found), Part II (wild boar testing\npositive but no spill over into domestic pigs), Part III (cases in\nwild boar and occasional spill over into domestic pigs) and Part IV\nwhich concerns the island of Sardinia only. Consignments of live pigs,\nlive wild boars, meat of either source and animal by-products of\neither source are only allowed under certain derogations. For a full\nexplanation, see European Commission Implementing Decision\n2014/708/EU. ASF, a viral disease against which no vaccine has become available so\nfar, is currently threatening central and western Europe, where dense\npopulations of wild boar are present. According to a recent update of DEFRA (UK) ASF situation assessment,\nthe continuing cases in the Czech Republic, the spread in Poland which\nappears to be due to several breakdowns in biosecurity and the new\noutbreaks in Romania are \"concerning\". This signifies a spread in\ngeographic distribution, a possible drop in biosecurity awareness and\ntherefore an increase in the weight of infection in East Europe. Despite the relatively low level of trade in live pigs, there could be\na substantial movement of people, vehicles and personal imports of\npork products, therefore the risk of ASF introduction to the UK has\nbeen raised from \"very low\" (that is, \"rare but could occur\") to\n\"low\". The Russian veterinary watchdog Rosselkhoznadzor believes ASF will\nkeep moving west via 2 main pathways. The southerly route, has already\nseen the virus spread from Ukraine to Moldova. Russian vets believe it\ncould penetrate central Romania, then move to the Balkans, including\nBulgaria and Serbia. On the northern route, now that ASF has been found in the Czech\nRepublic, Rosselkhoznadzor believes, if it gains a foothold, it is\nlikely to head further west, with Germany next in the firing line.

This came about after 2\nkidney recipients in Taiwan were diagnosed with dengue 2 days after\nreceiving a kidney each from the same donor, said National Cheng Kung\nUniversity microbiology and immunology professor Dr Oscar Perng\nGuey-chuen. \"This indicates a potential risk,\" the Taiwan-based\nscientist said, adding that no dengue virus was detected in the\ndonor's blood. He said the donor contracted dengue in 2015 and in mid-2016, he died\nin an accident. His family donated his corneas, liver, heart, and\nkidneys. Both patients had the same strain of the dengue virus the\ndonor had in 2015 and one of the recipients died of dengue\nhaemorrhagic fever, he said. Asked where the virus could be hiding since it could not be detected\nin the blood, he said it was a question scientists are trying to\nanswer. Interestingly, those who received the donor's corneas, liver,\nand heart did not develop dengue, Dr Perng said on the sidelines of\nthe National Dengue And Arboviruses Infection Conference 2017\nyesterday 12 Aug 2017. He said although there was not enough\nevidence to show the virus came from the donor as the kidneys were not\ntested for dengue before the transplant, the same virus was found in\nthe patients' bodies after that. Dr Perng said his team had studied mice for dengue virus in the blood\ntestes, kidney, liver, spleen and brain, and found the virus present\nin the kidneys and brain. \"We believe the virus probably resided in\nthe kidneys and was not cleared by the body,\" he said, adding that the\nvirus could have been activated after transplant. He said this raised\nconcerns about asymptomatic people who are dengue carriers. Health Ministry deputy director, general Datuk Dr S Jeyaindran said\npatients with severe dengue would have better recovery if they were\ngiven colloids, a more concentrated fluid, at the early stage in fluid\nmanagement for dengue patients. Dr Jeyaindran, who was representing\nHealth Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam, said colloids may be\nintroduced at an earlier stage, instead of saline because it has not\nbeen successful in treating patients with severe dengue. He said more\nstudies will be conducted to find out at which stage the colloids\nshould be given. byline: Loh Foon Fong \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) - Air travel related spread of dengue.\nDate: Thu 3 Aug 2017.\nSource: Medical Xpress (edited)\n(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-08-air-responsible-dengue-asia.html) \nWhile the incidences of many other infectious diseases have declined\nover the past decade, the number of cases and outbreaks of dengue\nvirus have continued to increase. The spread of dengue to new areas is\nlikely due in large part to trends in air travel, researchers now\nreport in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Dengue virus affects as estimated 390 million people around the globe\neach year, and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild fever and\nheadache to severe low blood pressure. The virus has mostly caused\ndisease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, but a 2014\noutbreak in Japan broke that pattern. Overall, the geographic area\naffected by dengue has been growing in recent years. In the new work, Huaiyu Tian and Bing Xu, both of Beijing Normal\nUniversity, China, together with colleagues from the University of\nOxford and elsewhere analyzed the spread of dengue viruses in Asia\nfrom 1956 to 2015. They used 2202 genetic sequences of dengue viruses,\ncollected in 20 countries or regions of Asia over the 59 years, to\ndetermine how different strains were related. They also investigated\ntrends in air travel, maritime mobility, migration, and\nsocio-economics to determine what factors impact the spread of\ndengue. The spread of 3 different dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1, -2, and -3,\nis associated with air traffic more so than any other factors, the\ndata revealed. Air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India, the\nresearchers found, help seed dengue epidemics, while China, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, and Singapore help diffuse the virus to other Asian\ncountries. \"Future trends in global mobility could potentially accelerate the\nappearance and diffusion of DENV worldwide,\" the researchers say.\n\"Prevention and control of dengue epidemics requires a better\nunderstanding of its mode of geographic dissemination, especially for\ncountries in the tropics.\" Reference: Tian H, Sun Z, Faria NR, et al.

As a precautionary measure, as many as 100 blood samples of horses have been taken so far and sent for testing.  The infectious disease is caused by a bacterium which spreads from animal to animal. Humans who come in contact with the affected animals can also contract this disease. There are 6000 horses and other equines in the district. The detection of the disease has spread panic among owners.  Giving details, deputy chief veterinary officer Yogendra Panwar said, \"In 2011, some 5 horses were diagnosed with this disease in Chandpur area of Bijnor district. They were put to sleep to save other equines. Since then, our department has been running a drive in this regard to make horse owners aware about this disease. We have been taking blood samples of horses repeatedly in the district. Last month July 2017, 2 horses were diagnosed with Glanders in Najibabad area. Both horses had to be killed by a team of veterinary doctors..\"  The veterinary officer explained since there is no known treatment or vaccine for Glanders, an animal that tests positive is put to sleep to prevent the disease from spreading. It is a fatal disease. Government compensates the equine owner after killing a sick animal. The compensation for horses and mules range from Rs 16 000 to Rs 25 000 USD 250.00 to 390.00 he added.  byline: Harveer Dabas   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  India and Brazil are known to lead the list of countries where glanders, a zoonotic, OIE-listed equids disease, is endemic. Media reports on cases of the traditionally fearsome glanders, are often published by the Indian press. This is not fully reflected in India's official reports to the OIE. According to the recent ones, the annual numbers of recorded glanders outbreaks (in equidae) countrywide were as follows: 2010 - 1; 2011 - 3; 2012 - 1; 2013 - 1; 2014 - 0; 2015 - 5. During the 1st semester of 2016, 9 outbreaks were reported, involving 45 cases of which 36 died. India's OIE semi-annual report for the period Jul-Dec 2016 is not yet available.  No statistics on the incidence of glanders in humans in India could be obtained.  Glanders is a contagious and fatal disease of horses, donkeys, and mules, caused by infection with the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_. The pathogen causes nodules and ulcerations in the upper respiratory tract and lungs. A skin form also occurs, known as 'farcy'. Control of glanders requires testing of suspect clinical cases, screening of apparently normal equids, and elimination of reactors. _B. mallei_ can be transmitted to humans, but such cases, which were known to be often fatal, have become rather uncommon (see ref 1). In view of its zoonotic potential, all infected or contaminated (or potentially infected or contaminated) material must be handled in a laboratory with appropriate biosafety and biosecurity controls following a biorisk analysis.  The above and additional information on glanders, its causative agent and its diagnosis is available at (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.05.11_GLANDERS.pdf). A useful updated review on the disease, including its recent global distribution, is available in ref 1.  No vaccine against this disease is available.

This came about after 2\nkidney recipients in Taiwan were diagnosed with dengue 2 days after\nreceiving a kidney each from the same donor, said National Cheng Kung\nUniversity microbiology and immunology professor Dr Oscar Perng\nGuey-chuen. \"This indicates a potential risk,\" the Taiwan-based\nscientist said, adding that no dengue virus was detected in the\ndonor's blood. He said the donor contracted dengue in 2015 and in mid-2016, he died\nin an accident. His family donated his corneas, liver, heart, and\nkidneys. Both patients had the same strain of the dengue virus the\ndonor had in 2015 and one of the recipients died of dengue\nhaemorrhagic fever, he said. Asked where the virus could be hiding since it could not be detected\nin the blood, he said it was a question scientists are trying to\nanswer. Interestingly, those who received the donor's corneas, liver,\nand heart did not develop dengue, Dr Perng said on the sidelines of\nthe National Dengue And Arboviruses Infection Conference 2017\nyesterday 12 Aug 2017. He said although there was not enough\nevidence to show the virus came from the donor as the kidneys were not\ntested for dengue before the transplant, the same virus was found in\nthe patients' bodies after that. Dr Perng said his team had studied mice for dengue virus in the blood\ntestes, kidney, liver, spleen and brain, and found the virus present\nin the kidneys and brain. \"We believe the virus probably resided in\nthe kidneys and was not cleared by the body,\" he said, adding that the\nvirus could have been activated after transplant. He said this raised\nconcerns about asymptomatic people who are dengue carriers. Health Ministry deputy director, general Datuk Dr S Jeyaindran said\npatients with severe dengue would have better recovery if they were\ngiven colloids, a more concentrated fluid, at the early stage in fluid\nmanagement for dengue patients. Dr Jeyaindran, who was representing\nHealth Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam, said colloids may be\nintroduced at an earlier stage, instead of saline because it has not\nbeen successful in treating patients with severe dengue. He said more\nstudies will be conducted to find out at which stage the colloids\nshould be given. byline: Loh Foon Fong \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) - Air travel related spread of dengue.\nDate: Thu 3 Aug 2017.\nSource: Medical Xpress (edited)\n(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-08-air-responsible-dengue-asia.html) \nWhile the incidences of many other infectious diseases have declined\nover the past decade, the number of cases and outbreaks of dengue\nvirus have continued to increase. The spread of dengue to new areas is\nlikely due in large part to trends in air travel, researchers now\nreport in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Dengue virus affects as estimated 390 million people around the globe\neach year, and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild fever and\nheadache to severe low blood pressure. The virus has mostly caused\ndisease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, but a 2014\noutbreak in Japan broke that pattern. Overall, the geographic area\naffected by dengue has been growing in recent years. In the new work, Huaiyu Tian and Bing Xu, both of Beijing Normal\nUniversity, China, together with colleagues from the University of\nOxford and elsewhere analyzed the spread of dengue viruses in Asia\nfrom 1956 to 2015. They used 2202 genetic sequences of dengue viruses,\ncollected in 20 countries or regions of Asia over the 59 years, to\ndetermine how different strains were related. They also investigated\ntrends in air travel, maritime mobility, migration, and\nsocio-economics to determine what factors impact the spread of\ndengue. The spread of 3 different dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1, -2, and -3,\nis associated with air traffic more so than any other factors, the\ndata revealed. Air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India, the\nresearchers found, help seed dengue epidemics, while China, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, and Singapore help diffuse the virus to other Asian\ncountries. \"Future trends in global mobility could potentially accelerate the\nappearance and diffusion of DENV worldwide,\" the researchers say.\n\"Prevention and control of dengue epidemics requires a better\nunderstanding of its mode of geographic dissemination, especially for\ncountries in the tropics.\" Reference: Tian H, Sun Z, Faria NR, et al.

The agency reported\nactions against 2 large stem cell clinics and a biotech company,\nsaying that it was critical to shut down \"unscrupulous actors\" in\nregenerative medicine, a broad umbrella that includes stem cell and\ngene therapies and immunotherapies. \"The FDA will not allow deceitful\nactors to take advantage of vulnerable patients by purporting to have\ntreatments or cures for serious diseases without any proof that they\nactually work,\" said Dr Scott Gottlieb, the FDA commissioner. Stem cells, which can be extracted from bone marrow, blood, or fat,\ncan develop into many different types of cells, and are thought to\nhave the potential to repair or replace tissue damaged by disease,\ninjury, or aging. But so far, the FDA has approved only a few\nstem-cell products. The companies that the FDA cited have been performing liposuction to\nremove belly fat from patients, extracting stem cells and then\ninjecting those cells back into the patients to treat various\nailments. On Fri 25 Aug 2017, the agency said, federal marshals seized 500\ndoses of live vaccinia virus vaccine for smallpox belonging to\nStemImmune Inc., a San Diego firm that develops stem cell-based\nimmunotherapies for cancer. The raid came after the FDA learned that\nthe vaccine was being used to create an unapproved stem cell product,\na combination of excess amounts of vaccine and stem cells derived from\nbody fat, which was then administered to cancer patients with\npotentially compromised immune systems. The FDA said patients at the\nCalifornia Stem Cell Treatment Centers in Rancho Mirage and Beverly\nHills, California, received the treatment made with the smallpox\nvaccine. It also said it had serious concerns about how StemImmune\nobtained the vaccine for use in an unapproved and potentially\ndangerous treatment. StemImmune obtained at least some of the vaccine from the CDC,\naccording to Thomas Skinner, a CDC spokesman. In its request, the\ncompany said it was conducting cancer research involving the vaccinia\nvirus, and needed to vaccinate researchers  a seemingly legitimate\nreason. The company did not tell the CDC that it was going to inject\nthe vaccine into patients, he said. A statement from StemImmune said\nthe company had lawfully obtained the drug. The FDA also issued a warning letter to US Stem Cell, a private clinic\nin Sunrise, Florida. The company was the subject of a March 2017\nreport in The New England Journal of Medicine, describing how one\nwoman went blind and 2 others suffered severe, permanent eye damage\nafter being given shots of stem cells, extracted from fat, into their\neyes. The warning letter accused the company of impairing the FDA's\nability to conduct its inspection by refusing to allow inspectors in,\nand denying them access to employees. It also said that US Stem Cell\nhad failed to establish proper quality control and sanitary\nstandards.

The current vaccine\n\"ACAM2000\" is the same virus as the former \"Dryvax\" except that the\nvirus is grown in tissue culture rather than from inoculation of\ncalves. The only approved indication for the vaccine is to protect\nindividuals who are working with variations of the vaccinia vaccine in\nlaboratories and for military personnel or others who theoretically\ncould be exposed to smallpox as a biowarfare event. I recently immunized several dozen laboratory workers with ACAM2000\nrelated to work they will be doing with a recombinant vaccinia virus\nin an animal model. In order to obtain the vaccine, we had to fill out\na request form with a list of individuals to be immunized. As a\nreminder, the technique for immunization is \"scarification\" where a\nsmall amount of the reconstituted virus is introduced into the skin\nusing a bifurcated needle\n((https://jetinfectors.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/bifurcated-needle-1.jpg?w=401&h=261)).\nThe primary \"take\" is a vesicle/pustule developing about 7 days later\n(shown at\n(http://health.mo.gov/emergencies/ert/pdf/SmallpoxVaccinationReactions.pdf)).\nOne contraindication for use is in immunocompromised hosts (including\nsome patients with cancer) and the virus is never inoculated by other\ntechniques. More information about vaccination can be obtained from\nthe CDC at (https://www.cdc.gov/smallpox/vaccine-basics/index.html). Currently in press in Lancet Infectious Diseases, Clarissa Damaso from\nInstituto de Biofísica Carlos Chagas Filho, Universidade Federal do\nRio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil has written an excellent review\non the history of smallpox vaccines: Damaso CR: Revisiting Jenner's mysteries, the role of the Beaugency\nlymph in the evolutionary path of ancient smallpox vaccines. Lancet\nInfect Dis. 2017. pii: S1473-3099(17)30445-0. doi:\n10.1016/S1473-3099(17)30445-0; full text, references, and figures\navailable at\n(http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/laninf/PIIS1473-3099(17)30445-0.pdf): \"The origins of Jenner's vaccine have been intensively debated over\nthe years. British researcher Downie studied the close immunological\nrelationship of variola, cowpox, and vaccinia viruses, which led him\nto propose in 1951 that vaccinia virus had emerged from cowpox virus\nin the early years of vaccination (26). In 1965, Downie strongly\nopposed Peter Razzell's proposal that vaccinia virus had derived from\nan attenuated form of variola virus (27-29). Derrick Baxby (1940-2017)\nalso refuted Razzell's belief and proposed in 1981 that modern 20th\ncentury vaccines had derived from horsepox virus (30-32). In fact, we\ncurrently know that vaccinia virus is more closely related to horsepox\nvirus than to cowpox virus. On the basis of full-genome analysis and\nrecent phylogenetic inferences, horsepox virus is considered an\nancestor of the vaccinia lineage (33-36). Because all modern smallpox\nvaccine strains consist of vaccinia virus, one would expect that\nhorsepox virus, or even vaccinia virus, would be better candidates\nthan cowpox virus for the original source of Jenner's vaccine.\nAlthough an attractive hypothesis, the obscure history of cowpox,\nhorsepox, and vaccinia viruses further adds to the mystery. Since the\nmid-20th century, cows have been rarely found sick because of\ninfection by cowpox virus, and only felines, pet rodents, and zoo\nanimals, primarily in Europe, have been affected by the virus in the\npast decades (37-40). As for horsepox, the disease is rare and some\nbelieve it is extinct, at least in Europe (23,24,31,32,41). Only one\nexisting strain of horsepox virus obtained from Mongolian horses in\n1976 is currently known (33). However, vaccinia virus has never been\nfound naturally occurring in animals, except in India, where the\nstrain buffalopox infects buffaloes, and in Brazil, where the strain\nCantagalo (Cantagalo virus) infects dairy cows (2,42-44). In any case,\nall 3 orthopoxviruses cause zoonotic infections, and individuals\nacquire the infection when handling infected animals figures 2 and 3\n(2,22,37,40,45,46)\" \"The history and evolutionary relationships of the different smallpox\nvaccine strains remain obscure, because most strains and clonal\nvariants have not yet been completely sequenced. Historical and\nscientific evidence suggests that the Beaugency lymph lymph passed in\ncows by Chambon and Lanoix and, in October, 1866, they mixed this\nmaterial with lymph obtained from a 2nd natural case of cowpox\ndiscovered in Saint-Mandé, in the suburbs of Paris. The mixture was\nreferred to as the Beaugency lymph and was used subsequently by the\nAnimal Vaccine Institute as a seed to produce the vaccine\n(20,48,72,74) and horsepox virus made a strong contribution to the\ngenetic makeup of the existing vaccine strains, particularly those\nfrom continental Europe, USA, and Brazil. Evidence also suggests that\nthe Beaugency lymph was probably a vaccinia virus strain or a close\nancestor related to horsepox virus, and not a cowpox strain. Thus, it\nis reasonable to believe not only that cowpox virus was not used as a\nsmallpox vaccine in the 19th century, but that it might have never\nbeen used at all. Assumptions about the origins of the Beaugency lymph\nalso indicate that vaccinia virus was once a circulating virus in\nanimals in Europe in the 19th century, but later it disappeared and\nnow has no natural hosts, except in Brazil, India, and perhaps in\nEgypt, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal. Many questions still persist,\nand analysis of full-genome sequences of ancient vaccine strains would\nhelp unravel this fascinating medical mystery.\" - Mod.LL A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at:\n(http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106).

Source: Hindustan Times (edited) (http://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-health-department-seeks-help-from-icmr-cdc/story-mJCzA29yvfxDX1TtjnInIK.html)   Under attack for Japanese encephalitis deaths at Gorakhpur's BRD Medical College, Uttar Pradesh health and family welfare department has sought assistance from various agencies to identify the pathogen infecting children in the region.  The health department will take help from experts at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and US-based agency Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to check the spread of Japanese encephalitis in Gorakhpur region.  In April 2017, the department had launched an intensive vaccination drive in 20 districts prone to Japanese encephalitis (JE) and acute encephalitis syndrome (AES).  About 93 lakh 9 300 000 children were vaccinated before the onset of monsoon. Though the number of JE patients came down, AES cases continued to grow. See Japanese encephalitis & other - India (18): comment http://promedmail.org/post/20170830.5283261 where the decline in JE and the increase of AES is described and graphed. - Mod.TY  Talking to HT, secretary (health and family welfare) V Hekali Zhimomi said, \"The clinical and laboratory test of the samples of patients' serum attributed 50 percent of AES cases to scrub typhus, Coxsackie virus, enterovirus (polio entrovirus, echo virus), malaria, herpes, meningoencephalitis, tuberculous encephalitis while the remaining 50 percent of the pathogens remained unknown.\"  The initial study attributed scrub typhus to mites and unhygienic conditions.  A team of experts from ICMR visited BRD Medical College and government hospitals after the death of the 30 children on 10 - 11 Aug 2017 to take stock of ground reality.  Later, the team led by ICMR director-general Soumya Swaminathan met chief minister Yogi Adityanath to discuss the measures required to strengthen health facilities.  During the meeting, the health department officers drew the attention of ICMR scientists towards unidentified pathogens that were infecting children in Gorakhpur and adjoining districts.  \"The ICMR officers assured assistance and recommended better health services in rural areas and mobilising human resource at government hospitals,\" Zhimomi said.  She said since quacks and healers active in rural areas were the 1st contact person for patients, the health department was planning to involve them in fighting the menace.  Quacks, popular as 'jhola chhap doctor' in east UP, will be given training to guide suspected AES patients.  Auxiliary nursing midwives (ANM), accredited social health activists (ASHA) and anganbari workers in villages are being trained to create awareness among the people aganbaris are a type of rural mother and child care center in India.  The department has also decided to deploy health education officers in awareness programme.  The focus will be on early admission of patients at nearby primary health centres (PHCs) and community health centres (CHCs). The officers will also create awareness among villagers through information-education-communication (IEC) regarding preventive measures, symptom of the disease and early examination by medical practitioners.  \"The department has identified 676 high-risk villages in Gorakhpur region where maximum cases of JE/AES have been reported. The district magistrates have been directed to launch sanitation drive in villages, organise awareness campaigns and carry out fogging to eliminate mosquitoes and mites which are the carriers of the virus Japanese encephalitis is a mosquito-transmitted virus, scrub typhus is a mite-transmitted rickettsial bacterium. - Mod.TY,\" she said.  Services of Christian Medical College (CMC) Vellore and PATH Foundation will be taken to train government doctors managing critical care units at the hospital.  The health department is also working to build confidence of government doctors at PHCs and CHCs.  It was found during the study that instead of handling patients, the doctors at health centres referred them to BRD Medical College. The aim is to reduce the burden of medical college which receives huge number of patients from Bihar and Nepal as well. The state government is improving facilities at district hospitals and CHCs.  \"The doctors have been asked to admit JE/AES patients to the hospital rather than referring them to medical college,\" she said.  Talking to HT, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said the state government had decided to seek the assistance of private doctors and members of the Indian Medical Association to check AES.  The unit of National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, located in Gorakhpur, will be strengthened to conduct research work.  Byline: Rajesh Kumar Singh   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  The determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_), and lychee fruit consumption. Recently, scrub typhus has been implicated in many AES cases. With the likelihood of multiple etiologies, a long-term and well integrated study will be required to determine the causes of AES. The plans mentioned above will expand and intensify surveillance. Laboratory support will be increased and a broad range or expertise will be added. The patient load in the BRD medical college will be reduced and the capability of district hospital and community health centers for patient treatment will be improved. One hopes that these integrated efforts will last long enough to provide an accurate diagnosis of what is causing AES and lead to some initiatives to better treat or to prevent cases.

On Sun 3 Sep 2017, some 59 officers were hospitalised in various\nhospitals in Nairobi with another 36 admitted Mon 4 Sep 2017, after\ncontracting the disease. They were part of a group of 430 officers\ndeployed to Nairobi ahead of the Supreme Court ruling on presidential\npoll petition on Fri 1 Sep 2017. They were residing at the\nMultimedia University Hotel in Rongai, about 17 kilometers 10.6 mi\nsouth of the capital. \"Those infected did not get the disease from the Multimedia University\nsince they had their lunch away from the institution. Investigations\nshow that the source is the Nairobi Area Police Canteen,\" said Dr\nRalph Muli, the Nairobi County head of Diseases Surveillance.\nConsequently, the City has temporarily closed the canteen. The Health Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu said the officers were in\nstable condition. Dr Mailu said investigations were underway to\nestablish whether the canteen had outsourced services to cater for the\nlarge number of officers. He said the ministry was concerned that\ninstead of eliminating cholera, new cases were emerging. Nairobi was first hit by the outbreak on 19 May 2017, with 56 cases\nhaving been reported. One of the police officers who requested anonymity said they ate ugali\n(a Kenyan staple made of maize flour) and meat stew at the canteen on\nSat 2 Sep 2017.

Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:\n- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit.

This came about after 2\nkidney recipients in Taiwan were diagnosed with dengue 2 days after\nreceiving a kidney each from the same donor, said National Cheng Kung\nUniversity microbiology and immunology professor Dr Oscar Perng\nGuey-chuen. \"This indicates a potential risk,\" the Taiwan-based\nscientist said, adding that no dengue virus was detected in the\ndonor's blood. He said the donor contracted dengue in 2015 and in mid-2016, he died\nin an accident. His family donated his corneas, liver, heart, and\nkidneys. Both patients had the same strain of the dengue virus the\ndonor had in 2015 and one of the recipients died of dengue\nhaemorrhagic fever, he said. Asked where the virus could be hiding since it could not be detected\nin the blood, he said it was a question scientists are trying to\nanswer. Interestingly, those who received the donor's corneas, liver,\nand heart did not develop dengue, Dr Perng said on the sidelines of\nthe National Dengue And Arboviruses Infection Conference 2017\nyesterday 12 Aug 2017. He said although there was not enough\nevidence to show the virus came from the donor as the kidneys were not\ntested for dengue before the transplant, the same virus was found in\nthe patients' bodies after that. Dr Perng said his team had studied mice for dengue virus in the blood\ntestes, kidney, liver, spleen and brain, and found the virus present\nin the kidneys and brain. \"We believe the virus probably resided in\nthe kidneys and was not cleared by the body,\" he said, adding that the\nvirus could have been activated after transplant. He said this raised\nconcerns about asymptomatic people who are dengue carriers. Health Ministry deputy director, general Datuk Dr S Jeyaindran said\npatients with severe dengue would have better recovery if they were\ngiven colloids, a more concentrated fluid, at the early stage in fluid\nmanagement for dengue patients. Dr Jeyaindran, who was representing\nHealth Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam, said colloids may be\nintroduced at an earlier stage, instead of saline because it has not\nbeen successful in treating patients with severe dengue. He said more\nstudies will be conducted to find out at which stage the colloids\nshould be given. byline: Loh Foon Fong \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) - Air travel related spread of dengue.\nDate: Thu 3 Aug 2017.\nSource: Medical Xpress (edited)\n(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-08-air-responsible-dengue-asia.html) \nWhile the incidences of many other infectious diseases have declined\nover the past decade, the number of cases and outbreaks of dengue\nvirus have continued to increase. The spread of dengue to new areas is\nlikely due in large part to trends in air travel, researchers now\nreport in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Dengue virus affects as estimated 390 million people around the globe\neach year, and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild fever and\nheadache to severe low blood pressure. The virus has mostly caused\ndisease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, but a 2014\noutbreak in Japan broke that pattern. Overall, the geographic area\naffected by dengue has been growing in recent years. In the new work, Huaiyu Tian and Bing Xu, both of Beijing Normal\nUniversity, China, together with colleagues from the University of\nOxford and elsewhere analyzed the spread of dengue viruses in Asia\nfrom 1956 to 2015. They used 2202 genetic sequences of dengue viruses,\ncollected in 20 countries or regions of Asia over the 59 years, to\ndetermine how different strains were related. They also investigated\ntrends in air travel, maritime mobility, migration, and\nsocio-economics to determine what factors impact the spread of\ndengue. The spread of 3 different dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1, -2, and -3,\nis associated with air traffic more so than any other factors, the\ndata revealed. Air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India, the\nresearchers found, help seed dengue epidemics, while China, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, and Singapore help diffuse the virus to other Asian\ncountries. \"Future trends in global mobility could potentially accelerate the\nappearance and diffusion of DENV worldwide,\" the researchers say.\n\"Prevention and control of dengue epidemics requires a better\nunderstanding of its mode of geographic dissemination, especially for\ncountries in the tropics.\" Reference: Tian H, Sun Z, Faria NR, et al.

Date: Thu 31 Aug 2017. From: Michael J. Bangs (mbangs@fmi.com) (edited)   It stands to reason that the presence of _Anopheles farauti_ as the new entrant into New Caledonia is presumably recent. The nearest neighbor is Vanuatu, a malaria-endemic country that has but one anopheline species present in that island group, _Anopheles farauti_ sensu stricto, an effective malaria vector provided you add _Plasmodium_ to the mix.  _Anopheles farauti_ is one member of 8 known sibling species in the _Farauti_ Complex (closely related species that are morphologically identical, thus confounding accurate identification without the use of molecular techniques). It is by far the most widely distributed species in the complex in the southwest Pacific region (Maluku island group, eastern Indonesia to northern Australia, PNG, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu). The species' ability to inhabit brackish water environments (predominantly a coastal inhabitant) has aided in its dispersal throughout the region.  The origin of the anopheline population in New Caledonia might remain a mystery, but this discovery is of concern. If the area of establishment is relatively confined, it might be possible to eliminate this species before it extends further into the country. Foremost, identify the species.   Michael J. Bangs, MSPH, PhD. Public Health & Malaria Control International SOS Kuala Kencana, Papua, Indonesia (mbangs@fmi.com)  ProMED thanks Dr. Bangs for his comments.

Source: Pajhwok Afghan News (edited) (https://www.pajhwok.com/en/2017/08/28/congo-virus-kills-13-infects-42-herat)   Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has killed 13 people in western Herat province this year 2017, with another 42 being treated for the deadly virus, according to officials.  CCHF is a viral disease. Symptoms may include fever, muscle pains, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding into the skin. The CCHF virus is typically spread by tick bites or contact with livestock carrying the disease.  Health officials in Herat advised people to be careful these days due to increased interaction with livestock in the wake of Eidul Adha Sacrifice Feast; 31 Aug-4 Sep 2017, when Muslims across the globe slaughter millions of animals.  Public health director in Herat Abdul Hakim Tamana said many people lost their lives to the Congo virus in the province this year 2017. He said 55 Congo cases were registered in the civil hospital since late March and of the patients, 13 had died. The deceased included 7 men and 6 women, he added.  Tamana said the virus spread from animals and people slaughtering animals should wear gloves.  A livestock farmer, who has contracted Congo virus, said: \"When I slaughtered the sheep, its blood covered my hands and later I started falling sick.\"  Ahmad Khalil Waez, animal healthcare director, said citizens should be careful while slaughtering animals to avoid contracting the Congo virus. He said a butcher should used special glasses, coat, gloves, mask, and shoes while slaughtering the animal.  People mainly contract the CCHF virus from infected ticks or contact with infected animal blood and tissue.  There are no vaccines available to immunize animals but precautionary measures include disinfection of livestock pens, submerging livestock in solutions for decontamination, and meat packaging safeguards.  The virus has had a presence in neighbouring Iran where the virus killed 3 people in 2015.  According to the World Health Organization, CCHF's mortality rate is about 30 percent and is endemic to Africa, the Balkans and Ukraine, the Middle East, and Central Asia.  CCHF was first detected in the Crimea in 1944 and then in the Congo in 1969. In 2011, it was detected for the first time in ticks in Spain.  Byline: Storai Karimi   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  In 2008, a major outbreak was reported in Herat City, western Afghanistan, with approximately 60 suspected and 6 confirmed cases. Later, a cross-sectional seroprevalence survey was conducted among livestock-owning households in the same districts of Herat City where the outbreak had occurred, which showed that IgG seroprevalence was 11.2 and 75.0 percent in humans (n = 330) and livestock (n = 132), respectively ((https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3310665/)).  In 2016, 66 cases had been reported by 7 Sep, with 12 deaths ((http://www.emro.who.int/afg/afghanistan-news/cchf-eid.html)). CCHF virus has been observed in over 30 countries, including in Africa (Democratic Republic of Congo, South Africa, Nigeria, Senegal, Uganda, Tanzania, Mauritania, Kenya), Asia (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, China), the Middle East (Iran, Iraq, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman), and southeastern Europe (the Russian Federation, Bulgaria, Albania, Kosovo, Turkey, Greece, and Spain) ((https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23458713)).  People most at risk of contracting CCHF include animal herders, livestock workers, butchers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Healthcare workers are also at risk of infection through unprotected contact with infectious blood and body fluids while caring for patients.

The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare is advising tourists to go to hospital if they develop a high fever or generalized rash after returning to Japan.  Although the World Health Organization verified that Japan has eliminated infections of endemic measles strains in 2015, group infections originating from people who contracted the disease abroad are spreading in the country. As of 6 Aug 2017, the number of patients reached 169 this year in Japan, already eclipsing the figure in the previous year.  About 4100 patients in Italy and around 6500 patients in Romania have already been confirmed as of August 2017 compared with about 860 and 2000, respectively, throughout 2016, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.  Symptoms of the highly contagious disease include runny nose, red and watery eyes, high fever, and rash. The virus is spread through coughing and sneezing and can cause complications such as pneumonia and can even result in death in one in 1000 patients, according to the ministry. The ministry recommends people traveling overseas to check their vaccination records and take an additional shot if they have only been vaccinated once.  The disease was prevalent about a decade ago in Japan with the number of patients soaring to over 10 000 in 2008 but the country was later considered as free from infections of the virus.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Japan can be found at (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/156). - Mod.LK   <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Australia (Perth, Western Australia): ex Italy.

Large measles outbreak introduced by asylum seekers and spread among the insufficiently vaccinated resident population, Berlin, October 2014 to August 2015. Euro Surveill. 2017; 22(34): pii=30599 - Abstract  The largest measles outbreak in Berlin since 2001 occurred from October 2014 to August 2015. Overall, 1344 cases were ascertained, 86 per cent (with available information) unvaccinated, including 146 (12 per cent) asylum seekers. Median age was 17 years (interquartile range: 4-29 years), 26 per cent were hospitalised and a 1 year old child died. Measles virus genotyping uniformly revealed the variant 'D8-Rostov-Don' and descendants. The virus was likely introduced by and initially spread among asylum seekers before affecting Berlin's resident population. Among Berlin residents, the highest incidence was in children younger than 2 years, yet most cases (52 per cent) were adults. Post-exposure vaccinations in homes for asylum seekers, not always conducted, occurred later (median: 7.5 days) than the recommended 72 hours after onset of the 1st case and reached only half of potential contacts. Asylum seekers should not only have non-discriminatory, equitable access to vaccination, they also need to be offered measles vaccination in a timely fashion, that is, immediately upon arrival in the receiving country. Supplementary immunisation activities targeting the resident population, particularly adults, are urgently needed in Berlin.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail.

Source: Romania Insider (edited) (https://www.romania-insider.com/measles-kills-iraqi-refugee/)   The ongoing measles outbreak keeps making victims in Romania. A 10 month old girl, who was a refugee from Iraq, became the 33rd person to die of the infection, reports local Digi24. The girl arrived in Romania on 7 Jul 2017 with her family, and the doctors diagnosed her with measles in August. They also discovered that the child was suffering from malnutrition and severe psychomotor retardation.  The measles outbreak is still a major problem in Romania, with more than 8900 cases reported across the country until 25 Aug 2017, including 33 deaths, according to data from the National Center for Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases (CNSCBT). Most deaths were registered in Timis (9), Dolj (7), and Arad (6) counties.  Measles is a highly contagious respiratory infection caused by a virus. It causes a total-body skin rash and flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough, and runny nose. According to information posted on WHO's website, the virus is highly contagious, spreading by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact, and direct contact with infected nasal or throat secretions. Unvaccinated young children pose the highest risk of measles and its complications, including death.  The Romanian Government adopted earlier this month August 2017 a draft bill on the organization and financing of population vaccination (https://www.romania-insider.com/romania-draft-bill-vaccination/). The project was sent to the Parliament for approval and could come into force in January 2018.  byline: Irina Marica   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Measles tends to be more severe in children who are malnourished, especially children who are also vitamin A deficient. And complications are commoner and more serious in malnourished children. Because of complications such as diarrhoea, measles may lead to failure to thrive. Infection with measles virus may lead to kwashiorkor or marasmus in children who are underweight at the time that they get infected. Therefore, measles may result in, or aggravate, malnutrition.

Source: News-Medical/Life Sciences (edited) (https://www.news-medical.net/news/20170826/New-study-highlights-role-played-by-demographics-in-the-spread-of-measles.aspx)   Even if the incidence of measles infection has decreased by at least 90 per cent worldwide since the introduction of the vaccine, measles is still one of the major causes of death in children among vaccine-preventable diseases. Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world.  A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries.  Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years.  \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\"  \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea\".  The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years 2 million DALYs since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln 13 million DALYs in the US, and 36-mln 36 million DALYs in Ethiopia.  \"Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,\" continues Prof Melegaro \"our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population. Tailoring immunization campaigns to achieve measles eradication goals is essential and currently, for some countries, this means considering also the role of unprotected adolescents and young adults.\"   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Reference - Trentini F, Poletti P, Merler S, Melegaro A.

There is also a seronegative window period that precedes the first detection of HBV DNA and prior to the appearance of HBsAg following acute infection. However, the level of virus may not be sufficient to cause HBV based on the HBV genotype (Hsia et al, 2006).  2. Is minipool NAT or ID NAT being done for HBV DNA detection by blood banks in Ireland? And if minipool NAT, how many samples were in the minipool since this could compromise sensitivity?  3. Was the archived donor specimen also tested for total anti-HBc, a test done in US blood facilities, but not in Ireland?  4. What is the evidence that the recipient was not previously infected with HBV, while bearing in mind that patients with chronic hepatitis B may be positive for IgM anti-HBc during acute reactivation of their disease. And if the recipient was IgM positive, what was the ratio of the anti-HBc test result based on the cutoff value and the patient's value?  5. Fortunately, the outcome is usually favorable with limited risk of chronicity in immunocompetent patients who acquire acute hepatitis B.   F. Blaine Hollinger, M.D. Professor of Medicine, Molecular Virology & Epidemiology Director, Eugene B. Casey Hepatitis Research Center Baylor College of Medicine Houston, TX (blaineh@bcm.edu)  It is always an honor to receive comments from Dr. Hollinger, a long time leader in viral hepatitis research.  Regarding his questions/comments:  1. As I noted in the moderation of the original post, there is a lesser discussed \"window period\" occurring in the incubation period of acute hepatitis B prior to the development of HBsAg and before the development of anti-HBc (IgM and then IgG). The more classical \"window period\" occurs towards the end of acute hepatitis B, whether clinically overt or not, when HBsAg is not longer detectable by standard assays but before anti-HBs is detectable. The only serologic evidence of HBV is anti-HBc and IgM anti-HBc should be positive. HBV DNA is also detectable. It has been shown that blood transfused during this period can be infectious for HBV.  2-4. All good questions which I cannot supply answers to.  5. Most patients who are not immunosuppressed will clear HBV within 3-6 months. 10 percent will not although half of these are usually clear within a year. No information regarding the patient in this case was supplied. - Mod.LL  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/39).

From: Niamh O'Flaherty (Niamh.O'Flaherty@ibts.ie)   IBTS response to ProMED: Hepatitis B - Ireland - Thank you for giving the opportunity for The Irish Blood Transfusion Service (IBTS) to respond to your recent article and subsequent comments related to the first known case of HBV transmission through blood transfusion in Ireland.  The IBTS employ individual donation nucleic acid testing (ID- NAT) to screen every blood donation for blood-borne viruses (BBV) including HBV, using the Ultrio-Elite (UE) multiplex assay manufactured by Grifols/Hologic. Both the manufacturer and the IBTS have confirmed the assay has a limit of detection for HBV of the order of 4 IU/mL. In addition, in terms of screening for HBV markers we test for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen.  For clarification purposes, the transmission of HBV in this case was due to a donation obtained in the pre-ID NAT window period, when the level of HBV DNA in the donor's blood was below the limit of detection of even this extremely sensitive assay. The window period for the UE assay is of the order of just 15 days. The IBTS introduced ID NAT testing in 2009, in order to avail of this shorter window period and hence earliest possible detection of HBV infection. As mentioned in your comments, the serological window period is significantly longer.  A full investigation has been conducted into this case. During this investigation it was demonstrated that the assay performed within the expected level of sensitivity. In addition, the investigation demonstrated that all aspects of laboratory testing and donor screening were satisfactory. The IBTS will continue to employ the most advanced technologies and safest screening strategy available to maintain the safety of the blood supplied to the people of Ireland.   Dr. Niamh O'Flaherty Consultant Microbiologist Irish Blood Transfusion Service (Niamh.O'Flaherty@ibts.ie)  ProMED thanks Dr. O'Flaherty for the quick response. It seems that the \"serological window period\" when HBsAg disappears and anti-HBs has not appeared yet is not the issue here but rather the blood was transfused prior to the HBsAg becoming positive and anti-HBc has yet to be positive. Anti-HBc would be positive in the \"serological window\".  Although the Irish press has been somewhat reactive regarding this quite rare episode, clearly the Irish Blood Transfusion Service is not at fault at all here. - Mod.LL  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/39).

This is the 1st detection of KHVD in BC by the CFIA, but the disease has been previously detected in Manitoba and Ontario.  The disease detection was associated with an import of koi from Israel by a wholesaler who distributed fish to greenhouses, pet stores and garden centres within BC for sale to private individuals. As a result of this detection, the import of all susceptible species of aquatic animals from Israel for the following end uses will be suspended until further notice:  - aquarium - commercial; - aquarium - private; - outdoor holding unit - commercial; and - outdoor holding unit - private.  The CFIA is committed to working with Israel to ensure that Canada's aquatic animal health import requirements are met and the suspended zoosanitary export certificate, which applies to all exports from Israel for the aforementioned end uses, can be renegotiated as quickly as possible in order to minimize any impact on trade.  KHVD poses no risk to human health or food safety; however, this virus can infect other susceptible species and is reportable under Canada's Reportable Diseases Regulations.

Public Health Gibraltar and the Environmental\nAgency confirmed that the mosquito of the species _Aedes albopictus_,\nalso known as the tiger mosquito, has been found in Gibraltar. Last June 2017 after 9 months of intensive surveillance, officials\nsaid no tiger mosquito had been found in Gibraltar. But this has now\nchanged after the 1st tiger mosquito was found in the urban domestic\nenvironment within Gibraltar. \"This finding alone does not however\nmaterially alter any health risks in Gibraltar and there is no\nimmediate cause for public concern,\" the government said in a\nstatement. Public Health Gibraltar was first alerted in January 2016 to the\ndiscovery of the mosquito in Málaga and Algeciras in Andalusia,\nSpain. Since then, together with the Environmental Agency, it began\nworking with international experts to mount surveillance in Gibraltar.\nWorld Health Organization experts visited Gibraltar and gave advice on\nsetting traps and monitoring locations, but no tiger mosquito had been\ndetected until now. The tiger mosquito is not native to Gibraltar and has not been\npreviously found here. It is common in other countries where it\ntransmits viral diseases like Zika, dengue, and chikungunya. It is a\ndomestic species, breeds in water in urban areas  water butts,\nblocked drains, rainwater gullies  and is able to reach high\nabundance around residential areas. It is also a day-time mosquito,\nthat aggressively bites humans. \"Health risks to the public only arise if the virus causing these\ndiseases is also present, which is not the case in Gibraltar,\" the\ngovernment said. \"The virus can, however, be imported by travellers\nreturning from an overseas country and if this happens, there is a\nrisk of spread, but only if the mosquito bites within a small window\nperiod of about a week after the fever starts.\" Public Health Gibraltar has been raising awareness of travel risk\namongst travellers through its publication A Factsheet for Travellers\nand recommends the following precautions:\n- before travelling to affected areas, consult your doctor or seek\nadvice from a travel clinic, especially if you have an immune disorder\nor severe chronic illness;\n- if you are pregnant or are considering pregnancy, consider\npostponing non-essential travel;\n- when staying in a mosquito-prone area, wear mosquito repellents and\ntake mosquito bite prevention measures;\n- if you have symptoms within 3 weeks of return from an affected\ncountry, contact your doctor;\n- if you have been diagnosed with any of the diseases Zika, dengue, or\nchikungunya, take strict mosquito bite prevention measures for 10 days\nafter the fever starts. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) The appearance of _Aedes albopictus_ in Gibraltar is not surprising.\nA map of the distribution of this species as of April this year (2017)\nshows it present around the Mediterranean Basin and up to Gibraltar on\nthe west\n((https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/aedes-albopictus-current-known-distribution-europe-april-2017)).\nNow it has been found in Gibraltar. The concerns are real about\ntransmission of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses should\npopulations of _Ae. albopictus_ become established. In 2015 there were\na few locally acquired cases of dengue in the south of France. This\nalso happened on a larger scale in Emilia Romagna, Italy, when a\nviremic man introduced chikungunya virus into Italy and sparked an\noutbreak. One hopes that mosquito surveillance will continue in\nGibraltar, perhaps be intensified, and help guide vector control\nefforts. - Mod.TY A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at:\n(http://healthmap.org/promed/p/517).

Among Berlin residents, the highest incidence was in children younger than 2 years, yet most cases (52 per cent) were adults. Post-exposure vaccinations in homes for asylum seekers, not always conducted, occurred later (median: 7.5 days) than the recommended 72 hours after onset of the 1st case and reached only half of potential contacts. Asylum seekers should not only have non-discriminatory, equitable access to vaccination, they also need to be offered measles vaccination in a timely fashion, that is, immediately upon arrival in the receiving country. Supplementary immunisation activities targeting the resident population, particularly adults, are urgently needed in Berlin.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail.

Source: Romania Insider (edited) (https://www.romania-insider.com/measles-kills-iraqi-refugee/)   The ongoing measles outbreak keeps making victims in Romania. A 10 month old girl, who was a refugee from Iraq, became the 33rd person to die of the infection, reports local Digi24. The girl arrived in Romania on 7 Jul 2017 with her family, and the doctors diagnosed her with measles in August. They also discovered that the child was suffering from malnutrition and severe psychomotor retardation.  The measles outbreak is still a major problem in Romania, with more than 8900 cases reported across the country until 25 Aug 2017, including 33 deaths, according to data from the National Center for Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases (CNSCBT). Most deaths were registered in Timis (9), Dolj (7), and Arad (6) counties.  Measles is a highly contagious respiratory infection caused by a virus. It causes a total-body skin rash and flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough, and runny nose. According to information posted on WHO's website, the virus is highly contagious, spreading by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact, and direct contact with infected nasal or throat secretions. Unvaccinated young children pose the highest risk of measles and its complications, including death.  The Romanian Government adopted earlier this month August 2017 a draft bill on the organization and financing of population vaccination (https://www.romania-insider.com/romania-draft-bill-vaccination/). The project was sent to the Parliament for approval and could come into force in January 2018.  byline: Irina Marica   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Measles tends to be more severe in children who are malnourished, especially children who are also vitamin A deficient. And complications are commoner and more serious in malnourished children. Because of complications such as diarrhoea, measles may lead to failure to thrive. Infection with measles virus may lead to kwashiorkor or marasmus in children who are underweight at the time that they get infected. Therefore, measles may result in, or aggravate, malnutrition.

Date: Sat 26 Aug 2017. Source: News-Medical/Life Sciences (edited) (https://www.news-medical.net/news/20170826/New-study-highlights-role-played-by-demographics-in-the-spread-of-measles.aspx)   Even if the incidence of measles infection has decreased by at least 90 per cent worldwide since the introduction of the vaccine, measles is still one of the major causes of death in children among vaccine-preventable diseases. Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world.  A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries.  Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years.  \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\"  \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea\".  The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years 2 million DALYs since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln 13 million DALYs in the US, and 36-mln 36 million DALYs in Ethiopia.  \"Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,\" continues Prof Melegaro \"our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population. Tailoring immunization campaigns to achieve measles eradication goals is essential and currently, for some countries, this means considering also the role of unprotected adolescents and young adults.\"   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Reference - Trentini F, Poletti P, Merler S, Melegaro A.

From: Antonio Battisti (antonio.battisti@izslt.it) (edited)   The diagnosis of Anthrax was done at Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale del Lazio e della Toscana (IZSLT), in Rome, Italy (same province of the outbreak) after an onsite inspection by vets from IZSLT who were called by the Local Veterinary Services, on Fri 25 Aug 2017.  During the inspection, IZSLT decided that Anthrax was the main etiology to be firstly investigated. Four bovine animals found dead at inspection site (a pasture in the municipality of Grottaferrata, province of Rome, Italy), most probably dead in the latter 4-5 hours, were sampled (blood samples, following the international consensus procedures). The Veterinary Services disposed of fallen stock (destruction) according to EU legislation (the 4 animals plus another one that was found dead nearby by the Veterinary Services).  All 4 cases investigated were preliminarly diagnosed as Anthrax cases on the same day, by microscopic examination of blood smears stained with polychrome methylene blue (McFedyan's reaction), and confirmed by cultures and PCR (chromosomal target, pXO1 and pXO2 plasmidic targets) by the next Mon 28 Aug 2017. These are the only cases that were confirmed as Anthrax by a laboratory diagnosis.  The area is an historical Anthrax site and pastures are located in the crater of an extinct volcano, not far from the Albano Lake, itself a lake of volcanic origin. Anthrax cases in livestock living in the area are considered absolutely sporadic nowadays, thanks to the intense vaccine prevention measures of the past decades (from the late 1950s of the 20th century). The outbreak may have been favored by the severe drought ongoing in Central Italy. This is the only outbreak notified in 2017 in the Latium Region. In 2016 one case only was notified in the Rome province, Latium Region (Artena Municipality).

Date: Wed 6 Sep 2017. From: EpiCore Global Surveillance Project (edited)   ProMED circulated a request for further information through the Epi-Core network, and this is a summary of the various responses we received:  Reconstruction of the history 1. Prior to onset of illness, the family was staying at Bibione, Province of Venice (seaside resort) and on 13 Aug 2017, the girl was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus at the Portogruaro hospital (40 km approx 28 mi north of Venice). 2. The family including the girl returned to Trento where they live on 16 Aug 2017 and she was admitted to the hospital for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. She was discharged on 21 Aug 2017. 3. On 16 Aug 2017, 2 children from Burkina Faso with falciparum malaria were admitted to the same children's ward in Trento hospital. 4. Fever was reported in the girl on 28 Aug 2017, the fever then disappeared but returned on 30 Aug 2017 when she was again hospitalized at Trento hospital. Malaria was diagnosed and treatment was started. On 2 Sep 2017 she was air-lifted to the University Hospital in Brescia with a diagnosis of cerebral malaria.   \n<br><br>Communicated by: EpiCore Global Surveillance Project (promed@promedmail.org)  ProMED-mail would like to thank all of the EpiCore members who responded to the request for more information on this event.   The overlap with the 2 cases from Burkina Faso was 5 days and thus infection would have had to have beeen through direct transmission by blood and not through mosquitoes. If the needle used for blood sugar testing in some manner was shared between the known malaria patients and the young girl who had been hospitalized for diabetes, then nosocomial transmission is a possibility.  An alternative possibility is that the infection occurred from local Italian mosquitoes that had been infected by an asymptomatic gametocyte carrier. This is well known to happen and malaria was endemic in northern Italy in the past especially in the period between both world wars when there was a high prevalence of the disease, but it was _P.vivax_ and not _P. falciparum_. Whether the local mosquitoes (_A. maculipennis_ complex) are capable of transmitting _P. falciparum_ malaria is not known, but the possibility is not excluded.  )From infection to the debut of symptoms, the incubation period is usually 7 - 10 days in non-immune individuals. If the hospitalization for the suspected diabetes mellitus in Portogruaro hospital was in fact when she presented with the 1st symptoms of malaria, then she was most likely infected 7 - 10 days previously, however, fever would have been a key presenting symptom.  Thus the key question is when did the 1st symptoms of malaria actually appear  and the only certain point in the information we presently have is that she was febrile on 28 Aug 2017.  There is a huge variability from the time the symptoms started to the time of death in imported (non-immune) malaria cases. A large study of 22 fatal outcomes of patient with _P. falciparum_ malaria returning to Switzerland (Christen et al. Am J Trop Med Hyg 2006;75:1188-94) reported an average of 8 days with a low of 3 days. Thus if the 1st symptoms of malaria were on 28 Aug 2017, the date of actual infection must have taken place within the 10 prior days.  Does the climate allow development of the malaria parasite in the mosquito? The average temperature for Trento in August 2017 is found here: (https://www.accuweather.com/en/it/trento/216357/august-weather/216357). The average night temperature is only reaching 20 C (approx. 68 F) on 18 Aug 2017, otherwise it was well below 20 C (approx. 68 F) with a low of 13 C (approx. 55 F). In order to allow _P.falciparum_ to develop in mosquitoes, the average night temperature must be 20 C (approx. 68 F) or more for 8 - 10 days. Thus the temperature in Trento in August 2017 excludes the possibility the 2 patients from Burkina Faso infected local mosquitoes, which then infected the patient.  The average temperature for Bibione in August 2017 is found here: (https://www.accuweather.com/en/it/bibione/2550920/august-weather/2550920). )From 1 Aug 2017 to 20 Aug 2017 the average night temperature was above 20 C approx. 68 F except for 2 days (12 and 13 Aug 2017) and thus the _P. falciparum_ parasite had the climatic conditions to develop in the mosquito if local mosquitoes are able to transmit _p. falciparum_ and were infected by a gametocyte carrier.  The risk of reintroducing malaria in Italy was discussed in Romi et al. in 2012 (Romi R et al. Probable autochthonous introduced malaria cases in Italy in 2009-2011 and the risk of local vector-borne transmission. Euro Surveill. 2012 Nov 29;17(48). pii: 20325). In Trento (Province of Trentino) the _Anopheles_ species in _A. maculipennis_ complex is present which is regarded as zoophilic (not preferring humans).  In conclusion, it is a possibility that the girl was infected by mosquitoes during her stay in Bibione, but nosocomial infection in Trento is an alternative explanation. - Mod.EP  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/75).

The 1st involves a suspended grilled-meat restaurant in Yokohama Kanagawa prefecture, linked to the illnesses of a teenage girl and a man in his 80s who ate there on 30 Jul 2017.  The 2nd involves a deli in the Saitama Prefecture and a potato salad product sold at the Shokusaikan Marche Kagohara supermarket in Kumagaya. The potato salad has sickened 14, including a 5 year old girl who is in a critical condition along with 2 others who are severely ill.  The supermarket's deli  known as Derishasu Kagohara  purchased the potato salad from a food processing facility located outside the prefecture and then mixed it with cut pieces of ham and apples. Kumagaya Public Health has ordered the deli closed for 3 days while it investigates the source of the _E. coli_ infection and its distribution.  The investigation into the illness of a boy admitted to the Gunma Prefecture hospital on 14 Aug 2017 led to the deli's contamination. The deli appears to have sold the 1st suspect potato salad on 7-8 Aug 2017, after which 8 Saitama residents reported stomach pains. Others, ages 7 to 12, were treated for diarrhea.

The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare is advising tourists to go to hospital if they develop a high fever or generalized rash after returning to Japan.  Although the World Health Organization verified that Japan has eliminated infections of endemic measles strains in 2015, group infections originating from people who contracted the disease abroad are spreading in the country. As of 6 Aug 2017, the number of patients reached 169 this year in Japan, already eclipsing the figure in the previous year.  About 4100 patients in Italy and around 6500 patients in Romania have already been confirmed as of August 2017 compared with about 860 and 2000, respectively, throughout 2016, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.  Symptoms of the highly contagious disease include runny nose, red and watery eyes, high fever, and rash. The virus is spread through coughing and sneezing and can cause complications such as pneumonia and can even result in death in one in 1000 patients, according to the ministry. The ministry recommends people traveling overseas to check their vaccination records and take an additional shot if they have only been vaccinated once.  The disease was prevalent about a decade ago in Japan with the number of patients soaring to over 10 000 in 2008 but the country was later considered as free from infections of the virus.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Japan can be found at (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/156). - Mod.LK   <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Australia (Perth, Western Australia): ex Italy.

Large measles outbreak introduced by asylum seekers and spread among the insufficiently vaccinated resident population, Berlin, October 2014 to August 2015. Euro Surveill. 2017; 22(34): pii=30599 - Abstract  The largest measles outbreak in Berlin since 2001 occurred from October 2014 to August 2015. Overall, 1344 cases were ascertained, 86 per cent (with available information) unvaccinated, including 146 (12 per cent) asylum seekers. Median age was 17 years (interquartile range: 4-29 years), 26 per cent were hospitalised and a 1 year old child died. Measles virus genotyping uniformly revealed the variant 'D8-Rostov-Don' and descendants. The virus was likely introduced by and initially spread among asylum seekers before affecting Berlin's resident population. Among Berlin residents, the highest incidence was in children younger than 2 years, yet most cases (52 per cent) were adults. Post-exposure vaccinations in homes for asylum seekers, not always conducted, occurred later (median: 7.5 days) than the recommended 72 hours after onset of the 1st case and reached only half of potential contacts. Asylum seekers should not only have non-discriminatory, equitable access to vaccination, they also need to be offered measles vaccination in a timely fashion, that is, immediately upon arrival in the receiving country. Supplementary immunisation activities targeting the resident population, particularly adults, are urgently needed in Berlin.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail.

Source: Romania Insider (edited) (https://www.romania-insider.com/measles-kills-iraqi-refugee/)   The ongoing measles outbreak keeps making victims in Romania. A 10 month old girl, who was a refugee from Iraq, became the 33rd person to die of the infection, reports local Digi24. The girl arrived in Romania on 7 Jul 2017 with her family, and the doctors diagnosed her with measles in August. They also discovered that the child was suffering from malnutrition and severe psychomotor retardation.  The measles outbreak is still a major problem in Romania, with more than 8900 cases reported across the country until 25 Aug 2017, including 33 deaths, according to data from the National Center for Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases (CNSCBT). Most deaths were registered in Timis (9), Dolj (7), and Arad (6) counties.  Measles is a highly contagious respiratory infection caused by a virus. It causes a total-body skin rash and flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough, and runny nose. According to information posted on WHO's website, the virus is highly contagious, spreading by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact, and direct contact with infected nasal or throat secretions. Unvaccinated young children pose the highest risk of measles and its complications, including death.  The Romanian Government adopted earlier this month August 2017 a draft bill on the organization and financing of population vaccination (https://www.romania-insider.com/romania-draft-bill-vaccination/). The project was sent to the Parliament for approval and could come into force in January 2018.  byline: Irina Marica   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Measles tends to be more severe in children who are malnourished, especially children who are also vitamin A deficient. And complications are commoner and more serious in malnourished children. Because of complications such as diarrhoea, measles may lead to failure to thrive. Infection with measles virus may lead to kwashiorkor or marasmus in children who are underweight at the time that they get infected. Therefore, measles may result in, or aggravate, malnutrition.

Date: Sat 26 Aug 2017. Source: News-Medical/Life Sciences (edited) (https://www.news-medical.net/news/20170826/New-study-highlights-role-played-by-demographics-in-the-spread-of-measles.aspx)   Even if the incidence of measles infection has decreased by at least 90 per cent worldwide since the introduction of the vaccine, measles is still one of the major causes of death in children among vaccine-preventable diseases. Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world.  A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries.  Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years.  \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\"  \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea\".  The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years 2 million DALYs since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln 13 million DALYs in the US, and 36-mln 36 million DALYs in Ethiopia.  \"Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,\" continues Prof Melegaro \"our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population. Tailoring immunization campaigns to achieve measles eradication goals is essential and currently, for some countries, this means considering also the role of unprotected adolescents and young adults.\"   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Reference - Trentini F, Poletti P, Merler S, Melegaro A.

This came about after 2\nkidney recipients in Taiwan were diagnosed with dengue 2 days after\nreceiving a kidney each from the same donor, said National Cheng Kung\nUniversity microbiology and immunology professor Dr Oscar Perng\nGuey-chuen. \"This indicates a potential risk,\" the Taiwan-based\nscientist said, adding that no dengue virus was detected in the\ndonor's blood. He said the donor contracted dengue in 2015 and in mid-2016, he died\nin an accident. His family donated his corneas, liver, heart, and\nkidneys. Both patients had the same strain of the dengue virus the\ndonor had in 2015 and one of the recipients died of dengue\nhaemorrhagic fever, he said. Asked where the virus could be hiding since it could not be detected\nin the blood, he said it was a question scientists are trying to\nanswer. Interestingly, those who received the donor's corneas, liver,\nand heart did not develop dengue, Dr Perng said on the sidelines of\nthe National Dengue And Arboviruses Infection Conference 2017\nyesterday 12 Aug 2017. He said although there was not enough\nevidence to show the virus came from the donor as the kidneys were not\ntested for dengue before the transplant, the same virus was found in\nthe patients' bodies after that. Dr Perng said his team had studied mice for dengue virus in the blood\ntestes, kidney, liver, spleen and brain, and found the virus present\nin the kidneys and brain. \"We believe the virus probably resided in\nthe kidneys and was not cleared by the body,\" he said, adding that the\nvirus could have been activated after transplant. He said this raised\nconcerns about asymptomatic people who are dengue carriers. Health Ministry deputy director, general Datuk Dr S Jeyaindran said\npatients with severe dengue would have better recovery if they were\ngiven colloids, a more concentrated fluid, at the early stage in fluid\nmanagement for dengue patients. Dr Jeyaindran, who was representing\nHealth Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam, said colloids may be\nintroduced at an earlier stage, instead of saline because it has not\nbeen successful in treating patients with severe dengue. He said more\nstudies will be conducted to find out at which stage the colloids\nshould be given. byline: Loh Foon Fong \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) - Air travel related spread of dengue.\nDate: Thu 3 Aug 2017.\nSource: Medical Xpress (edited)\n(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-08-air-responsible-dengue-asia.html) \nWhile the incidences of many other infectious diseases have declined\nover the past decade, the number of cases and outbreaks of dengue\nvirus have continued to increase. The spread of dengue to new areas is\nlikely due in large part to trends in air travel, researchers now\nreport in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Dengue virus affects as estimated 390 million people around the globe\neach year, and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild fever and\nheadache to severe low blood pressure. The virus has mostly caused\ndisease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, but a 2014\noutbreak in Japan broke that pattern. Overall, the geographic area\naffected by dengue has been growing in recent years. In the new work, Huaiyu Tian and Bing Xu, both of Beijing Normal\nUniversity, China, together with colleagues from the University of\nOxford and elsewhere analyzed the spread of dengue viruses in Asia\nfrom 1956 to 2015. They used 2202 genetic sequences of dengue viruses,\ncollected in 20 countries or regions of Asia over the 59 years, to\ndetermine how different strains were related. They also investigated\ntrends in air travel, maritime mobility, migration, and\nsocio-economics to determine what factors impact the spread of\ndengue. The spread of 3 different dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1, -2, and -3,\nis associated with air traffic more so than any other factors, the\ndata revealed. Air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India, the\nresearchers found, help seed dengue epidemics, while China, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, and Singapore help diffuse the virus to other Asian\ncountries. \"Future trends in global mobility could potentially accelerate the\nappearance and diffusion of DENV worldwide,\" the researchers say.\n\"Prevention and control of dengue epidemics requires a better\nunderstanding of its mode of geographic dissemination, especially for\ncountries in the tropics.\" Reference: Tian H, Sun Z, Faria NR, et al.

The Kazakh edition of \"Ak Zhayik\" states that 120 cows died in the Isatay district of Atyrau region in the west of Kazakhstan map at (http://tinyurl.com/y9ksmu2x) in the period from 20 Jul to August 2017.  Veterinarians do not know the cause of the animal's deaths.\"Since the cattle are still in the pastures, the owners themselves bring sick animals to us. Although they do not have a high temperature, they still cannot save them,\" said veterinarian Islamgali Mardashev.  The meat of the dead cows was sent for testing in the laboratories of Astana and Almaty, but so far there are no results see comment below. It is only known that before dying the temperature of the animals rises, and there is weakness and lumps under the skin.  In the summer of 2016, the Atyrau oblast similarly suffered a massive loss of livestock; more than 800 cattle died. All of them had nodular dermatitis. More than 6000 cattle were infected with the disease.  byline: Alexandra Titova   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  From 10 to 15 Jun 2016, a disease which later was recognized as lumpy skin disease (LSD) was recorded in a cattle holding on the territory adjacent to the village of Chapayevo, West Kazakhstan (see archive no. http://promedmail.org/post/20160717.4350687; at this point in time, laymen, followed by the media, erroneously related to the undiagnosed and most probably unfamiliar new disease as foot and mouth disease. Please see relevant commentary in the subsequent postings no. http://promedmail.org/post/20160722.4362368 and http://promedmail.org/post/20160723.4365082).  On 7 Jul 2016, Kazakhstan reported (see archive no. http://promedmail.org/post/20160722.4363497) a single LSD outbreak in Makasch, Kurmangazinskiy, Mangashlak (western to Atyrau; map at (http://tinyurl.com/ycb4j9h7)), stating that it had started on 7 Jul 2016. According to the report, the susceptible population was 3557 head including 459 clinical cases of which 34 died, the 425 remaining sick animals \"killed and disposed of\". No stamping out applied and no additional case reported in the 12 follow-up reports, the last of which, no.12, submitted on 26 Nov 2017, stated: 1. Compensation to the animals' owners for dead cattle at the market price is being developed and will be implemented soon. All 459 diseased cattle heads were destroyed and the final disinfection was carried out. 2. The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted. Follow-up report no.12, with links to all previous reports, is available at (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=21682).  Although according to media reports vaccination was applied, no details of such were included in the 12 follow-up reports nor in Kazakhstan's semi-annual summary report to the OIE (July-December 2016), which included the epidemiological statistics above; the item \"control measures\" (against LSD) did not include \"vaccination\".  The current media report, from a Kyrgyz source (citing a Kazakh newspaper), says that during the 2016 event, 6000 animals were infected, of which 600 died. An earlier media report, from Kazakhstan, dated 27 Jul 2016, said that the number of diseased animals \"exceeded 2000, of which 50 head of cattle died\" (see archive no. http://promedmail.org/post/20160727.4374008).  Kazakhstan is the world's largest landlocked country, and the 9th largest in the world. The belated diagnosis in 2016, and its continued absence, so far, during the current event, is puzzling; following the acquiring of independence in Dec 1991, Kazakhstan obtained support from the West, particularly USA, in the establishment of state-of-the-art laboratories for research and diagnosis of infectious diseases in man and animals.  Early report on the factual circulation and distribution of LSD within Kazakhstan is anticipated. Neighboring countries may take steps to prevent its introduction; those countries include China, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. Russia is LSD-infected (last follow-up report addressing 2 new outbreaks in Saratov oblast, adjacent to West Kazakhstan, published 24 Aug 2017).  For the diagnosis of LSD, samples from clinically affected animals should preferably be derived from their typical dermal lesions; organs from dead animals which should be sent for laboratory tests are specified in OIE's Manual. The submission of \"meat of dead cows\" for testing in the laboratories, as reported, may not be ideal for timely diagnosis of LSD. - Mod.AS  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/46186).

It is understood that the government of Kazakhstan officially announced the presence, in 2017, of nodular dermatitis aka lumpy skin disease, LSD.  2. Russian and Kenyan LSD vaccines have been mentioned as the ones applied, and their effectiveness discussed.  3. Private owners of livestock suffer most, because the compensation for each sick cow is minimal. It is necessary to develop an effective compensation scheme for the smallholder livestock owners.  4. The following information on the 2016 LSD event in Kazakhstan was included in a report for the population, by the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic of Kazakhstan, AI Myrzahmetov, published on 2 Jun 2017: \"In 2016, 4 foci of nodular dermatitis outbreaks in cattle were reported in the Atyrau oblast. Amendments were made to the legislation and 185 million tenge (USD 551 300) were paid from the republican budget as compensation for the cost of animals that died from this disease. To date, all liquidation measures have been completed. Preventive vaccination of livestock in Atyrau oblast, as well as in 6 border areas of Aktobe Aqtobe (2) and West Kazakhstan (4) oblasts, are coming to an end.\"   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  ProMED-mail is very grateful to the submitter of the information above, addressing 4 issues raised in earlier postings on LSD in Kazakhstan.  The following comments address the issues as numbered above: 1. Additional details (link?) of the mentioned official confirmation, by Kazakhstan's authorities, of the current (2017) LSD event will be helpful. The internationally customary (in fact, required) route for such an announcement is an immediate notification to the OIE.  2. The LSD vaccine applied in Russia (and exported) is, in fact, a sheep-pox vaccine which, following a testing procedure, was recently licensed also for the vaccination of cattle against LSD (see http://promedmail.org/post/20170511.5028821).  The Kenyan O-240 vaccine has been recently found to include an LSD virus which underwent a low level of attenuation which may be not sufficient for safe use in cattle. It was suspected to cause clinical disease in vaccinated animals (see in http://promedmail.org/post/20140820.2708273).  EU countries currently use a live-homologous LSD vaccine (South-Africa's Neetling virus strain). A European Union LSD vaccine bank has become operational since April 2016. Trials assessing an inactivated vaccine were reportedly undertaken, currently in their final stages.  For a recent assessment of LSD vaccines, please see http://promedmail.org/post/20160812.4410864, including the commentary. OIE's Manual chapter on LSD, including exhaustive updated information, is available at (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.13_LSD.pdf).  3. This comment is of high significance. Small-holders, worldwide, may be slow, or even tempted to refrain altogether from reporting the appearance of early signs of a reportable animal disease, if they expect compensations to be under the real damages and payments delayed. Such animals may be (illegally) sold, with consequent spread of disease and  eventually  higher national losses and expenditures.  4. The original text, in Kazakh and Russian, is available in Kazakhstan's Ministry of Agriculture blog, at (http://tinyurl.com/ydbgtg6k). In case the recent media reports on LSD spreading in Western Kazakhstan are confirmed, it will be of interest to note if the affected farms included vaccinated animals and which vaccines were used.  Kazakhstan's official reporting on the 2016 LSD event was limited to a solitary notification on a single outbreak; no details of the vaccination (numbers and vaccinated animals, geography) were included.  According to the recent official update, LSD was recorded, during 2016, in 4 locations within the Atyrau oblast.  Timely and detailed information on the LSD situation in Kazakhstan is essential for the entire region. This applies also for another livestock disease suspected to be spreading in central Asia, namely PPR (peste des petits ruminants) in small ruminants. - Mod.AS  Maps of Kazakhstan can be seen at (https://kazakhstan.orexca.com/img/kazakhstan_map.gif) and (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/46186). - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ  ","keywordsMatched":[]},"154":{"title":"Lumpy skin disease - Europe (08): Russia (OB) bovine,\r\n\tKazakhstan (AR) susp.

Two vaccines are being applied in Kazakhstan to protect cattle against LSD: a. A Russian sheep pox vaccine (effectiveness under question) with unknown dosage; b.

The information on a Kenyan vaccine as being applied in Kazakhstan is not confirmed.  2. In the absence of official diagnosis of LSD, farmers will not be entitled to receive compensation. However, in Kazakhstan, they may diagnose \"pasteurellosis,\" and people will get their compensation that way. In such case, one will not know whether the actual case was related to LSD or another etiological disease agent.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. \n(promed@promedmail.org)  ProMED-mail is indebted to the submitter of the above information.

Kazakhstan's compliance with OIE standards, the quality of its national Veterinary Services for a timely and accurate diagnosis of suspected animal diseases, which is essential for their control, prevention and official notification; and the appropriateness of the country's veterinary legislation have been visited in the framework of OIE's PVS Pathway (see (http://www.oie.int/support-to-oie-members/pvs-pathway/)). Following visits of OIE's experts missions, comprehensive evaluation reports of the visited countries are issued, indicating and allowing required improvements or, ideally, confirming the satisfactory prevailing situations.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness\nand disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE,\nAtay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral\nrehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and\nother forms of diarrhea: \"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that\ncholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement,\nand, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not\nuntil 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of\nthe intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could\nbe effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the\nintravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could\nbe just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for\nexample, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy\n(ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the\nmorbidity and mortality of cholera.

The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare is advising tourists to go to hospital if they develop a high fever or generalized rash after returning to Japan.  Although the World Health Organization verified that Japan has eliminated infections of endemic measles strains in 2015, group infections originating from people who contracted the disease abroad are spreading in the country. As of 6 Aug 2017, the number of patients reached 169 this year in Japan, already eclipsing the figure in the previous year.  About 4100 patients in Italy and around 6500 patients in Romania have already been confirmed as of August 2017 compared with about 860 and 2000, respectively, throughout 2016, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.  Symptoms of the highly contagious disease include runny nose, red and watery eyes, high fever, and rash. The virus is spread through coughing and sneezing and can cause complications such as pneumonia and can even result in death in one in 1000 patients, according to the ministry. The ministry recommends people traveling overseas to check their vaccination records and take an additional shot if they have only been vaccinated once.  The disease was prevalent about a decade ago in Japan with the number of patients soaring to over 10 000 in 2008 but the country was later considered as free from infections of the virus.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Japan can be found at (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/156). - Mod.LK   <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Australia (Perth, Western Australia): ex Italy.

Large measles outbreak introduced by asylum seekers and spread among the insufficiently vaccinated resident population, Berlin, October 2014 to August 2015. Euro Surveill. 2017; 22(34): pii=30599 - Abstract  The largest measles outbreak in Berlin since 2001 occurred from October 2014 to August 2015. Overall, 1344 cases were ascertained, 86 per cent (with available information) unvaccinated, including 146 (12 per cent) asylum seekers. Median age was 17 years (interquartile range: 4-29 years), 26 per cent were hospitalised and a 1 year old child died. Measles virus genotyping uniformly revealed the variant 'D8-Rostov-Don' and descendants. The virus was likely introduced by and initially spread among asylum seekers before affecting Berlin's resident population. Among Berlin residents, the highest incidence was in children younger than 2 years, yet most cases (52 per cent) were adults. Post-exposure vaccinations in homes for asylum seekers, not always conducted, occurred later (median: 7.5 days) than the recommended 72 hours after onset of the 1st case and reached only half of potential contacts. Asylum seekers should not only have non-discriminatory, equitable access to vaccination, they also need to be offered measles vaccination in a timely fashion, that is, immediately upon arrival in the receiving country. Supplementary immunisation activities targeting the resident population, particularly adults, are urgently needed in Berlin.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail.

Source: Romania Insider (edited) (https://www.romania-insider.com/measles-kills-iraqi-refugee/)   The ongoing measles outbreak keeps making victims in Romania. A 10 month old girl, who was a refugee from Iraq, became the 33rd person to die of the infection, reports local Digi24. The girl arrived in Romania on 7 Jul 2017 with her family, and the doctors diagnosed her with measles in August. They also discovered that the child was suffering from malnutrition and severe psychomotor retardation.  The measles outbreak is still a major problem in Romania, with more than 8900 cases reported across the country until 25 Aug 2017, including 33 deaths, according to data from the National Center for Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases (CNSCBT). Most deaths were registered in Timis (9), Dolj (7), and Arad (6) counties.  Measles is a highly contagious respiratory infection caused by a virus. It causes a total-body skin rash and flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough, and runny nose. According to information posted on WHO's website, the virus is highly contagious, spreading by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact, and direct contact with infected nasal or throat secretions. Unvaccinated young children pose the highest risk of measles and its complications, including death.  The Romanian Government adopted earlier this month August 2017 a draft bill on the organization and financing of population vaccination (https://www.romania-insider.com/romania-draft-bill-vaccination/). The project was sent to the Parliament for approval and could come into force in January 2018.  byline: Irina Marica   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Measles tends to be more severe in children who are malnourished, especially children who are also vitamin A deficient. And complications are commoner and more serious in malnourished children. Because of complications such as diarrhoea, measles may lead to failure to thrive. Infection with measles virus may lead to kwashiorkor or marasmus in children who are underweight at the time that they get infected. Therefore, measles may result in, or aggravate, malnutrition.

Date: Sat 26 Aug 2017. Source: News-Medical/Life Sciences (edited) (https://www.news-medical.net/news/20170826/New-study-highlights-role-played-by-demographics-in-the-spread-of-measles.aspx)   Even if the incidence of measles infection has decreased by at least 90 per cent worldwide since the introduction of the vaccine, measles is still one of the major causes of death in children among vaccine-preventable diseases. Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world.  A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries.  Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years.  \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\"  \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea\".  The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years 2 million DALYs since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln 13 million DALYs in the US, and 36-mln 36 million DALYs in Ethiopia.  \"Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,\" continues Prof Melegaro \"our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population. Tailoring immunization campaigns to achieve measles eradication goals is essential and currently, for some countries, this means considering also the role of unprotected adolescents and young adults.\"   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Reference - Trentini F, Poletti P, Merler S, Melegaro A.

The\nfollowing is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In:\nChronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract.\nGreydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in\npress): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons,\nvaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside\nof Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as\n60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection\nlengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:\n- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam;\n- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however,\nhave suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be\neffective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and\noutbreak situations (63, 64). \"References\n\n57.

The Kazakh edition of \"Ak Zhayik\" states that 120 cows died in the Isatay district of Atyrau region in the west of Kazakhstan map at (http://tinyurl.com/y9ksmu2x) in the period from 20 Jul to August 2017.  Veterinarians do not know the cause of the animal's deaths.\"Since the cattle are still in the pastures, the owners themselves bring sick animals to us. Although they do not have a high temperature, they still cannot save them,\" said veterinarian Islamgali Mardashev.  The meat of the dead cows was sent for testing in the laboratories of Astana and Almaty, but so far there are no results see comment below. It is only known that before dying the temperature of the animals rises, and there is weakness and lumps under the skin.  In the summer of 2016, the Atyrau oblast similarly suffered a massive loss of livestock; more than 800 cattle died. All of them had nodular dermatitis. More than 6000 cattle were infected with the disease.  byline: Alexandra Titova   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  From 10 to 15 Jun 2016, a disease which later was recognized as lumpy skin disease (LSD) was recorded in a cattle holding on the territory adjacent to the village of Chapayevo, West Kazakhstan (see archive no. http://promedmail.org/post/20160717.4350687; at this point in time, laymen, followed by the media, erroneously related to the undiagnosed and most probably unfamiliar new disease as foot and mouth disease. Please see relevant commentary in the subsequent postings no. http://promedmail.org/post/20160722.4362368 and http://promedmail.org/post/20160723.4365082).  On 7 Jul 2016, Kazakhstan reported (see archive no. http://promedmail.org/post/20160722.4363497) a single LSD outbreak in Makasch, Kurmangazinskiy, Mangashlak (western to Atyrau; map at (http://tinyurl.com/ycb4j9h7)), stating that it had started on 7 Jul 2016. According to the report, the susceptible population was 3557 head including 459 clinical cases of which 34 died, the 425 remaining sick animals \"killed and disposed of\". No stamping out applied and no additional case reported in the 12 follow-up reports, the last of which, no.12, submitted on 26 Nov 2017, stated: 1. Compensation to the animals' owners for dead cattle at the market price is being developed and will be implemented soon. All 459 diseased cattle heads were destroyed and the final disinfection was carried out. 2. The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted. Follow-up report no.12, with links to all previous reports, is available at (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=21682).  Although according to media reports vaccination was applied, no details of such were included in the 12 follow-up reports nor in Kazakhstan's semi-annual summary report to the OIE (July-December 2016), which included the epidemiological statistics above; the item \"control measures\" (against LSD) did not include \"vaccination\".  The current media report, from a Kyrgyz source (citing a Kazakh newspaper), says that during the 2016 event, 6000 animals were infected, of which 600 died. An earlier media report, from Kazakhstan, dated 27 Jul 2016, said that the number of diseased animals \"exceeded 2000, of which 50 head of cattle died\" (see archive no. http://promedmail.org/post/20160727.4374008).  Kazakhstan is the world's largest landlocked country, and the 9th largest in the world. The belated diagnosis in 2016, and its continued absence, so far, during the current event, is puzzling; following the acquiring of independence in Dec 1991, Kazakhstan obtained support from the West, particularly USA, in the establishment of state-of-the-art laboratories for research and diagnosis of infectious diseases in man and animals.  Early report on the factual circulation and distribution of LSD within Kazakhstan is anticipated. Neighboring countries may take steps to prevent its introduction; those countries include China, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. Russia is LSD-infected (last follow-up report addressing 2 new outbreaks in Saratov oblast, adjacent to West Kazakhstan, published 24 Aug 2017).  For the diagnosis of LSD, samples from clinically affected animals should preferably be derived from their typical dermal lesions; organs from dead animals which should be sent for laboratory tests are specified in OIE's Manual. The submission of \"meat of dead cows\" for testing in the laboratories, as reported, may not be ideal for timely diagnosis of LSD. - Mod.AS  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/46186).

This came about after 2\nkidney recipients in Taiwan were diagnosed with dengue 2 days after\nreceiving a kidney each from the same donor, said National Cheng Kung\nUniversity microbiology and immunology professor Dr Oscar Perng\nGuey-chuen. \"This indicates a potential risk,\" the Taiwan-based\nscientist said, adding that no dengue virus was detected in the\ndonor's blood. He said the donor contracted dengue in 2015 and in mid-2016, he died\nin an accident. His family donated his corneas, liver, heart, and\nkidneys. Both patients had the same strain of the dengue virus the\ndonor had in 2015 and one of the recipients died of dengue\nhaemorrhagic fever, he said. Asked where the virus could be hiding since it could not be detected\nin the blood, he said it was a question scientists are trying to\nanswer. Interestingly, those who received the donor's corneas, liver,\nand heart did not develop dengue, Dr Perng said on the sidelines of\nthe National Dengue And Arboviruses Infection Conference 2017\nyesterday 12 Aug 2017. He said although there was not enough\nevidence to show the virus came from the donor as the kidneys were not\ntested for dengue before the transplant, the same virus was found in\nthe patients' bodies after that. Dr Perng said his team had studied mice for dengue virus in the blood\ntestes, kidney, liver, spleen and brain, and found the virus present\nin the kidneys and brain. \"We believe the virus probably resided in\nthe kidneys and was not cleared by the body,\" he said, adding that the\nvirus could have been activated after transplant. He said this raised\nconcerns about asymptomatic people who are dengue carriers. Health Ministry deputy director, general Datuk Dr S Jeyaindran said\npatients with severe dengue would have better recovery if they were\ngiven colloids, a more concentrated fluid, at the early stage in fluid\nmanagement for dengue patients. Dr Jeyaindran, who was representing\nHealth Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam, said colloids may be\nintroduced at an earlier stage, instead of saline because it has not\nbeen successful in treating patients with severe dengue.

The spread of dengue to new areas is\nlikely due in large part to trends in air travel, researchers now\nreport in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Dengue virus affects as estimated 390 million people around the globe\neach year, and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild fever and\nheadache to severe low blood pressure. The virus has mostly caused\ndisease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, but a 2014\noutbreak in Japan broke that pattern. Overall, the geographic area\naffected by dengue has been growing in recent years. In the new work, Huaiyu Tian and Bing Xu, both of Beijing Normal\nUniversity, China, together with colleagues from the University of\nOxford and elsewhere analyzed the spread of dengue viruses in Asia\nfrom 1956 to 2015. They used 2202 genetic sequences of dengue viruses,\ncollected in 20 countries or regions of Asia over the 59 years, to\ndetermine how different strains were related. They also investigated\ntrends in air travel, maritime mobility, migration, and\nsocio-economics to determine what factors impact the spread of\ndengue. The spread of 3 different dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1, -2, and -3,\nis associated with air traffic more so than any other factors, the\ndata revealed. Air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India, the\nresearchers found, help seed dengue epidemics, while China, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, and Singapore help diffuse the virus to other Asian\ncountries. \"Future trends in global mobility could potentially accelerate the\nappearance and diffusion of DENV worldwide,\" the researchers say.\n\"Prevention and control of dengue epidemics requires a better\nunderstanding of its mode of geographic dissemination, especially for\ncountries in the tropics.\" Reference: Tian H, Sun Z, Faria NR, et al.

NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in\npress): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons,\nvaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside\nof Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as\n60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection\nlengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:\n- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam;\n- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however,\nhave suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be\neffective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and\noutbreak situations (63, 64). \"References\n\n57.

The recent outbreaks of ZIKV in Brazil and French\nPolynesia have been linked to a considerable increase in the incidence\nof fetal microcephaly and other diseases such as Guillain-Barre\nsyndrome. Because there is currently no specific therapy or vaccine,\nthe early exploitation of a method to prevent expansion of ZIKV is a\nhigh priority. To validate commonly used antiviral drugs, we evaluated\nthe effect of ribavirin, a drug used to treat hepatitis C with\ninterferon-beta (IFN-beta), on ZIKV replication. In mammalian cells,\nwe observed an inhibitory effect of ribavirin on ZIKV replication and\nZIKV-induced cell death without cytotoxic effect. Furthermore, we\nfound that STAT1-deficient mice, which lack type I IFN signaling, were\nhighly sensitive to ZIKV infection and exhibited lethal outcome.\nRibavirin abrogated viremia in ZIKV-infected STAT-1-deficient mice.\nThese data suggest that the inhibition of viral RNA-dependent RNA\npolymerases may be effective for treatment of ZIKV infection. Our data\nprovide a new insight into the mechanisms for inhibition of ZIKV\nreplication and prevention of Zika fever. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) It will be interesting to see if these encouraging results showing\ninhibition of Zika virus replication can be replicated in non-human\nprimates. The challenge for use of drugs to inhibit Zika virus\ninfection in humans is that most (around 80 percent) Zika virus\ninfections are asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms. These\nindividuals will probably not seek medical treatment, even though\ntheir fetuses are at risk of infection with teratogenic effects. -\nMod.TY \n<br><br><strong>{3}</strong> Zika virus skewed immunosuppression.\nDate: Mon 21 Aug 2017.\nSource: Nature Microbiology journal (edited)\n(http://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-017-0016-3) \nref: Foo SS, Chen W, Chan Y, et al. Asian Zika virus strains target\nCD14+ blood monocytes and induce M2-skewed immunosuppression during\npregnancy. Nat Microbiol. 2017. doi: 10.1038/s41564-017-0016-3\n-\nAbstract\nBlood CD14+ monocytes are frontline immunomodulators categorized into\nclassical, intermediate or non-classical subsets, and subsequently\ndifferentiated into M1 pro- or M2 anti-inflammatory macrophages on\nstimulation. Although the Zika virus (ZIKV) rapidly establishes\nviraemia, the target cells and immune responses, particularly during\npregnancy, remain elusive. Furthermore, it is unknown whether African-\nand Asian-lineage ZIKV have different phenotypic impacts on host\nimmune responses. Using human blood infection, we identified CD14+\nmonocytes as the primary target for African- or Asian-lineage ZIKV\ninfection. When immunoprofiles of human blood infected with ZIKV were\ncompared, a classical/intermediate monocyte-mediated M1-skewed\ninflammation by the African-lineage ZIKV infection was observed, in\ncontrast to a non-classical monocyte-mediated M2-skewed\nimmunosuppression by the Asian-lineage ZIKV infection. Importantly,\ninfection of the blood of pregnant women revealed an enhanced\nsusceptibility to ZIKV infection. Specifically, Asian-lineage ZIKV\ninfection of pregnant women's blood led to an exacerbated M2-skewed\nimmunosuppression of non-classical monocytes in conjunction with a\nglobal suppression of type I interferon-signaling pathway and an\naberrant expression of host genes associated with pregnancy\ncomplications. Also, 30 ZIKV+ sera from symptomatic pregnant patients\nshowed elevated levels of M2-skewed immunosuppressive cytokines and\npregnancy-complication-associated fibronectin-1. This study\ndemonstrates the differential immunomodulatory responses of blood\nmonocytes, particularly during pregnancy, on infection with different\nlineages of ZIKV. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{4}</strong> Virus alters mosquito genes.\nDate: Tue 22 Aug 2017.\nSource: bioRxiv journal (edited)\n(http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/22/179416) \nref: Etebari K, Hegde S, Saldana MA, et al. Global transcriptome\nanalysis of _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes in response to Zika virus\ninfection. bioRxiv 179416; doi:10.1101/179416\n-\nZika virus (ZIKV) of the Flaviviridae family is a recently emerged\nmosquito-borne virus that has been implicated in the surge of the\nnumber of microcephaly instances in South America. The recent rapid\nspread of the virus led to its declaration as a global health\nemergency by the World Health Organization. The virus is transmitted\nmainly by the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_ that also vectors dengue virus,\nhowever little is known about the interactions of the virus with the\nmosquito vector. In this study, we investigated the transcriptome\nprofiles of whole _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes in response to ZIKV\ninfection at 2, 7, and 14 days post-infection using RNA-Seq. Results\nshowed changes in the abundance of a large number of transcripts at\neach time point following infection, with 18 transcripts commonly\nchanged among the 3 time points. Gene ontology analysis revealed that\nmost of the altered genes are involved in metabolic process, cellular\nprocess and proteolysis. In addition, 486 long intergenic non-coding\nRNAs were identified altered upon ZIKV infection. Further, we found\ncorrelational changes of a number of potential mRNA target genes with\nthat of altered host microRNAs. The outcomes provide a basic\nunderstanding of _Ae. aegypti_ responses to ZIKV and helps to\ndetermine host factors involved in replication or mosquito host\nanti-viral response against the virus. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) Mosquito vector competence depends on the relationship of virus and\nthe mosquito, and the defenses that the mosquito can mobilize against\nthe virus infection. Studies, such as the one above, can document the\nchanges that occur when the virus infects the mosquito, and if\ndifferences in relative vector efficiency of different geographic\nstrains of this mosquito might be related to alternations in mosquito\ngenes when infected. It would be interesting to know if these gene\nchanges affect fitness, and especially longevity of infected\nmosquitoes. - Mod.TY \n<br><br><strong>{5}</strong> Virus effects on sperm, body fluids.\nDate: Mon 21 Aug 2017.\nSource: The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal (edited)\n(http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(17)30444-9/abstract) \nref: Joguet G, Mansuy JM, Matusali G, et al.

To investigate the effects of Zika\nvirus infection on semen and clearance of Zika virus from semen and\nbody fluids, we aimed to study a cohort of Zika virus-infected men. Methods\nThis prospective observational study recruited men presenting with\nacute Zika virus infection at Pointe-Ã -Pitre University Hospital in\nGuadeloupe, French Caribbean, where a Zika virus outbreak occurred\nbetween April and November, 2016. Blood, urine, and semen were\ncollected at days 7, 11, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 after symptom onset,\nand semen characteristics, such as total sperm count, sperm motility,\nvitality, and morphology, and reproductive hormone concentrations,\nsuch as testosterone, inhibin, follicle-stimulating hormone, and\nluteinising hormone, were assessed. At days 7, 11, and 20, semen was\nprocessed to isolate motile spermatozoa. Zika virus RNA was detected\nby RT-PCR using whole blood, serum, urine, seminal plasma, semen\ncells, and motile spermatozoa fractions. Zika virus was isolated from\ndifferent sperm fractions on Vero E6 cultures. Findings\n15 male volunteers (mean age 35 years SD 5; range 25-44) with acute\nZika virus infection and positive Zika virus RNA detection in blood or\nurine were enrolled. Total sperm count was decreased from median\n119âÃâ10^6 spermatozoa (IQR interquartile range 22-234)\nat day 7, to 45.2âÃâ10^6 (16.5-89.6) at day 30, and 70\nÃ 10^6 (28.5-81.4) at day 60, respectively, after Zika virus\ninfection. Inhibin values increased from 93.5 pg/mL (IQR 55-162) at\nday 7 to 150 pg/mL (78-209) at day 120 when total sperm count\nrecovered. In motile spermatozoa obtained after density gradient\nseparation, Zika virus RNA was found in 3 of 14 patients at day 7, 4\nof 15 at day 11, and 4 of 15 at day 20, and replication-competent\nvirus was found in the tested patient. Seminal shedding kinetics\nseemed heterogeneous among patients. Whole blood was the fluid most\nfrequently positive for Zika virus RNA (62 of 92 samples) and 3\npatients remained positive at day 120. Interpretation\nSemen alterations early after acute Zika virus infection might affect\nfertility and could be explained by virus effects on the testis and\nepididymis. Frequency of shedding and high viral load in semen,\ntogether with the presence of replicative virus in a motile\nspermatozoa fraction, can lead to Zika virus transmission during\nsexual contact and assisted reproduction procedures. Whole blood seems\nto be the best specimen for Zika virus RNA detection, diagnosis, and\nfollow-up. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall In a new study that included 12 men in French Guiana who had Zika\nvirus, 4 never had any detectable Zika in their semen, 1 excreted Zika\nvirus in his semen for at least 3 days, and 7 had Zika virus in semen\nfor at least 1 month.

Vaccines protect fetus from Zika. JAMA. 2017; 318(8):\n689. doi:10.1001/jama.2017.11200\n-\nResearchers funded in part by the National Institutes of Health have\nrecently demonstrated that 2 experimental vaccines can restrict\ntransmission of Zika virus from pregnant mice to their fetuses,\nthereby shielding offspring from congenital damage or death. Multiple candidate Zika vaccines have been shown protective against\ninfection with the virus in animal studies, with several now in human\ntrials, but none were tested in the context of pregnancy, according to\nthe authors of the study published in Cell\n(http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(17)30759-6). The 2\nvaccine candidates investigated in the new study are the 1st to\ndemonstrate efficacy in preventing vertical transmission of the virus\nand related fetal death in an animal model. Although the vaccines were\nadministered to female mice prior to pregnancy, the result is\nconsidered an important step toward developing a vaccine that could be\nsafely given to pregnant women. One of the 2 candidates is a modified messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine\nencoding Zika genes, developed by the biotechnology company Moderna.\nIt is already in safety trials in women who are not pregnant. The\nother is a live-attenuated Zika strain developed by researchers at the\nUniversity of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). The testing was carried out by scientists from the National Institute\nof Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Washington University School of\nMedicine, and UTMB. The researchers 1st vaccinated the mice with 1 of\nthe vaccines or a placebo. After mating, the animals were challenged\nwith the virus 6 days into pregnancy. A week later, more than 50\npercent of placentas and fetuses from mice administered the mRNA\nvaccine had virtually no Zika RNA. The remainder had \"substantially\nlower\" levels relative to placebo.\nThe live vaccine provided broader protection: 78 percent of placentas\nand 83 percent of fetuses had Zika RNA at or below the level of\ndetection, while the placebo group exhibited significantly higher\nlevels of placental and fetal Zika RNA. Mice vaccinated with either\nvaccine had significantly higher rates of fetal viability; whereas 100\npercent of fetuses from mice vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine were\nborn, none survived to term in the placebo group. A working group funded by the Wellcome Trust recently approved ethical\nguidelines for testing such vaccines in pregnant women, normally\nexcluded from drug trials. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) It is reassuring to learn that at least 2 vaccines are now entering\nclinical trials in women. Although anti-Zika virus drugs are under\ndevelopment, preventing infection through vaccination seems to be the\nmost effective measure to prevent fetal infection and adverse effects\nof the virus infection in adults. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Mauritania":{"126":{"title":"Undiagnosed hemorrhagic illness - Mauritania: (TR) RFI\r\n\t","date":["24","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH/EDR> Undiagnosed hemorrhagic illness - Mauritania: (TR) RFI\r\n\t[EXTERNAL]","summary":"\nUNDIAGNOSED HEMORRHAGIC ILLNESS - MAURITANIA: (TRARZA) REQUEST FOR\nINFORMATION\n\nA ProMED-mail post\n(http://www.promedmail.org)\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n(http://www.isid.org).

Source: Outbreak News Today (edited) (http://outbreaknewstoday.com/mauritania-reports-confirmed-crimean-congo-hemorrhagic-fever-case-21416/)   On 24 Aug 2017, the Mauritania Ministry of Health notified WHO of a confirmed case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in a 47-year-old shepherd, from Arafat Village in Mohammedia, Boutilimit Prefecture, located about 150 km southeast of the capital, Nouakchott.  In May 2017, health officials reported 2 imported cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in Senegal imported from Mauritania. A 3rd imported case was reported in June 2017.  He developed headache, muscle and joints pains and diarrhea on 20 Aug 2017 and sought medical attention. He was treated with anti-malarial medicines and analgesics.  After 2 days, he returned for medical care as his condition worsened. He was tested for CCHF because of bleeding manifestations and was IgM positive for Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The patient is still hospitalized and in stable clinical condition.  Mauritania experienced a fairly large CCHF outbreak in 2003, involving 38 cases with a case fatality rate of 28.6 percent. According to the WHO, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is a widespread disease caused by a tick-borne virus (Nairovirus) of the Bunyaviridae family. The CCHF virus causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 percent.  CCHF is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and Asian countries south of the 50th parallel north, the geographical limit of the principal tick vector. The hosts of the CCHF virus include a wide range of wild and domestic animals such as cattle, sheep and goats.  Animals become infected by the bite of infected ticks, and the virus remains in their bloodstream for about one week after infection, allowing the tick-animal-tick cycle to continue when another tick bites. Although a number of tick genera are capable of becoming infected with CCHF virus, ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_ are the principal vectors.  The CCHF virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians. Human-to-human transmission is possible.  Byline: Robert Herriman   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  An outbreak of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever was documented in Nouakchott, the capital of Mauritania in 2003. The index case was detected on 18 Feb 2003. By 21 Mar 2003, the Ministry of Health of Mauritania had reported a total of 35 cases (18 laboratory confirmed) of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), including 6 deaths Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever - Mauritania (04) http://promedmail.org/post/20030324.0732.  In the period from February to August 2003, 38 persons were infected with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus; 35 of these persons were residents of Nouakchott. The 1st patient was a young woman who became ill shortly after butchering a goat. She transmitted the infection to 15 persons in the hospital where she was admitted and 4 members of her family. In Nouakchott, 2 disease clusters and 11 isolated cases were identified. Of the patients not infected by the 1st case-patient, almost half were butchers, which suggests that the primary mode of animal-to-human transmission was direct contact with blood of infected animals.  Cattle heavily infested with ticks were more likely to be CCHFV seropositive, and vector control to reduce the tick burden can result in reduced seroprevalence. Cattle are noted as the most sensitive indicator of low-level CCHFV circulation because they tend to be highly infested with _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks, which are the most common vectors of CCHF (http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0004210).  The circulation of CCHF virus and the high prevalence of infected animals and ticks have been well documented in Mauritanian farming areas since 1983 Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever and Rift Valley fever in south-eastern Mauritania.

(https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/9/17-0523_article)   Antimicrobial drug-resistant Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ infections, Michigan, USA  Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ (STEC) also called enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ - EHEC - Mod.LL contributes to 265 000 cases of foodborne illness annually in the USA (1). Most infections are caused by O157 strains; however, non-O157 EHEC infections have increased (2). Antimicrobial drug resistance among EHEC has been reported (3-5) but is probably underestimated. Given the importance of resistance in _E. coli_ pathotypes, we sought to determine the prevalence of resistant EHEC infections and assess the effects of resistance on disease.  We obtained 358 STEC isolates from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) Reference Laboratory (Lansing, MI, USA), collected during 2010-2014. Of these, 14 were outbreak associated. We examined one strain per outbreak using protocols approved by Michigan State University and MDHHS. Overall, 31 (8.8 per cent) strains (23 non-O157, 8 O157) were resistant to antimicrobial drugs (table for table and figures, see original URL - Mod.LL). Resistance to ampicillin (7.4 per cent) was the commonest, followed by trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT) (4.0 per cent) and ciprofloxacin (0.3 per cent). Compared with national rates, resistance to ampicillin and SXT was higher, but not significantly different, for O157 isolates from Michigan (figure 1) (6). One strain was resistant to all drugs, and all resistant strains had high MICs (ampicillin, )64 ug/mL; ciprofloxacin, )32 ug/mL; SXT, in 1:19 ratio, )32/608 ug/mL). Notably, resistance was twice as common for non-O157 (11.1 per cent) than for O157 (5.5 per cent) strains. O111 strains (n=7) had significantly higher resistance frequencies (24.1 per cent) than other non-O157 serogroups (p=0.03). We found variation by year and season; resistance frequencies were highest in 2012 (figure 2) and during winter/spring (table 1), but neither trend was significant. We also observed a strong but nonsignificant association between resistance and hospitalization but no association for urban versus rural residence (7) or county after stratifying by prescription rates (8) in the univariate analyses.  We conducted a multivariate analysis using logistic regression, with hospitalization as the dependent variable; we included variables with significant (p(0.05) and strong (p(0.20) associations from the univariate analysis as independent variables. Forward selection indicated that hospitalized patients were more likely to have resistant infections (odds ratio OR 2.4, 95 per cent confidence interval CI 1.00-5.82) and less likely to have non-O157 infections (OR 0.4, CI 0.21-0.61) (table 2), suggesting that resistant infections or O157 infections may cause more severe clinical outcomes. Patients over 18 years of age, women, and patients with bloody diarrhea were also more likely to be hospitalized.  Although we found no significant difference by stx profile, strains possessing stx1 only were more commonly resistant than strains with stx2 alone (p=0.27 by Fisher exact test). All 23 (100 per cent) resistant non-O157 EHEC and 1 (12.5 per cent) resistant O157 strain had stx1 only. Strains positive for eae were less likely to be resistant (n=27; 8.4 per cent) than eae-negative strains (n=4; 23.5 per cent); this nonsignificant difference (p=0.07 by Fisher exact test) could be due to small sample sizes. All 8 resistant O157 strains and 18 (78.3 per cent) of 23 resistant non-O157 strains had eae, demonstrating correlations between virulence genes and serogroups.  Overall, we detected a high frequency of resistance among non-O157 EHEC (11.2 per cent), similar to findings from Mexico (15 per cent), although we evaluated fewer drugs (5). Resistance to ciprofloxacin was low despite its routine use for treating enteric infections, perhaps because resistance development in _E. coli_ requires multiple mutations (9). Resistance frequencies in EHEC were low relative to other _E. coli_ pathotypes such as extraintestinal _E. coli_, which may be attributable to differences in the source of the infections (3).  The higher O157 resistance frequencies in Michigan than nationwide indicate that selection pressures vary by location and source. Although we observed no difference in resistance frequencies for counties with high versus low antimicrobial drug prescription rates (8), we have not investigated selection pressures from drug use in farm environments that may affect resistance emergence in Michigan. Approximately 12 million kg of antimicrobial drugs are administered to food animals annually in the USA; roughly 61 per cent of these are medically relevant. Higher resistance frequencies in winter/spring (12.2 per cent) than summer/fall (7.5 per cent) could be attributed to variation in prescription rates by season (10).  Because Michigan is not part of the CDC Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network and resistance in EHEC has not been widely researched, data about the prevalence and impact of resistance are lacking. This study detected a high frequency of EHEC resistance to antimicrobial drugs commonly used in human and veterinary medicine, particularly for non-O157 serotypes, which have increased in frequency (2). Monitoring resistance in EHEC is essential because of the risk of transmitting resistant strains from food animals to humans and the high likelihood of horizontal transfer of resistance genes from EHEC to other pathogens. Routine monitoring can uncover new treatment approaches and guide development of strategies for controlling emergence and spread of resistance in EHEC and other _E. coli_ pathotypes.  References - 1.

(promed@promedmail.org)  The degree of antimicrobial resistance in this report seems no more than what is seen in community-acquired non-EHEC infections.  Regarding the use of antimicrobials in EHEC is often a moot point since in most cases they are not utilized, at least early, because of the increased risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome but is relevant in cases where embarrassment of the colonic lumen occurs. In the large _E. coli_ O104:H4 outbreak in northern Germany, antimicrobial therapy was used especially in those cases where the colon was perforated. In those reports, the carbapenem antimicrobials also did not increase toxin production. Whether these effects are strain specific is not clear at this time so should not necessarily be generalized to all EHEC. Of note, the _E. coli_ O104:H4 strain is a genetic hybrid between EHEC and enteroaggregative _E. coli_ and not thought to be a zoonosis.  Extraintestinal invasive strains of EHEC (ProMED-mail. E. coli EHEC - France: O80:H2, hybrid invasive pathogen, 2005-2014 http://promedmail.org/post/20160909.4474015 and other reports) indeed introduces another layer of concern about these infections. - Mod.LL  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/225).

Antiviral Res. 2017; 146: 1-11.\ndoi: 10.1016/j.antiviral.2017.08.007\n-\nHighlights\n- Ribavirin inhibits ZIKV replication in mammalian cells.\n- Ribavirin prevents ZIKV-induced apoptosis and cell death.\n- Ribavirin administration abrogates viremia in ZIKV-infected\nSTAT1-deficient mice.\n- Leading to a prolonged survival.\nAbstract\nZika fever, a mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by Zika virus\n(ZIKV), is an epidemic disease for which no effective therapy has been\nestablished. The recent outbreaks of ZIKV in Brazil and French\nPolynesia have been linked to a considerable increase in the incidence\nof fetal microcephaly and other diseases such as Guillain-Barre\nsyndrome. Because there is currently no specific therapy or vaccine,\nthe early exploitation of a method to prevent expansion of ZIKV is a\nhigh priority. To validate commonly used antiviral drugs, we evaluated\nthe effect of ribavirin, a drug used to treat hepatitis C with\ninterferon-beta (IFN-beta), on ZIKV replication. In mammalian cells,\nwe observed an inhibitory effect of ribavirin on ZIKV replication and\nZIKV-induced cell death without cytotoxic effect. Furthermore, we\nfound that STAT1-deficient mice, which lack type I IFN signaling, were\nhighly sensitive to ZIKV infection and exhibited lethal outcome.\nRibavirin abrogated viremia in ZIKV-infected STAT-1-deficient mice.\nThese data suggest that the inhibition of viral RNA-dependent RNA\npolymerases may be effective for treatment of ZIKV infection. Our data\nprovide a new insight into the mechanisms for inhibition of ZIKV\nreplication and prevention of Zika fever. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) It will be interesting to see if these encouraging results showing\ninhibition of Zika virus replication can be replicated in non-human\nprimates. The challenge for use of drugs to inhibit Zika virus\ninfection in humans is that most (around 80 percent) Zika virus\ninfections are asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms. These\nindividuals will probably not seek medical treatment, even though\ntheir fetuses are at risk of infection with teratogenic effects. -\nMod.TY \n<br><br><strong>{3}</strong> Zika virus skewed immunosuppression.\nDate: Mon 21 Aug 2017.\nSource: Nature Microbiology journal (edited)\n(http://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-017-0016-3) \nref: Foo SS, Chen W, Chan Y, et al. Asian Zika virus strains target\nCD14+ blood monocytes and induce M2-skewed immunosuppression during\npregnancy. Nat Microbiol. 2017. doi: 10.1038/s41564-017-0016-3\n-\nAbstract\nBlood CD14+ monocytes are frontline immunomodulators categorized into\nclassical, intermediate or non-classical subsets, and subsequently\ndifferentiated into M1 pro- or M2 anti-inflammatory macrophages on\nstimulation. Although the Zika virus (ZIKV) rapidly establishes\nviraemia, the target cells and immune responses, particularly during\npregnancy, remain elusive. Furthermore, it is unknown whether African-\nand Asian-lineage ZIKV have different phenotypic impacts on host\nimmune responses. Using human blood infection, we identified CD14+\nmonocytes as the primary target for African- or Asian-lineage ZIKV\ninfection. When immunoprofiles of human blood infected with ZIKV were\ncompared, a classical/intermediate monocyte-mediated M1-skewed\ninflammation by the African-lineage ZIKV infection was observed, in\ncontrast to a non-classical monocyte-mediated M2-skewed\nimmunosuppression by the Asian-lineage ZIKV infection. Importantly,\ninfection of the blood of pregnant women revealed an enhanced\nsusceptibility to ZIKV infection. Specifically, Asian-lineage ZIKV\ninfection of pregnant women's blood led to an exacerbated M2-skewed\nimmunosuppression of non-classical monocytes in conjunction with a\nglobal suppression of type I interferon-signaling pathway and an\naberrant expression of host genes associated with pregnancy\ncomplications. Also, 30 ZIKV+ sera from symptomatic pregnant patients\nshowed elevated levels of M2-skewed immunosuppressive cytokines and\npregnancy-complication-associated fibronectin-1. This study\ndemonstrates the differential immunomodulatory responses of blood\nmonocytes, particularly during pregnancy, on infection with different\nlineages of ZIKV. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{4}</strong> Virus alters mosquito genes.\nDate: Tue 22 Aug 2017.\nSource: bioRxiv journal (edited)\n(http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/22/179416) \nref: Etebari K, Hegde S, Saldana MA, et al. Global transcriptome\nanalysis of _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes in response to Zika virus\ninfection. bioRxiv 179416; doi:10.1101/179416\n-\nZika virus (ZIKV) of the Flaviviridae family is a recently emerged\nmosquito-borne virus that has been implicated in the surge of the\nnumber of microcephaly instances in South America. The recent rapid\nspread of the virus led to its declaration as a global health\nemergency by the World Health Organization. The virus is transmitted\nmainly by the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_ that also vectors dengue virus,\nhowever little is known about the interactions of the virus with the\nmosquito vector. In this study, we investigated the transcriptome\nprofiles of whole _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes in response to ZIKV\ninfection at 2, 7, and 14 days post-infection using RNA-Seq. Results\nshowed changes in the abundance of a large number of transcripts at\neach time point following infection, with 18 transcripts commonly\nchanged among the 3 time points. Gene ontology analysis revealed that\nmost of the altered genes are involved in metabolic process, cellular\nprocess and proteolysis. In addition, 486 long intergenic non-coding\nRNAs were identified altered upon ZIKV infection. Further, we found\ncorrelational changes of a number of potential mRNA target genes with\nthat of altered host microRNAs. The outcomes provide a basic\nunderstanding of _Ae. aegypti_ responses to ZIKV and helps to\ndetermine host factors involved in replication or mosquito host\nanti-viral response against the virus. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) Mosquito vector competence depends on the relationship of virus and\nthe mosquito, and the defenses that the mosquito can mobilize against\nthe virus infection. Studies, such as the one above, can document the\nchanges that occur when the virus infects the mosquito, and if\ndifferences in relative vector efficiency of different geographic\nstrains of this mosquito might be related to alternations in mosquito\ngenes when infected. It would be interesting to know if these gene\nchanges affect fitness, and especially longevity of infected\nmosquitoes. - Mod.TY \n<br><br><strong>{5}</strong> Virus effects on sperm, body fluids.\nDate: Mon 21 Aug 2017.\nSource: The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal (edited)\n(http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(17)30444-9/abstract) \nref: Joguet G, Mansuy JM, Matusali G, et al.

To investigate the effects of Zika\nvirus infection on semen and clearance of Zika virus from semen and\nbody fluids, we aimed to study a cohort of Zika virus-infected men. Methods\nThis prospective observational study recruited men presenting with\nacute Zika virus infection at Pointe-Ã -Pitre University Hospital in\nGuadeloupe, French Caribbean, where a Zika virus outbreak occurred\nbetween April and November, 2016. Blood, urine, and semen were\ncollected at days 7, 11, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 after symptom onset,\nand semen characteristics, such as total sperm count, sperm motility,\nvitality, and morphology, and reproductive hormone concentrations,\nsuch as testosterone, inhibin, follicle-stimulating hormone, and\nluteinising hormone, were assessed. At days 7, 11, and 20, semen was\nprocessed to isolate motile spermatozoa. Zika virus RNA was detected\nby RT-PCR using whole blood, serum, urine, seminal plasma, semen\ncells, and motile spermatozoa fractions. Zika virus was isolated from\ndifferent sperm fractions on Vero E6 cultures. Findings\n15 male volunteers (mean age 35 years SD 5; range 25-44) with acute\nZika virus infection and positive Zika virus RNA detection in blood or\nurine were enrolled. Total sperm count was decreased from median\n119âÃâ10^6 spermatozoa (IQR interquartile range 22-234)\nat day 7, to 45.2âÃâ10^6 (16.5-89.6) at day 30, and 70\nÃ 10^6 (28.5-81.4) at day 60, respectively, after Zika virus\ninfection. Inhibin values increased from 93.5 pg/mL (IQR 55-162) at\nday 7 to 150 pg/mL (78-209) at day 120 when total sperm count\nrecovered. In motile spermatozoa obtained after density gradient\nseparation, Zika virus RNA was found in 3 of 14 patients at day 7, 4\nof 15 at day 11, and 4 of 15 at day 20, and replication-competent\nvirus was found in the tested patient. Seminal shedding kinetics\nseemed heterogeneous among patients. Whole blood was the fluid most\nfrequently positive for Zika virus RNA (62 of 92 samples) and 3\npatients remained positive at day 120. Interpretation\nSemen alterations early after acute Zika virus infection might affect\nfertility and could be explained by virus effects on the testis and\nepididymis. Frequency of shedding and high viral load in semen,\ntogether with the presence of replicative virus in a motile\nspermatozoa fraction, can lead to Zika virus transmission during\nsexual contact and assisted reproduction procedures. Whole blood seems\nto be the best specimen for Zika virus RNA detection, diagnosis, and\nfollow-up. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall In a new study that included 12 men in French Guiana who had Zika\nvirus, 4 never had any detectable Zika in their semen, 1 excreted Zika\nvirus in his semen for at least 3 days, and 7 had Zika virus in semen\nfor at least 1 month. The maximum duration of detectable Zika in semen\nin the study was 45 days ((http://tinyurl.com/y9nhtgtk)).

Vaccines protect fetus from Zika. JAMA. 2017; 318(8):\n689. doi:10.1001/jama.2017.11200\n-\nResearchers funded in part by the National Institutes of Health have\nrecently demonstrated that 2 experimental vaccines can restrict\ntransmission of Zika virus from pregnant mice to their fetuses,\nthereby shielding offspring from congenital damage or death. Multiple candidate Zika vaccines have been shown protective against\ninfection with the virus in animal studies, with several now in human\ntrials, but none were tested in the context of pregnancy, according to\nthe authors of the study published in Cell\n(http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(17)30759-6). The 2\nvaccine candidates investigated in the new study are the 1st to\ndemonstrate efficacy in preventing vertical transmission of the virus\nand related fetal death in an animal model. Although the vaccines were\nadministered to female mice prior to pregnancy, the result is\nconsidered an important step toward developing a vaccine that could be\nsafely given to pregnant women. One of the 2 candidates is a modified messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine\nencoding Zika genes, developed by the biotechnology company Moderna.\nIt is already in safety trials in women who are not pregnant. The\nother is a live-attenuated Zika strain developed by researchers at the\nUniversity of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). The testing was carried out by scientists from the National Institute\nof Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Washington University School of\nMedicine, and UTMB. The researchers 1st vaccinated the mice with 1 of\nthe vaccines or a placebo. After mating, the animals were challenged\nwith the virus 6 days into pregnancy. A week later, more than 50\npercent of placentas and fetuses from mice administered the mRNA\nvaccine had virtually no Zika RNA. The remainder had \"substantially\nlower\" levels relative to placebo.\nThe live vaccine provided broader protection: 78 percent of placentas\nand 83 percent of fetuses had Zika RNA at or below the level of\ndetection, while the placebo group exhibited significantly higher\nlevels of placental and fetal Zika RNA. Mice vaccinated with either\nvaccine had significantly higher rates of fetal viability; whereas 100\npercent of fetuses from mice vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine were\nborn, none survived to term in the placebo group. A working group funded by the Wellcome Trust recently approved ethical\nguidelines for testing such vaccines in pregnant women, normally\nexcluded from drug trials. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) It is reassuring to learn that at least 2 vaccines are now entering\nclinical trials in women. Although anti-Zika virus drugs are under\ndevelopment, preventing infection through vaccination seems to be the\nmost effective measure to prevent fetal infection and adverse effects\nof the virus infection in adults. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"297":{"title":"Dengue/DHF update (11): Americas","date":["28","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Dengue/DHF update (11): Americas","summary":"\nDENGUE/DHF UPDATE (11): AMERICAS\n\nA ProMED-mail post\n(http://www.promedmail.org)\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n(http://www.isid.org) In this update:\nCases in various countries:\nAmericas regional\n\nCases in various countries not mentioned above or more recent case\nnumbers.

(promed@promedmail.org)  As reported in EUFMD's most recent Global FMD situation report (July 2017), the WRLFMD at Pirbright has sequenced a field isolate received there from Mongolia (O/MOG/10/2017), genotyped as 'O/ME-SA/PanAsia'. The Mongolian virus was subjected to vaccine matching strain differentiation (VMSD) test, with the following results: \"good matching results with O/TUR/5/2009 but not with O 3039 and Manisa\". It will be interesting to note if the vaccine applied in Mongolia has been selected according to the said VMSD test results. The genotyping results above are not yet available on the WRLFMD website.  An OIE interactive map showing the locations of the 20 FMDV-O outbreaks reported from Mongolia since the start of the event (20 Jan 2017) is available at (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=22811).  According to Mongolia's National Broadcast, dated 30 Aug 2017 (machine-translated from (https://www.mnb.mn/i/121355)), FMD is also circulating in the eastern province (aimag) of Sukhbaatar, as well as the central province of Tuv (Tov), and in 2 districts (soums) (Songino Khairkhan and Khan-Uul) of the Mongolian capital of Ulaanbaatar. This presents a spread of the virus westwards, not yet reported to the OIE (map at (http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/asia/political-map-of-Mongolia.gif)).  The media report also includes the following data on vaccination: \"The vaccination program was implemented from 11 Aug 2017 in 934 427 livestock . Currently, vaccinations of 750 363 heads of livestock in 6 districts are being implemented, of which 83.7 percent have already been completed.\" It is not clear if the said vaccinations cover also the recently infected central regions. - Mod.AS  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1).

In an earlier study done in New Delhi, such multiple\ndengue serotype infections were reported in only 19 per cent of cases.\nAll 4 dengue serotypes were detected in almost equal number in blood\nsamples, unlike in an earlier study conducted in New Delhi wherein one\nserotype was found to be dominating. This has been indicated as a\npossible reason for the high prevalence of infection due to more than\none dengue serotype. Another finding of concern is that DEN-4 strain,\nresembling the one detected in Pune in 2009, was detected in as many\nas 11 samples. DEN-4 is associated with unusual symptoms like\nrespiratory distress, pleural effusion, and elevated levels of liver\nenzymes.

This came about after 2\nkidney recipients in Taiwan were diagnosed with dengue 2 days after\nreceiving a kidney each from the same donor, said National Cheng Kung\nUniversity microbiology and immunology professor Dr Oscar Perng\nGuey-chuen. \"This indicates a potential risk,\" the Taiwan-based\nscientist said, adding that no dengue virus was detected in the\ndonor's blood. He said the donor contracted dengue in 2015 and in mid-2016, he died\nin an accident. His family donated his corneas, liver, heart, and\nkidneys. Both patients had the same strain of the dengue virus the\ndonor had in 2015 and one of the recipients died of dengue\nhaemorrhagic fever, he said. Asked where the virus could be hiding since it could not be detected\nin the blood, he said it was a question scientists are trying to\nanswer. Interestingly, those who received the donor's corneas, liver,\nand heart did not develop dengue, Dr Perng said on the sidelines of\nthe National Dengue And Arboviruses Infection Conference 2017\nyesterday 12 Aug 2017. He said although there was not enough\nevidence to show the virus came from the donor as the kidneys were not\ntested for dengue before the transplant, the same virus was found in\nthe patients' bodies after that. Dr Perng said his team had studied mice for dengue virus in the blood\ntestes, kidney, liver, spleen and brain, and found the virus present\nin the kidneys and brain. \"We believe the virus probably resided in\nthe kidneys and was not cleared by the body,\" he said, adding that the\nvirus could have been activated after transplant. He said this raised\nconcerns about asymptomatic people who are dengue carriers. Health Ministry deputy director, general Datuk Dr S Jeyaindran said\npatients with severe dengue would have better recovery if they were\ngiven colloids, a more concentrated fluid, at the early stage in fluid\nmanagement for dengue patients. Dr Jeyaindran, who was representing\nHealth Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam, said colloids may be\nintroduced at an earlier stage, instead of saline because it has not\nbeen successful in treating patients with severe dengue. He said more\nstudies will be conducted to find out at which stage the colloids\nshould be given. byline: Loh Foon Fong \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) - Air travel related spread of dengue.\nDate: Thu 3 Aug 2017.\nSource: Medical Xpress (edited)\n(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-08-air-responsible-dengue-asia.html) \nWhile the incidences of many other infectious diseases have declined\nover the past decade, the number of cases and outbreaks of dengue\nvirus have continued to increase. The spread of dengue to new areas is\nlikely due in large part to trends in air travel, researchers now\nreport in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Dengue virus affects as estimated 390 million people around the globe\neach year, and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild fever and\nheadache to severe low blood pressure. The virus has mostly caused\ndisease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, but a 2014\noutbreak in Japan broke that pattern. Overall, the geographic area\naffected by dengue has been growing in recent years. In the new work, Huaiyu Tian and Bing Xu, both of Beijing Normal\nUniversity, China, together with colleagues from the University of\nOxford and elsewhere analyzed the spread of dengue viruses in Asia\nfrom 1956 to 2015. They used 2202 genetic sequences of dengue viruses,\ncollected in 20 countries or regions of Asia over the 59 years, to\ndetermine how different strains were related. They also investigated\ntrends in air travel, maritime mobility, migration, and\nsocio-economics to determine what factors impact the spread of\ndengue. The spread of 3 different dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1, -2, and -3,\nis associated with air traffic more so than any other factors, the\ndata revealed. Air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India, the\nresearchers found, help seed dengue epidemics, while China, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, and Singapore help diffuse the virus to other Asian\ncountries. \"Future trends in global mobility could potentially accelerate the\nappearance and diffusion of DENV worldwide,\" the researchers say.\n\"Prevention and control of dengue epidemics requires a better\nunderstanding of its mode of geographic dissemination, especially for\ncountries in the tropics.\" Reference: Tian H, Sun Z, Faria NR, et al.

From: Sher Bahadur Pun (drsherbdr@yahoo.com) (edited)   During a 2-week period (15 through 29 Aug 2017), at least 86 scrub typhus (ST) cases (including 9 children) have been identified by laboratory testing at Sukraraj Tropical & Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH). Majority of these patients are being treated in different hospitals in Kathmandu. 9 children with laboratory confirmed ST received treatment at STIDH and recovered uneventfully.  It is quite surprising for me observing such a large number of ST cases being detected in Kathmandu, the biggest and most densely populated area of Nepal. Because ST has previously been almost exclusively detected in rural areas of Nepal. What is not yet clear is the impact of ST between the years 2004 and 2015. ST was first well documented in 2004 in Kathmandu (1), while the significant number of ST cases has only been detected since 2015.  The widespread use of antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin, could be one possible explanation. In other words, healthcare workers in Nepal usually view any fever as typhoid fever, thus used to treat febrile patients with ciprofloxacin, which might have also worked simultaneously against ST too. However, nowadays, cefixime has become the drug of choice for typhoid fever, and it may, however, not work effectively against ST, resulting in emergence of ST in Nepal.  Reference  1.

Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, MD, PhD Clinical Research Unit Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital Kathmandu Nepal (drsherbdr@yahoo.com)  ProMED-mail thanks Dr Sher Bahadur Pun for his continued contributions on scrub typhus in Nepal.  Doxycycline is the drug of choice and it is preferred over other tetracyclines for treatment of scrub typhus; it is rarely associated with staining of teeth in children younger than 8 years (1). Macrolides, such as azithromycin, are also reported to be efficacious (2). Fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, have been reported to be clinically effective in the treatment of scrub typhus in a few patients. However, some clinical studies suggest that fluoroquinolones are not as effective in patients with scrub typhus as other antibiotics (3,4).  In vitro testing of some strains of _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, the cause of scrub typhus, has been reported to show resistance to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin (minimum inhibitory concentration=8 micrograms/mL) (5) and mutation in the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) of the gyrA gene associated with fluoroquinolone resistance has been found (3,5).  These findings suggest that fluoroquinolones are likely not appropriate for the treatment of scrub typhus.  References - 1. Panpanich R, Garner P. Antibiotics for treating scrub typhus.

Date: Thu 31 Aug 2017. From: Michael J. Bangs (mbangs@fmi.com) (edited)   It stands to reason that the presence of _Anopheles farauti_ as the new entrant into New Caledonia is presumably recent. The nearest neighbor is Vanuatu, a malaria-endemic country that has but one anopheline species present in that island group, _Anopheles farauti_ sensu stricto, an effective malaria vector provided you add _Plasmodium_ to the mix.  _Anopheles farauti_ is one member of 8 known sibling species in the _Farauti_ Complex (closely related species that are morphologically identical, thus confounding accurate identification without the use of molecular techniques). It is by far the most widely distributed species in the complex in the southwest Pacific region (Maluku island group, eastern Indonesia to northern Australia, PNG, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu). The species' ability to inhabit brackish water environments (predominantly a coastal inhabitant) has aided in its dispersal throughout the region.  The origin of the anopheline population in New Caledonia might remain a mystery, but this discovery is of concern. If the area of establishment is relatively confined, it might be possible to eliminate this species before it extends further into the country. Foremost, identify the species.   Michael J. Bangs, MSPH, PhD. Public Health & Malaria Control International SOS Kuala Kencana, Papua, Indonesia (mbangs@fmi.com)  ProMED thanks Dr. Bangs for his comments.  The _Anopheles_ reported in the previous posting was found in an area of La Tontouta, north of Noumea. One hopes that the area of discovery is small enough to permit control.

Source: The Business Times (edited) (http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/consumer/3-more-nz-farms-test-positive-for-cattle-disease)   A serious bacterial cattle disease has been identified at 3 more farms in New Zealand, raising the number of affected farms to 6, the country's Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) said on Tue 29 Aug 2017.  Two of the farms that reported positive results for the _Mycoplasma bovis_ disease belong to the Van Leeuwen Dairy Group, which also owns the 1st 2 farms to report the bacteria in July 2017.  The owner of the 3rd unnamed farm in the country's South Island had received a small number of calves from another infected farm, the ministry said in an emailed statement. \"We fully expect to find more infected properties as we continue our tracing and testing programme,\" MPI Response Coordinator David Yard said, adding that there was no evidence the disease was spreading without close contact to infected animals.  _Mycoplasma bovis_ is common in many countries and can lead to conditions such as udder infection, pneumonia, and arthritis in affected cattle, but does not pose a food safety risk or any risk to humans.  News of the outbreak in July 2017 briefly knocked the New Zealand currency given the importance of the cattle industry to the economy, with dairy the country's largest export good.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  We know the MPI is investigating how this pathogen got into the country. This particular pathogen causes a variety of clinical signs from respiratory, to arthritis, and mastitis and can be difficult to diagnose. It can be an aggressive pathogen, therefore it is not unexpected that MPI has found, and expects to find more cases of this disease. - Mod.TG  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/164).

The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 11 Jun 2017, from Killa Abdullah, Balochistan. - Two new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) environmental positive samples were reported in the past week, from Karachi, Sindh (collected on 7 and 12 Aug 2017). - Additionally, pre-notification was received this week of a new WPV1 case from Karachi, Pakistan. The case will be officially reflected in next week's global data reporting. Karachi had previously been a key reservoir for WPV1 in Pakistan. Analysis is ongoing to determine the origin of this latest case and a response is being planned. The case had onset of paralysis on 11 Aug 2017. The last previous case from Karachi is from January 2016. - The National Task Force for Polio Eradication convened last week, chaired by the Prime Minister of Pakistan and attended by the senior leadership from the national and provincial levels. The Task force reviewed the revised National Emergency Action Plan 2017/18 and discussed mechanisms of accelerating the implementation of strategies to stop WPV1 transmission in the key hot spots. - Under the National Emergency Action Plan for polio eradication, the country is planning to implement 2 nation-wide and 2 sub-national vaccination rounds from September to December 2017.  Nigeria - - No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 21 Aug 2016 in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno. - Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and cVDPV2 strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016). - Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance.  Lake Chad Basin  - The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno, Nigeria in 2016) and cVDPV2 (Borno and Sokoto provinces in Nigeria in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak. - Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.  Central Africa  - One new case of cVDPV2 was reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), from Haut Lomami province, with onset of paralysis on 20 Jun 2017. The total number of cVDPV2 cases this year 2017 is now 8, in 2 separate outbreaks: in Haut Lomami province (6 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on 20 Jun 2017); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on 26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017, with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May 2017). - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time. Outbreak response is taking place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols, targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 across the 2 provinces. \n- The 1st mOPV2 round was implemented on 27-29 Jun 2017 in the 2 affected provinces; and the 2nd mOPV2 round ran from 13-15 Jul 2017 in Haut Lomami and 20-22 Jul 2017 in Maniema. - Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.  Middle East  - In Syria, 6 new cases of cVDPV2 were officially reported in the past week from Deir-Ez-Zour governorate, bringing the total number of cases in this outbreak to 39. Onset of paralysis of these cases is between 3 Mar 2017 and 10 Jul 2017. The bulk of all cases are from Deir-Ez-Zour, the epicentre of this outbreak. - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized and implemented, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Two vaccination campaigns are planned for both Deir-Ez-Zour and Raqqa governorates. - The 1st mOPV2 round in Deir-Ez-Zour was successfully carried out between 22-26 Jul 2017. Independent post-campaign monitoring reflected coverage of 88.4 percent (based on caregiver recall). - The 2nd immunization round for Deir-Ez-Zor governorate started on 22 Aug 2017 and is ongoing. Monovalent OPV2 is being provided for children between 0-59 months of age, and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) for children 2-23 months. In addition to polio vaccines, Aqua Tabs are being provided to families for water purification - 2.5 tons of water purification tablets for 400 000 people have been disseminated at health centers. - Plans are being finalized to mitigate the risks of further spread from the outbreak zone to neighbouring areas and countries, including immunization of at-risk populations in northwest Syria, Turkey and Lebanon.

(promed@promedmail.org)  In the above global summary, there is still identified transmission ongoing in Pakistan as seen by the positive environmental sample in Karachi as well as the early report on a case of WPV1 associated disease in Karachi. It will be interesting to learn of the genetic profile of the environmental isolates in Karachi (from this past week as well as from a few weeks ago) and compare them with the newly identified WPV1 associated case in Karachi to see if they are genetically related.  There has been more activity associated with cVDPV2 in both Syria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), with 6 newly confirmed cases in Syria and 1 newly confirmed case in the DR Congo. According to the Situation Report in section <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> above, there are still 5 additional PV2 (poliovirus type 2) isolates in Syria undergoing final testing  4 from Deir al Zour and 1 from Raqqa. Hence there will probably be more cases confirmed in the coming days or weeks. I have not been able to identify similar report information from the DR Congo outbreak so it is not clear if the transmission has been interrupted leaving a total of 8 cases, or if there are still probable cases pending confirmation.

The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) together with the World Health Organisation and supporting partners, hosted the Lassa fever outbreak after action review meeting on the 21 and 22 Aug 2017. Participants were drawn from the states affected by the outbreak this year 2017, Lassa fever treatment facilities, diagnostic laboratories, NCDC surveillance, laboratory, and health emergency response teams, Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Federal Ministry of Environment, and other key stakeholders. Technical support was provided by WHO Africa Regional Office (AFRO) and the National Lassa fever Steering Committee.  The event was declared open on the 1st day by the Honourable Minister of State for Heath, Dr Osagie Enahire, who applauded the NCDC for its efforts towards stemming the tides of Lassa fever in Nigeria and charged all present to find a lasting solution to the menace of the disease in the country. The chairperson of the National Steering Committee, Prof Oyewale Tomori gave an overview of Lassa fever outbreak since the virus was discovered in 1969 with a critical review of control efforts taken in the past which have not yielded needed results. He decried the unsustainable efforts that have plagued the surveillance system in Nigeria and called on every stakeholder to realign their activities to achieve a common goal of a strengthened surveillance system, which can be used as a strong tool in the fight against Lassa fever. He urged participants present to focus on finding practical solutions towards elimination of the disease.  A national report of the 2016/2017 Lassa fever outbreak was presented. As at epi-week 33 (14-20 Aug 2017), a total of 764 suspected cases have been reported across 19 states (Ogun, Taraba, Rivers, Nasarawa, Edo, Ondo, Bauchi, Ebonyi, Plateau, Kaduna, Gombe, Cross-River, Borno, Kano, Kogi, Enugu, Anambra, Lagos, and Kwara). 247 of these cases were confirmed and 14 classified as probable cases. A total of 83 deaths have been recorded, with 69 of them in confirmed cases. Case fatality rate is 33.6 percent in confirmed and probable cases and 15.1 percent in all cases (confirmed, probable, and suspected). The response activities carried out by the NCDC, including the development of Viral Haemorrhagic Fever VHF guidelines, deployment of rapid response teams, provision of ribavirin and other medical supplies to states and several others, were also discussed.  Robust discussions were held by the participants following various presentations made, which all focused on preparedness and response to Lassa fever outbreak. The 2-day meeting provided an opportunity to reflect on the events which led to the 2016/2017 Lassa fever outbreak in each state and also to conduct out a detailed review of the response activities carried out by the affected States and the NCDC. In addition, gaps in preparedness, response and surveillance activities were highlighted and pragmatic steps to be taken to bridge these gaps were proposed.  Working groups were created in line with the 6 thematic areas under the incident management system (IMS) for Lassa fever  coordination/case management/infection prevention and control, laboratory, logistics, surveillance/data management and risk communication. Focus group discussions were held within these working groups during which best practises and challenges in the 2016/2017 Lassa fever outbreak were highlighted. Practical recommendations were made by every group in their individual thematic areas and in cross-cutting areas. Each state was enjoined to follow up with these recommendations, as it applies to their particular needs and circumstances and to also incorporate them in their state-specific Lassa fever preparedness work plan.  The NCDC affirmed its resolve to continue to ensure that the disease burden caused by Lassa fever, and indeed all epidemic-prone diseases in Nigeria is reduced. The steps taken at this meeting will serve as added incentives towards establishing a finish line for the scourge of Lassa fever. All stakeholders and the general public are called upon to work with the governments in the various States towards a collaborative plan for the control and elimination of Lassa fever.   1.

Once again, ProMED-mail thanks Dr Olutayo Olajide Babalobi for sending in the epidemiological report above.  As noted in earlier comments, Lassa fever remains a problem in Nigeria because the virus is endemic there. Virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or their excreta. Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients.  Images of mastomys mice, the rodent reservoir of Lass fever virus, can be seen at (http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877).

On Sun 3 Sep 2017, some 59 officers were hospitalised in various\nhospitals in Nairobi with another 36 admitted Mon 4 Sep 2017, after\ncontracting the disease. They were part of a group of 430 officers\ndeployed to Nairobi ahead of the Supreme Court ruling on presidential\npoll petition on Fri 1 Sep 2017. They were residing at the\nMultimedia University Hotel in Rongai, about 17 kilometers 10.6 mi\nsouth of the capital. \"Those infected did not get the disease from the Multimedia University\nsince they had their lunch away from the institution.

The Health Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu said the officers were in\nstable condition. Dr Mailu said investigations were underway to\nestablish whether the canteen had outsourced services to cater for the\nlarge number of officers. He said the ministry was concerned that\ninstead of eliminating cholera, new cases were emerging. Nairobi was first hit by the outbreak on 19 May 2017, with 56 cases\nhaving been reported. One of the police officers who requested anonymity said they ate ugali\n(a Kenyan staple made of maize flour) and meat stew at the canteen on\nSat 2 Sep 2017.

Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:\n- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit.

This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis.

Authorities are not ruling out the possibility that the 8 individuals contracted hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), widely known as \"hamburger disease,\" a bacterial infection that can leave the renal system severely damaged. Many cases are caused by _E. coli_, which can be found in undercooked meat like hamburgers. Children under the age of 5 are particularly vulnerable. On 25 Aug 2017, a group of 15 adults and elementary school students from the same church in Jeonju visited McDonald's Jeonju branch and ate bulgogi burgers together. A day later, 7 children and 1 adult experienced diarrhea and vomiting. The authorities declared an epidemiological probe into the case on Sat 2 Sep 2017.  As the case was publicized, McDonald's Korea halted selling bulgogi burgers nationwide starting on Sat 2 Sep 2017. On its website, a notice says, \"We have decided to stop selling bulgogi burgers pending the outcome of the ongoing investigation by authorities,\" adding that the multinational company's Korean branch was taking the issue seriously. It also said the company will do its best to help patients recover, though without elaborating on how or when.  The outcome of the ongoing probe is expected to be made public around Wed 6 Sep 2017.  The case in Jeonju is not the only incident that the corporation, which has 440 branches in Korea alone, has recently found itself in. In July 2017, the mother of a 5-year-old girl filed a complaint claiming irreparable harm was done to her child because of the fast food chain's mismanagement of its food products. The mother, claimed her daughter contracted HUS after eating a Happy Meal in September 2016, and she now must undergo peritoneal dialysis on a daily basis.

Byline: Kang Jin-kyu   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Whether this cluster of illnesses is caused by enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ is unknown as yet and ProMED would appreciate more information about the illnesses. A one day incubation period is short for EHEC but the outbreak is occurring in the wake of several cases of EHEC linked to the chain in South Korea.  Classic bulgogi recipes use a marinade of soy, ginger, garlic, and gochujang (Korean chili paste) to flavor and tenderize strips of meat. Because combining a marinade into ground beef would change the consistency of the hamburger, making it more of a \"sloppy-joe\", usually a bulgogi inspired sauce is used on top of the burger although a Korean inspired spice combination can be added to the ground beef.

This came about after 2\nkidney recipients in Taiwan were diagnosed with dengue 2 days after\nreceiving a kidney each from the same donor, said National Cheng Kung\nUniversity microbiology and immunology professor Dr Oscar Perng\nGuey-chuen. \"This indicates a potential risk,\" the Taiwan-based\nscientist said, adding that no dengue virus was detected in the\ndonor's blood. He said the donor contracted dengue in 2015 and in mid-2016, he died\nin an accident. His family donated his corneas, liver, heart, and\nkidneys. Both patients had the same strain of the dengue virus the\ndonor had in 2015 and one of the recipients died of dengue\nhaemorrhagic fever, he said. Asked where the virus could be hiding since it could not be detected\nin the blood, he said it was a question scientists are trying to\nanswer. Interestingly, those who received the donor's corneas, liver,\nand heart did not develop dengue, Dr Perng said on the sidelines of\nthe National Dengue And Arboviruses Infection Conference 2017\nyesterday 12 Aug 2017. He said although there was not enough\nevidence to show the virus came from the donor as the kidneys were not\ntested for dengue before the transplant, the same virus was found in\nthe patients' bodies after that. Dr Perng said his team had studied mice for dengue virus in the blood\ntestes, kidney, liver, spleen and brain, and found the virus present\nin the kidneys and brain. \"We believe the virus probably resided in\nthe kidneys and was not cleared by the body,\" he said, adding that the\nvirus could have been activated after transplant. He said this raised\nconcerns about asymptomatic people who are dengue carriers. Health Ministry deputy director, general Datuk Dr S Jeyaindran said\npatients with severe dengue would have better recovery if they were\ngiven colloids, a more concentrated fluid, at the early stage in fluid\nmanagement for dengue patients. Dr Jeyaindran, who was representing\nHealth Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam, said colloids may be\nintroduced at an earlier stage, instead of saline because it has not\nbeen successful in treating patients with severe dengue. He said more\nstudies will be conducted to find out at which stage the colloids\nshould be given. byline: Loh Foon Fong \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) - Air travel related spread of dengue.\nDate: Thu 3 Aug 2017.\nSource: Medical Xpress (edited)\n(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-08-air-responsible-dengue-asia.html) \nWhile the incidences of many other infectious diseases have declined\nover the past decade, the number of cases and outbreaks of dengue\nvirus have continued to increase. The spread of dengue to new areas is\nlikely due in large part to trends in air travel, researchers now\nreport in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Dengue virus affects as estimated 390 million people around the globe\neach year, and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild fever and\nheadache to severe low blood pressure. The virus has mostly caused\ndisease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, but a 2014\noutbreak in Japan broke that pattern. Overall, the geographic area\naffected by dengue has been growing in recent years. In the new work, Huaiyu Tian and Bing Xu, both of Beijing Normal\nUniversity, China, together with colleagues from the University of\nOxford and elsewhere analyzed the spread of dengue viruses in Asia\nfrom 1956 to 2015. They used 2202 genetic sequences of dengue viruses,\ncollected in 20 countries or regions of Asia over the 59 years, to\ndetermine how different strains were related. They also investigated\ntrends in air travel, maritime mobility, migration, and\nsocio-economics to determine what factors impact the spread of\ndengue. The spread of 3 different dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1, -2, and -3,\nis associated with air traffic more so than any other factors, the\ndata revealed. Air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India, the\nresearchers found, help seed dengue epidemics, while China, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, and Singapore help diffuse the virus to other Asian\ncountries. \"Future trends in global mobility could potentially accelerate the\nappearance and diffusion of DENV worldwide,\" the researchers say.\n\"Prevention and control of dengue epidemics requires a better\nunderstanding of its mode of geographic dissemination, especially for\ncountries in the tropics.\" Reference: Tian H, Sun Z, Faria NR, et al.

All confirmed cases to date have had onset of paralysis before 14 Jul 2017. - Final lab results are pending for an additional 5 poliovirus type-2 (PV2) isolates (3 from Mayadeen and 1 from Boukamal districts, Deir Ez-Zor governorate, and 1 from Thawra district, Raqqa governorate). - The 2nd immunization round for Deir Ez-Zor started on 22 Aug 2017 and is ongoing due to high levels of population movement in and out of the governorate during the round. - WHO has organized the redistribution of vaccines and mapping of population movements to increase reach. An additional 90 000 mOPV2 doses are being transported from Damascus to Deir Ez-Zor, to cater for population influxes from As-Sukhnah, Homs governorate, and Al-Qa'im in Iraq. Corrective measures are expected to extend the round by 2 days. - Preparations for the 2nd immunization round for Raqqa are underway. - The total number of AFP cases detected in Deir Ez-Zor governorate since the beginning of 2017 is 122 (91 from Mayadeen, 10 from Deir Ez-Zor, and 21 from Boukamal districts). Raqqa governorate has reported 16 AFP cases (5 from Raqqa, 10 from Tell Abyad, and 1 from Thawra districts). Homs governorate has reported 28 AFP cases (12 from Homs city, 13 from Rastan, 1 from Tadmour and 2 from Talkalakh districts).  more details on the vaccination activities and future plans are available at the source URL as well as the epidemic curve and graphic representation of the vaccination status of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis cases by governorate and district. - Mod.MPP   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  In the above global summary, there is still identified transmission ongoing in Pakistan as seen by the positive environmental sample in Karachi as well as the early report on a case of WPV1 associated disease in Karachi. It will be interesting to learn of the genetic profile of the environmental isolates in Karachi (from this past week as well as from a few weeks ago) and compare them with the newly identified WPV1 associated case in Karachi to see if they are genetically related.  There has been more activity associated with cVDPV2 in both Syria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), with 6 newly confirmed cases in Syria and 1 newly confirmed case in the DR Congo. According to the Situation Report in section <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> above, there are still 5 additional PV2 (poliovirus type 2) isolates in Syria undergoing final testing  4 from Deir al Zour and 1 from Raqqa. Hence there will probably be more cases confirmed in the coming days or weeks. I have not been able to identify similar report information from the DR Congo outbreak so it is not clear if the transmission has been interrupted leaving a total of 8 cases, or if there are still probable cases pending confirmation.

NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in\npress): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons,\nvaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside\nof Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as\n60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection\nlengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:\n- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam;\n- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however,\nhave suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be\neffective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and\noutbreak situations (63, 64). \"References\n\n57.

This came about after 2\nkidney recipients in Taiwan were diagnosed with dengue 2 days after\nreceiving a kidney each from the same donor, said National Cheng Kung\nUniversity microbiology and immunology professor Dr Oscar Perng\nGuey-chuen. \"This indicates a potential risk,\" the Taiwan-based\nscientist said, adding that no dengue virus was detected in the\ndonor's blood. He said the donor contracted dengue in 2015 and in mid-2016, he died\nin an accident. His family donated his corneas, liver, heart, and\nkidneys. Both patients had the same strain of the dengue virus the\ndonor had in 2015 and one of the recipients died of dengue\nhaemorrhagic fever, he said. Asked where the virus could be hiding since it could not be detected\nin the blood, he said it was a question scientists are trying to\nanswer. Interestingly, those who received the donor's corneas, liver,\nand heart did not develop dengue, Dr Perng said on the sidelines of\nthe National Dengue And Arboviruses Infection Conference 2017\nyesterday 12 Aug 2017. He said although there was not enough\nevidence to show the virus came from the donor as the kidneys were not\ntested for dengue before the transplant, the same virus was found in\nthe patients' bodies after that. Dr Perng said his team had studied mice for dengue virus in the blood\ntestes, kidney, liver, spleen and brain, and found the virus present\nin the kidneys and brain. \"We believe the virus probably resided in\nthe kidneys and was not cleared by the body,\" he said, adding that the\nvirus could have been activated after transplant. He said this raised\nconcerns about asymptomatic people who are dengue carriers. Health Ministry deputy director, general Datuk Dr S Jeyaindran said\npatients with severe dengue would have better recovery if they were\ngiven colloids, a more concentrated fluid, at the early stage in fluid\nmanagement for dengue patients. Dr Jeyaindran, who was representing\nHealth Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam, said colloids may be\nintroduced at an earlier stage, instead of saline because it has not\nbeen successful in treating patients with severe dengue. He said more\nstudies will be conducted to find out at which stage the colloids\nshould be given. byline: Loh Foon Fong \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) - Air travel related spread of dengue.\nDate: Thu 3 Aug 2017.\nSource: Medical Xpress (edited)\n(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-08-air-responsible-dengue-asia.html) \nWhile the incidences of many other infectious diseases have declined\nover the past decade, the number of cases and outbreaks of dengue\nvirus have continued to increase. The spread of dengue to new areas is\nlikely due in large part to trends in air travel, researchers now\nreport in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Dengue virus affects as estimated 390 million people around the globe\neach year, and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild fever and\nheadache to severe low blood pressure. The virus has mostly caused\ndisease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, but a 2014\noutbreak in Japan broke that pattern. Overall, the geographic area\naffected by dengue has been growing in recent years. In the new work, Huaiyu Tian and Bing Xu, both of Beijing Normal\nUniversity, China, together with colleagues from the University of\nOxford and elsewhere analyzed the spread of dengue viruses in Asia\nfrom 1956 to 2015. They used 2202 genetic sequences of dengue viruses,\ncollected in 20 countries or regions of Asia over the 59 years, to\ndetermine how different strains were related. They also investigated\ntrends in air travel, maritime mobility, migration, and\nsocio-economics to determine what factors impact the spread of\ndengue. The spread of 3 different dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1, -2, and -3,\nis associated with air traffic more so than any other factors, the\ndata revealed. Air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India, the\nresearchers found, help seed dengue epidemics, while China, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, and Singapore help diffuse the virus to other Asian\ncountries. \"Future trends in global mobility could potentially accelerate the\nappearance and diffusion of DENV worldwide,\" the researchers say.\n\"Prevention and control of dengue epidemics requires a better\nunderstanding of its mode of geographic dissemination, especially for\ncountries in the tropics.\" Reference: Tian H, Sun Z, Faria NR, et al.

On Tue 29 Aug 2017, Dr Rene Bagamasbad, Laguna health officer, said the victims were a 9-year-old boy in Calauan town and a 6-year-old boy in San Pablo City. He said the children died around 2 weeks ago.  Calauan and San Pablo City, being adjacent to each other, were also placed under investigation by the health office.  Only the Calauan case has so far reached the Calabarzon office of the Department of Health, according to Dr Rio Magpantay, DOH regional director.  The regional office, however, had also started monitoring \"signs and symptoms\" of possible Japanese encephalitis incidence in other parts of Laguna.  Calabarzon stands for the provinces of Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, and Quezon.  The disease, which is transmitted by the _Culex_ mosquito, commonly causes abdominal pains, fever, and seizures. It may also cause a part of the brain to swell.  Vaccines are available. But there is no cure yet for the disease. Vaccines are currently not part of the government's immunization program.  Magpantay said there was no declaration of an outbreak. But the DOH regional office would strengthen the surveillance of communities and hospitals.  It usually takes some time to confirm a case of Japanese encephalitis because specimens, such as the patient's blood sample, would have to be collected and submitted for testing at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine in Muntinlupa in Metro Manila.

Leptospirosis is an infectious disease caused by the _Leptospira interrogans_ bacteria. The leptospira bacteria are transmitted through wounds when in contact with floodwaters, vegetation, and moist soil contaminated with the urine of infected animals, especially rats. Leptospirosis is characterized by fever, muscle pain, reddish-yellowish body discoloration, dark-colored urine, light stools, low urine output, and severe headache.

Leptospirosis is an infection transmitted to humans by exposure to soil or fresh water contaminated with the urine of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rodents) that are chronically infected with pathogenic _Leptospira_. The spirochete _Leptospira_ may survive in contaminated fresh water or moist soil for weeks to months. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.

However, it is summarized\nbelow: The Dansk Supermarket Group (DSG) recalled cold-packed smoked salmon,\nmanufactured in Poland, after _Listeria monocytogenes_ was identified\nin the product. The isolate from the product was almost identical by\nwhole genome sequencing to isolates from 3 of 4 patients, whose food\nhistory in 3 of the patients identified the smoked salmon as the\nlikely source. The smoked salmon product was recalled from about 600 stores in\nDenmark and a limited number in Metro Poland. Up to 3 of the 4 patients had become ill in the same week in August\n2017 and the 4th had become ill in May 2017. One of the 4 patients has\ndied. All 4 patients had severe underlying disease. DSG consists of chains (fotex, Bilka, Netto, and Salling) with more\nthan 1400 stores in Denmark, Germany, Poland and Sweden. Refrigerated smoked salmon is a recognized potential source for\nlisteriosis, similar to other cold cut meats and non-heat treated\ncured smoked meats, being a ready-to-eat product that does not require\nfurther cooking before eating. The news report said that more cases\nrelated to this outbreak were expected, despite the recall, as the\nincubation period for listeriosis is up to 3 weeks actually symptoms\ncan start up to as 70 days after exposure. - Mod.ML A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at:\n(http://healthmap.org/promed/p/113).

The total amount of dead wild boars discovered in the woods around\nZlín, in the far east of the Czech Republic, stood at 94 at the end\nof August 2017. In this month, 23 new infected carcasses were found,\nwhich is a downward trend from July 2017, when 68 reports were sent\nto the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). The 1st report of\nASF in Czech wild boars was on Wed 21 Jun 2017. Many neighbouring countries have alerted their local pig producers to\nbe very careful what to feed their pigs - and their inhabitants what\nto purchase and how to dispose of it. So did Slovakia, according to\nthe Slovak Spectator. Zlín is only a few km away from the western\nSlovak border, to its north is Poland where ASF has been around since\n2014 and on its eastern border is Ukraine, where ASF has been\nconfirmed since 2011. In a presentation, given in mid-July 2017 to the European\nCommission's Standing Committee On Animals, Plants, Food and Feed\n(SCoPAFF), Dr Petr Šatrán of the Czech State Veterinary\nAdministration indicated that human activities are most likely the\ncause of the spread of the virus, seeing that the nearest reported\ncases of ASF were roughly 500 km 310.68 mi away and that the\npositive dead wild boars were found in inhabited areas. In the other country where ASF was found for the 1st time in 2017,\nRomania, things appear relatively quiet. News broke early this month\nAugust 2017 that ASF was also found on 2 backyard farms in the north\nof the country. Ever since, the Romanian authorities did not report\nany further outbreaks of ASF to the OIE. Of all other countries in the European Union, especially Poland has\ncontinued to report outbreaks of African Swine Fever in smaller and\nmiddle-sized operations. In August alone, on 23 farm sites of various\nsizes, ASF was found to have infected at least one animal, after which\nthe entire herd would have to be culled. The biggest operation in this respect was a farm near Monki, Podlaskie\nprovince, where all remaining 431 pigs had to be culled after 11 had\ndied as a result of ASF, on Sat 19 Aug 2017. Noteworthy as well was\nthe ASF-related closure of 2 farms in Lack, Lubelskie province, in\nearly August. These farms had 136 and 141 pigs respectively see also\nitem 2.

This was said by Poland's Minister of Agriculture,\nKrzysztof Yurgel, Niezalezna reports. As reported, the length of the fence will be 729 km 452.98 mi,\ncosting Poland 130 million zloties (more than 36.2 million USD). The\nfinal decision on a fence will be made within the next 3 weeks. According to experts, ASF has developed in the territory of Poland\n\"thanks to\" the wild boars who entered from Belarus. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) The accumulated ASF OIE data from Poland as of Thu 31 Aug 2017, are\nas follows (start of event 22 May 2014):\nNumber of follow-up reports: 189\nTotal outbreaks: 550 (Submitted)\nSpecies/ Susceptible/ Cases/ Deaths/ Killed and disposed of/\nSlaughtered\nWild boar/ - / 620 / 620 / 0 / 0\nDomestic Swine/ 6303/ 402/ 188/ 6097/ 0 A map showing ASF cases reported globally to the OIE since 1 Jan 2017,\nas of Thu 31 Aug 2017, is available at (http://tinyurl.com/ybexasqm).\nClick on the European cluster, zoom in to each of the countries of\ninterest. EU disease control measures require designation of risk areas as Part\nI (wild boar at risk, but no cases found), Part II (wild boar testing\npositive but no spill over into domestic pigs), Part III (cases in\nwild boar and occasional spill over into domestic pigs) and Part IV\nwhich concerns the island of Sardinia only. Consignments of live pigs,\nlive wild boars, meat of either source and animal by-products of\neither source are only allowed under certain derogations. For a full\nexplanation, see European Commission Implementing Decision\n2014/708/EU. ASF, a viral disease against which no vaccine has become available so\nfar, is currently threatening central and western Europe, where dense\npopulations of wild boar are present. According to a recent update of DEFRA (UK) ASF situation assessment,\nthe continuing cases in the Czech Republic, the spread in Poland which\nappears to be due to several breakdowns in biosecurity and the new\noutbreaks in Romania are \"concerning\". This signifies a spread in\ngeographic distribution, a possible drop in biosecurity awareness and\ntherefore an increase in the weight of infection in East Europe. Despite the relatively low level of trade in live pigs, there could be\na substantial movement of people, vehicles and personal imports of\npork products, therefore the risk of ASF introduction to the UK has\nbeen raised from \"very low\" (that is, \"rare but could occur\") to\n\"low\". The Russian veterinary watchdog Rosselkhoznadzor believes ASF will\nkeep moving west via 2 main pathways. The southerly route, has already\nseen the virus spread from Ukraine to Moldova. Russian vets believe it\ncould penetrate central Romania, then move to the Balkans, including\nBulgaria and Serbia. On the northern route, now that ASF has been found in the Czech\nRepublic, Rosselkhoznadzor believes, if it gains a foothold, it is\nlikely to head further west, with Germany next in the firing line.

The recent outbreaks of ZIKV in Brazil and French\nPolynesia have been linked to a considerable increase in the incidence\nof fetal microcephaly and other diseases such as Guillain-Barre\nsyndrome. Because there is currently no specific therapy or vaccine,\nthe early exploitation of a method to prevent expansion of ZIKV is a\nhigh priority. To validate commonly used antiviral drugs, we evaluated\nthe effect of ribavirin, a drug used to treat hepatitis C with\ninterferon-beta (IFN-beta), on ZIKV replication. In mammalian cells,\nwe observed an inhibitory effect of ribavirin on ZIKV replication and\nZIKV-induced cell death without cytotoxic effect. Furthermore, we\nfound that STAT1-deficient mice, which lack type I IFN signaling, were\nhighly sensitive to ZIKV infection and exhibited lethal outcome.\nRibavirin abrogated viremia in ZIKV-infected STAT-1-deficient mice.\nThese data suggest that the inhibition of viral RNA-dependent RNA\npolymerases may be effective for treatment of ZIKV infection. Our data\nprovide a new insight into the mechanisms for inhibition of ZIKV\nreplication and prevention of Zika fever. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) It will be interesting to see if these encouraging results showing\ninhibition of Zika virus replication can be replicated in non-human\nprimates. The challenge for use of drugs to inhibit Zika virus\ninfection in humans is that most (around 80 percent) Zika virus\ninfections are asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms. These\nindividuals will probably not seek medical treatment, even though\ntheir fetuses are at risk of infection with teratogenic effects. -\nMod.TY \n<br><br><strong>{3}</strong> Zika virus skewed immunosuppression.\nDate: Mon 21 Aug 2017.\nSource: Nature Microbiology journal (edited)\n(http://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-017-0016-3) \nref: Foo SS, Chen W, Chan Y, et al. Asian Zika virus strains target\nCD14+ blood monocytes and induce M2-skewed immunosuppression during\npregnancy. Nat Microbiol. 2017. doi: 10.1038/s41564-017-0016-3\n-\nAbstract\nBlood CD14+ monocytes are frontline immunomodulators categorized into\nclassical, intermediate or non-classical subsets, and subsequently\ndifferentiated into M1 pro- or M2 anti-inflammatory macrophages on\nstimulation. Although the Zika virus (ZIKV) rapidly establishes\nviraemia, the target cells and immune responses, particularly during\npregnancy, remain elusive. Furthermore, it is unknown whether African-\nand Asian-lineage ZIKV have different phenotypic impacts on host\nimmune responses. Using human blood infection, we identified CD14+\nmonocytes as the primary target for African- or Asian-lineage ZIKV\ninfection. When immunoprofiles of human blood infected with ZIKV were\ncompared, a classical/intermediate monocyte-mediated M1-skewed\ninflammation by the African-lineage ZIKV infection was observed, in\ncontrast to a non-classical monocyte-mediated M2-skewed\nimmunosuppression by the Asian-lineage ZIKV infection. Importantly,\ninfection of the blood of pregnant women revealed an enhanced\nsusceptibility to ZIKV infection. Specifically, Asian-lineage ZIKV\ninfection of pregnant women's blood led to an exacerbated M2-skewed\nimmunosuppression of non-classical monocytes in conjunction with a\nglobal suppression of type I interferon-signaling pathway and an\naberrant expression of host genes associated with pregnancy\ncomplications. Also, 30 ZIKV+ sera from symptomatic pregnant patients\nshowed elevated levels of M2-skewed immunosuppressive cytokines and\npregnancy-complication-associated fibronectin-1. This study\ndemonstrates the differential immunomodulatory responses of blood\nmonocytes, particularly during pregnancy, on infection with different\nlineages of ZIKV. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{4}</strong> Virus alters mosquito genes.\nDate: Tue 22 Aug 2017.\nSource: bioRxiv journal (edited)\n(http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/22/179416) \nref: Etebari K, Hegde S, Saldana MA, et al. Global transcriptome\nanalysis of _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes in response to Zika virus\ninfection. bioRxiv 179416; doi:10.1101/179416\n-\nZika virus (ZIKV) of the Flaviviridae family is a recently emerged\nmosquito-borne virus that has been implicated in the surge of the\nnumber of microcephaly instances in South America. The recent rapid\nspread of the virus led to its declaration as a global health\nemergency by the World Health Organization. The virus is transmitted\nmainly by the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_ that also vectors dengue virus,\nhowever little is known about the interactions of the virus with the\nmosquito vector. In this study, we investigated the transcriptome\nprofiles of whole _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes in response to ZIKV\ninfection at 2, 7, and 14 days post-infection using RNA-Seq. Results\nshowed changes in the abundance of a large number of transcripts at\neach time point following infection, with 18 transcripts commonly\nchanged among the 3 time points. Gene ontology analysis revealed that\nmost of the altered genes are involved in metabolic process, cellular\nprocess and proteolysis. In addition, 486 long intergenic non-coding\nRNAs were identified altered upon ZIKV infection. Further, we found\ncorrelational changes of a number of potential mRNA target genes with\nthat of altered host microRNAs. The outcomes provide a basic\nunderstanding of _Ae. aegypti_ responses to ZIKV and helps to\ndetermine host factors involved in replication or mosquito host\nanti-viral response against the virus. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) Mosquito vector competence depends on the relationship of virus and\nthe mosquito, and the defenses that the mosquito can mobilize against\nthe virus infection. Studies, such as the one above, can document the\nchanges that occur when the virus infects the mosquito, and if\ndifferences in relative vector efficiency of different geographic\nstrains of this mosquito might be related to alternations in mosquito\ngenes when infected. It would be interesting to know if these gene\nchanges affect fitness, and especially longevity of infected\nmosquitoes. - Mod.TY \n<br><br><strong>{5}</strong> Virus effects on sperm, body fluids.\nDate: Mon 21 Aug 2017.\nSource: The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal (edited)\n(http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(17)30444-9/abstract) \nref: Joguet G, Mansuy JM, Matusali G, et al.

At days 7, 11, and 20, semen was\nprocessed to isolate motile spermatozoa. Zika virus RNA was detected\nby RT-PCR using whole blood, serum, urine, seminal plasma, semen\ncells, and motile spermatozoa fractions. Zika virus was isolated from\ndifferent sperm fractions on Vero E6 cultures. Findings\n15 male volunteers (mean age 35 years SD 5; range 25-44) with acute\nZika virus infection and positive Zika virus RNA detection in blood or\nurine were enrolled. Total sperm count was decreased from median\n119âÃâ10^6 spermatozoa (IQR interquartile range 22-234)\nat day 7, to 45.2âÃâ10^6 (16.5-89.6) at day 30, and 70\nÃ 10^6 (28.5-81.4) at day 60, respectively, after Zika virus\ninfection. Inhibin values increased from 93.5 pg/mL (IQR 55-162) at\nday 7 to 150 pg/mL (78-209) at day 120 when total sperm count\nrecovered. In motile spermatozoa obtained after density gradient\nseparation, Zika virus RNA was found in 3 of 14 patients at day 7, 4\nof 15 at day 11, and 4 of 15 at day 20, and replication-competent\nvirus was found in the tested patient. Seminal shedding kinetics\nseemed heterogeneous among patients. Whole blood was the fluid most\nfrequently positive for Zika virus RNA (62 of 92 samples) and 3\npatients remained positive at day 120. Interpretation\nSemen alterations early after acute Zika virus infection might affect\nfertility and could be explained by virus effects on the testis and\nepididymis. Frequency of shedding and high viral load in semen,\ntogether with the presence of replicative virus in a motile\nspermatozoa fraction, can lead to Zika virus transmission during\nsexual contact and assisted reproduction procedures. Whole blood seems\nto be the best specimen for Zika virus RNA detection, diagnosis, and\nfollow-up. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall In a new study that included 12 men in French Guiana who had Zika\nvirus, 4 never had any detectable Zika in their semen, 1 excreted Zika\nvirus in his semen for at least 3 days, and 7 had Zika virus in semen\nfor at least 1 month.

JAMA. 2017; 318(8):\n689. doi:10.1001/jama.2017.11200\n-\nResearchers funded in part by the National Institutes of Health have\nrecently demonstrated that 2 experimental vaccines can restrict\ntransmission of Zika virus from pregnant mice to their fetuses,\nthereby shielding offspring from congenital damage or death. Multiple candidate Zika vaccines have been shown protective against\ninfection with the virus in animal studies, with several now in human\ntrials, but none were tested in the context of pregnancy, according to\nthe authors of the study published in Cell\n(http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(17)30759-6). The 2\nvaccine candidates investigated in the new study are the 1st to\ndemonstrate efficacy in preventing vertical transmission of the virus\nand related fetal death in an animal model. Although the vaccines were\nadministered to female mice prior to pregnancy, the result is\nconsidered an important step toward developing a vaccine that could be\nsafely given to pregnant women. One of the 2 candidates is a modified messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine\nencoding Zika genes, developed by the biotechnology company Moderna.\nIt is already in safety trials in women who are not pregnant. The\nother is a live-attenuated Zika strain developed by researchers at the\nUniversity of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). The testing was carried out by scientists from the National Institute\nof Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Washington University School of\nMedicine, and UTMB. The researchers 1st vaccinated the mice with 1 of\nthe vaccines or a placebo. After mating, the animals were challenged\nwith the virus 6 days into pregnancy. A week later, more than 50\npercent of placentas and fetuses from mice administered the mRNA\nvaccine had virtually no Zika RNA. The remainder had \"substantially\nlower\" levels relative to placebo.\nThe live vaccine provided broader protection: 78 percent of placentas\nand 83 percent of fetuses had Zika RNA at or below the level of\ndetection, while the placebo group exhibited significantly higher\nlevels of placental and fetal Zika RNA. Mice vaccinated with either\nvaccine had significantly higher rates of fetal viability; whereas 100\npercent of fetuses from mice vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine were\nborn, none survived to term in the placebo group. A working group funded by the Wellcome Trust recently approved ethical\nguidelines for testing such vaccines in pregnant women, normally\nexcluded from drug trials. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) It is reassuring to learn that at least 2 vaccines are now entering\nclinical trials in women. Although anti-Zika virus drugs are under\ndevelopment, preventing infection through vaccination seems to be the\nmost effective measure to prevent fetal infection and adverse effects\nof the virus infection in adults. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Qatar":{},"Romania":{"114":{"title":"Measles update (43): Asia and Pacific, Europe, demographics\r\n\t","date":["26","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Measles update (43): Asia and Pacific, Europe, demographics\r\n\t[EXTERNAL]","summary":" A ProMED-mail post (http://www.promedmail.org) ProMED-mail is a program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases (http://www.isid.org)  In this update: Asia and Pacific  <br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Japan: travel alert <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Australia (Perth, Western Australia): ex Italy  Europe  <br><br><strong>{3}</strong> Germany (Berlin): 2014-15 <br><br><strong>{4}</strong> Romania  Measles immunity gaps  <br><br><strong>{5}</strong> Role of demographics   Asia and Pacific  <br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Japan: travel alert.

The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare is advising tourists to go to hospital if they develop a high fever or generalized rash after returning to Japan.  Although the World Health Organization verified that Japan has eliminated infections of endemic measles strains in 2015, group infections originating from people who contracted the disease abroad are spreading in the country. As of 6 Aug 2017, the number of patients reached 169 this year in Japan, already eclipsing the figure in the previous year.  About 4100 patients in Italy and around 6500 patients in Romania have already been confirmed as of August 2017 compared with about 860 and 2000, respectively, throughout 2016, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.  Symptoms of the highly contagious disease include runny nose, red and watery eyes, high fever, and rash. The virus is spread through coughing and sneezing and can cause complications such as pneumonia and can even result in death in one in 1000 patients, according to the ministry. The ministry recommends people traveling overseas to check their vaccination records and take an additional shot if they have only been vaccinated once.  The disease was prevalent about a decade ago in Japan with the number of patients soaring to over 10 000 in 2008 but the country was later considered as free from infections of the virus.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Japan can be found at (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/156). - Mod.LK   <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Australia (Perth, Western Australia): ex Italy.

Large measles outbreak introduced by asylum seekers and spread among the insufficiently vaccinated resident population, Berlin, October 2014 to August 2015. Euro Surveill. 2017; 22(34): pii=30599 - Abstract  The largest measles outbreak in Berlin since 2001 occurred from October 2014 to August 2015. Overall, 1344 cases were ascertained, 86 per cent (with available information) unvaccinated, including 146 (12 per cent) asylum seekers. Median age was 17 years (interquartile range: 4-29 years), 26 per cent were hospitalised and a 1 year old child died. Measles virus genotyping uniformly revealed the variant 'D8-Rostov-Don' and descendants. The virus was likely introduced by and initially spread among asylum seekers before affecting Berlin's resident population. Among Berlin residents, the highest incidence was in children younger than 2 years, yet most cases (52 per cent) were adults. Post-exposure vaccinations in homes for asylum seekers, not always conducted, occurred later (median: 7.5 days) than the recommended 72 hours after onset of the 1st case and reached only half of potential contacts. Asylum seekers should not only have non-discriminatory, equitable access to vaccination, they also need to be offered measles vaccination in a timely fashion, that is, immediately upon arrival in the receiving country. Supplementary immunisation activities targeting the resident population, particularly adults, are urgently needed in Berlin.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail.

A 10 month old girl, who was a refugee from Iraq, became the 33rd person to die of the infection, reports local Digi24. The girl arrived in Romania on 7 Jul 2017 with her family, and the doctors diagnosed her with measles in August. They also discovered that the child was suffering from malnutrition and severe psychomotor retardation.  The measles outbreak is still a major problem in Romania, with more than 8900 cases reported across the country until 25 Aug 2017, including 33 deaths, according to data from the National Center for Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases (CNSCBT). Most deaths were registered in Timis (9), Dolj (7), and Arad (6) counties.  Measles is a highly contagious respiratory infection caused by a virus. It causes a total-body skin rash and flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough, and runny nose. According to information posted on WHO's website, the virus is highly contagious, spreading by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact, and direct contact with infected nasal or throat secretions. Unvaccinated young children pose the highest risk of measles and its complications, including death.  The Romanian Government adopted earlier this month August 2017 a draft bill on the organization and financing of population vaccination (https://www.romania-insider.com/romania-draft-bill-vaccination/). The project was sent to the Parliament for approval and could come into force in January 2018.  byline: Irina Marica   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Measles tends to be more severe in children who are malnourished, especially children who are also vitamin A deficient. And complications are commoner and more serious in malnourished children. Because of complications such as diarrhoea, measles may lead to failure to thrive. Infection with measles virus may lead to kwashiorkor or marasmus in children who are underweight at the time that they get infected. Therefore, measles may result in, or aggravate, malnutrition.

Source: News-Medical/Life Sciences (edited) (https://www.news-medical.net/news/20170826/New-study-highlights-role-played-by-demographics-in-the-spread-of-measles.aspx)   Even if the incidence of measles infection has decreased by at least 90 per cent worldwide since the introduction of the vaccine, measles is still one of the major causes of death in children among vaccine-preventable diseases. Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world.  A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries.  Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years.  \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\"  \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea\".  The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years 2 million DALYs since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln 13 million DALYs in the US, and 36-mln 36 million DALYs in Ethiopia.  \"Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,\" continues Prof Melegaro \"our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population. Tailoring immunization campaigns to achieve measles eradication goals is essential and currently, for some countries, this means considering also the role of unprotected adolescents and young adults.\"   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Reference - Trentini F, Poletti P, Merler S, Melegaro A.

The total amount of dead wild boars discovered in the woods around\nZlín, in the far east of the Czech Republic, stood at 94 at the end\nof August 2017. In this month, 23 new infected carcasses were found,\nwhich is a downward trend from July 2017, when 68 reports were sent\nto the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). The 1st report of\nASF in Czech wild boars was on Wed 21 Jun 2017. Many neighbouring countries have alerted their local pig producers to\nbe very careful what to feed their pigs - and their inhabitants what\nto purchase and how to dispose of it. So did Slovakia, according to\nthe Slovak Spectator. Zlín is only a few km away from the western\nSlovak border, to its north is Poland where ASF has been around since\n2014 and on its eastern border is Ukraine, where ASF has been\nconfirmed since 2011. In a presentation, given in mid-July 2017 to the European\nCommission's Standing Committee On Animals, Plants, Food and Feed\n(SCoPAFF), Dr Petr Šatrán of the Czech State Veterinary\nAdministration indicated that human activities are most likely the\ncause of the spread of the virus, seeing that the nearest reported\ncases of ASF were roughly 500 km 310.68 mi away and that the\npositive dead wild boars were found in inhabited areas. In the other country where ASF was found for the 1st time in 2017,\nRomania, things appear relatively quiet. News broke early this month\nAugust 2017 that ASF was also found on 2 backyard farms in the north\nof the country. Ever since, the Romanian authorities did not report\nany further outbreaks of ASF to the OIE. Of all other countries in the European Union, especially Poland has\ncontinued to report outbreaks of African Swine Fever in smaller and\nmiddle-sized operations. In August alone, on 23 farm sites of various\nsizes, ASF was found to have infected at least one animal, after which\nthe entire herd would have to be culled. The biggest operation in this respect was a farm near Monki, Podlaskie\nprovince, where all remaining 431 pigs had to be culled after 11 had\ndied as a result of ASF, on Sat 19 Aug 2017. Noteworthy as well was\nthe ASF-related closure of 2 farms in Lack, Lubelskie province, in\nearly August. These farms had 136 and 141 pigs respectively see also\nitem 2.

ASF, a viral disease against which no vaccine has become available so\nfar, is currently threatening central and western Europe, where dense\npopulations of wild boar are present. According to a recent update of DEFRA (UK) ASF situation assessment,\nthe continuing cases in the Czech Republic, the spread in Poland which\nappears to be due to several breakdowns in biosecurity and the new\noutbreaks in Romania are \"concerning\". This signifies a spread in\ngeographic distribution, a possible drop in biosecurity awareness and\ntherefore an increase in the weight of infection in East Europe. Despite the relatively low level of trade in live pigs, there could be\na substantial movement of people, vehicles and personal imports of\npork products, therefore the risk of ASF introduction to the UK has\nbeen raised from \"very low\" (that is, \"rare but could occur\") to\n\"low\". The Russian veterinary watchdog Rosselkhoznadzor believes ASF will\nkeep moving west via 2 main pathways. The southerly route, has already\nseen the virus spread from Ukraine to Moldova. Russian vets believe it\ncould penetrate central Romania, then move to the Balkans, including\nBulgaria and Serbia. On the northern route, now that ASF has been found in the Czech\nRepublic, Rosselkhoznadzor believes, if it gains a foothold, it is\nlikely to head further west, with Germany next in the firing line.

The following information has been received in reponse to yesterday's (30 Aug 2017) RFI (see http://promedmail.org/post/20170830.5282993). - Mod.AS  * <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Kazakhstan, vaccines applied, compensations to farmers. Date: Thu, 31 Aug 2017. From: A reliable source known to ProMED who preferred to remain unnamed   In response to ProMED-mail's RFI in http://promedmail.org/post/20170830.5282993:  1. Two vaccines are being applied in Kazakhstan to protect cattle against LSD: a. A Russian sheep pox vaccine (effectiveness under question) with unknown dosage; b. Neethling homologous live attenuated vaccine Lumpivax (MSD Animal Health). This vaccine is produced in South Africa.  The information on a Kenyan vaccine as being applied in Kazakhstan is not confirmed.  2. In the absence of official diagnosis of LSD, farmers will not be entitled to receive compensation. However, in Kazakhstan, they may diagnose \"pasteurellosis,\" and people will get their compensation that way. In such case, one will not know whether the actual case was related to LSD or another etiological disease agent.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. \n(promed@promedmail.org)  ProMED-mail is indebted to the submitter of the above information.  The comment on pasteurellosis (sometimes termed as hemorrhagic septicaemia), which is often a secondary infection, as a potentially substitutional diagnosis is rather concerning (see http://promedmail.org/post/20160717.4350687, http://promedmail.org/post/20160722.4362368, http://promedmail.org/post/20160723.4365082).  Kazakhstan's compliance with OIE standards, the quality of its national Veterinary Services for a timely and accurate diagnosis of suspected animal diseases, which is essential for their control, prevention and official notification; and the appropriateness of the country's veterinary legislation have been visited in the framework of OIE's PVS Pathway (see (http://www.oie.int/support-to-oie-members/pvs-pathway/)). Following visits of OIE's experts missions, comprehensive evaluation reports of the visited countries are issued, indicating and allowing required improvements or, ideally, confirming the satisfactory prevailing situations.  Out of the 131 missions already implemented, 33 countries have opted to waive the confidentiality of their evaluation reports and/or follow-up reports, which have thus become available on OIE's website at (http://www.oie.int/support-to-oie-members/pvs-evaluations/oie-pvs-evaluation-reports/) and (http://www.oie.int/support-to-oie-members/pvs-evaluations/follow-up-pvs-evaluations/)).  The following 5 Central-Asian countries have been PVS-evaluated: Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Kyrgyzstan's report is publicly available. - Mod.AS  ProMED HealthMaps: Orenburg Oblast, Russia: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/420) Atyrau, Kazakhstan: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/46186)  ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Russian Federation":{},"Rwanda":{},"St Kitts and Nevis":{},"St Lucia":{},"St Martin":{},"Saint Vincent and the Grenadines":{},"Samoa":{"115":{"title":"Dengue/DHF update (10): Asia, Pacific, Africa, research, WHO\r\n\t","date":["25","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Dengue/DHF update (10): Asia, Pacific, Africa, research, WHO\r\n\t[EXTERNAL]","summary":"\nDENGUE/DHF UPDATE (10): ASIA, PACIFIC, AFRICA, RESEARCH, WHO\n\nA ProMED-mail post\n(http://www.promedmail.org)\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n(http://www.isid.org) In this update:\n<br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Cases in various countries Asia\n\nSri Lanka\n- National\n- National\n- National\nIndia\n- National\n- Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Assam\n- Delhi\n- Tamil Nadu (Coimbatore)\n- Tamil Nadu\n- Tamil Nadu (Chennai)\n- Tamil Nadu (Chennai)\n- Kerala\n- Karnataka\n- Karnataka (Gulbarga)\n- Karnataka (Gulbarga)\n- West Bengal (Kolkata)\n- West Bengal (Birbhum)\n- West Bengal (Siliguri)\n- Odisha (Ganjam)\n- Odisha\n- Gujarat (Ahmedabad)\n- Jharkhand (Jamshedpur)\n- Telangana (Hyderabad)\nPakistan\n- Sindh (Karachi)\n- Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (Peshawar)\n- Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (Peshawar)\n- Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (Peshawar)\nChina\n- Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region ex Viet Nam (susp)\n- Hong Kong SAR\n- Macau SAR\n- Macau SAR\nTaiwan\nMyanmar\n- National\n- Kayah\nIndonesia\n- Papua (Jayapura)\nViet Nam\n- National\n- National\n- Mekong Delta\n- Hanoi\n- Ha Nam\nPhilippines\n- National\n- Cebu\n- Negros Occidental\n- Negros Occidental (Bacolod City)\n- Cavite (Trece Martires City)\nLaos\n- National\nJapan ex Côte d'Ivoire Pacific\n\n- Samoa\n- Samoa\n- Samoa\n- Samoa\n- Fiji\n- French Polynesia (Tahiti) Africa\n\n- Côte d'Ivoire\n- Côte d'Ivoire <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Research\n- Viral persistence\n- Air travel related spread of dengue\n- Visual impact <br><br><strong>{3}</strong> World Health Organization update \n<br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Cases in various countries\nAsia\n\nSri Lanka\n- National. 26 Jul 2017.

In an earlier study done in New Delhi, such multiple\ndengue serotype infections were reported in only 19 per cent of cases.\nAll 4 dengue serotypes were detected in almost equal number in blood\nsamples, unlike in an earlier study conducted in New Delhi wherein one\nserotype was found to be dominating. This has been indicated as a\npossible reason for the high prevalence of infection due to more than\none dengue serotype. Another finding of concern is that DEN-4 strain,\nresembling the one detected in Pune in 2009, was detected in as many\nas 11 samples. DEN-4 is associated with unusual symptoms like\nrespiratory distress, pleural effusion, and elevated levels of liver\nenzymes.

This came about after 2\nkidney recipients in Taiwan were diagnosed with dengue 2 days after\nreceiving a kidney each from the same donor, said National Cheng Kung\nUniversity microbiology and immunology professor Dr Oscar Perng\nGuey-chuen. \"This indicates a potential risk,\" the Taiwan-based\nscientist said, adding that no dengue virus was detected in the\ndonor's blood. He said the donor contracted dengue in 2015 and in mid-2016, he died\nin an accident. His family donated his corneas, liver, heart, and\nkidneys. Both patients had the same strain of the dengue virus the\ndonor had in 2015 and one of the recipients died of dengue\nhaemorrhagic fever, he said. Asked where the virus could be hiding since it could not be detected\nin the blood, he said it was a question scientists are trying to\nanswer. Interestingly, those who received the donor's corneas, liver,\nand heart did not develop dengue, Dr Perng said on the sidelines of\nthe National Dengue And Arboviruses Infection Conference 2017\nyesterday 12 Aug 2017. He said although there was not enough\nevidence to show the virus came from the donor as the kidneys were not\ntested for dengue before the transplant, the same virus was found in\nthe patients' bodies after that. Dr Perng said his team had studied mice for dengue virus in the blood\ntestes, kidney, liver, spleen and brain, and found the virus present\nin the kidneys and brain. \"We believe the virus probably resided in\nthe kidneys and was not cleared by the body,\" he said, adding that the\nvirus could have been activated after transplant. He said this raised\nconcerns about asymptomatic people who are dengue carriers. Health Ministry deputy director, general Datuk Dr S Jeyaindran said\npatients with severe dengue would have better recovery if they were\ngiven colloids, a more concentrated fluid, at the early stage in fluid\nmanagement for dengue patients. Dr Jeyaindran, who was representing\nHealth Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam, said colloids may be\nintroduced at an earlier stage, instead of saline because it has not\nbeen successful in treating patients with severe dengue. He said more\nstudies will be conducted to find out at which stage the colloids\nshould be given. byline: Loh Foon Fong \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) - Air travel related spread of dengue.\nDate: Thu 3 Aug 2017.\nSource: Medical Xpress (edited)\n(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-08-air-responsible-dengue-asia.html) \nWhile the incidences of many other infectious diseases have declined\nover the past decade, the number of cases and outbreaks of dengue\nvirus have continued to increase. The spread of dengue to new areas is\nlikely due in large part to trends in air travel, researchers now\nreport in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Dengue virus affects as estimated 390 million people around the globe\neach year, and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild fever and\nheadache to severe low blood pressure. The virus has mostly caused\ndisease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, but a 2014\noutbreak in Japan broke that pattern. Overall, the geographic area\naffected by dengue has been growing in recent years. In the new work, Huaiyu Tian and Bing Xu, both of Beijing Normal\nUniversity, China, together with colleagues from the University of\nOxford and elsewhere analyzed the spread of dengue viruses in Asia\nfrom 1956 to 2015. They used 2202 genetic sequences of dengue viruses,\ncollected in 20 countries or regions of Asia over the 59 years, to\ndetermine how different strains were related. They also investigated\ntrends in air travel, maritime mobility, migration, and\nsocio-economics to determine what factors impact the spread of\ndengue. The spread of 3 different dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1, -2, and -3,\nis associated with air traffic more so than any other factors, the\ndata revealed. Air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India, the\nresearchers found, help seed dengue epidemics, while China, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, and Singapore help diffuse the virus to other Asian\ncountries. \"Future trends in global mobility could potentially accelerate the\nappearance and diffusion of DENV worldwide,\" the researchers say.\n\"Prevention and control of dengue epidemics requires a better\nunderstanding of its mode of geographic dissemination, especially for\ncountries in the tropics.\" Reference: Tian H, Sun Z, Faria NR, et al.

Clearly\ntransmission is continuing in this area, with 3 newly confirmed\nsecondary cases in household contacts - at least 2 of whom were\nidentified through screening of asymptomatic household contacts, and 2\nadditional cases in which high risk exposures are still under\ninvestigation. We do not know if these household contacts are\nassociated with the earlier identified transmission chain in Dawmat\nAljandal or if these are newly identified chains of transmission. The\nother 2 newly confirmed cases involve \"sporadic\" cases - an individual\nin Hail whose high risk exposure history is still under investigation,\nand an individual from Alaflaj (Riyadh region) with a history of\ndirect contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. As to be expected, concern is being voiced on the international level\nwith the upcoming Hajj and this recent increase in cases reported both\nin Saudi Arabia and in the UAE. We now have gone through 5 Hajj\nperiods since the identification of the MERS-CoV and to date there\nhave been no cases of MERS-CoV infection identified in returning\nHajjis. The case in the UAE (see section <br><br><strong>{1}</strong> above) actually had onset\nof illness over 1 month ago with no secondary cases/infections\nidentified among known contacts of this case. As for the cases in\nSaudi Arabia, and more specifically the Hajj, population movement is\nvery well defined during the Hajj, no camels are permitted in the\nareas where Hajjis are congregated, and there are Hajj specific health\nservices that are separate from those that are available for the\ngeneral Saudi population, all factors that are reducing the likelihood\nof Hajjis having inadvertent (or intentional) high risk exposures.\nHopefully my optimism is well placed and we will pass through a 6th\nHajj period without impact on international transmission of the\nMERS-CoV associated with this Hajj.

The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare is advising tourists to go to hospital if they develop a high fever or generalized rash after returning to Japan.  Although the World Health Organization verified that Japan has eliminated infections of endemic measles strains in 2015, group infections originating from people who contracted the disease abroad are spreading in the country. As of 6 Aug 2017, the number of patients reached 169 this year in Japan, already eclipsing the figure in the previous year.  About 4100 patients in Italy and around 6500 patients in Romania have already been confirmed as of August 2017 compared with about 860 and 2000, respectively, throughout 2016, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.  Symptoms of the highly contagious disease include runny nose, red and watery eyes, high fever, and rash. The virus is spread through coughing and sneezing and can cause complications such as pneumonia and can even result in death in one in 1000 patients, according to the ministry. The ministry recommends people traveling overseas to check their vaccination records and take an additional shot if they have only been vaccinated once.  The disease was prevalent about a decade ago in Japan with the number of patients soaring to over 10 000 in 2008 but the country was later considered as free from infections of the virus.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Japan can be found at (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/156). - Mod.LK   <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Australia (Perth, Western Australia): ex Italy.

Large measles outbreak introduced by asylum seekers and spread among the insufficiently vaccinated resident population, Berlin, October 2014 to August 2015. Euro Surveill. 2017; 22(34): pii=30599 - Abstract  The largest measles outbreak in Berlin since 2001 occurred from October 2014 to August 2015. Overall, 1344 cases were ascertained, 86 per cent (with available information) unvaccinated, including 146 (12 per cent) asylum seekers. Median age was 17 years (interquartile range: 4-29 years), 26 per cent were hospitalised and a 1 year old child died. Measles virus genotyping uniformly revealed the variant 'D8-Rostov-Don' and descendants. The virus was likely introduced by and initially spread among asylum seekers before affecting Berlin's resident population. Among Berlin residents, the highest incidence was in children younger than 2 years, yet most cases (52 per cent) were adults. Post-exposure vaccinations in homes for asylum seekers, not always conducted, occurred later (median: 7.5 days) than the recommended 72 hours after onset of the 1st case and reached only half of potential contacts. Asylum seekers should not only have non-discriminatory, equitable access to vaccination, they also need to be offered measles vaccination in a timely fashion, that is, immediately upon arrival in the receiving country. Supplementary immunisation activities targeting the resident population, particularly adults, are urgently needed in Berlin.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail.

Source: Romania Insider (edited) (https://www.romania-insider.com/measles-kills-iraqi-refugee/)   The ongoing measles outbreak keeps making victims in Romania. A 10 month old girl, who was a refugee from Iraq, became the 33rd person to die of the infection, reports local Digi24. The girl arrived in Romania on 7 Jul 2017 with her family, and the doctors diagnosed her with measles in August. They also discovered that the child was suffering from malnutrition and severe psychomotor retardation.  The measles outbreak is still a major problem in Romania, with more than 8900 cases reported across the country until 25 Aug 2017, including 33 deaths, according to data from the National Center for Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases (CNSCBT). Most deaths were registered in Timis (9), Dolj (7), and Arad (6) counties.  Measles is a highly contagious respiratory infection caused by a virus. It causes a total-body skin rash and flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough, and runny nose. According to information posted on WHO's website, the virus is highly contagious, spreading by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact, and direct contact with infected nasal or throat secretions. Unvaccinated young children pose the highest risk of measles and its complications, including death.  The Romanian Government adopted earlier this month August 2017 a draft bill on the organization and financing of population vaccination (https://www.romania-insider.com/romania-draft-bill-vaccination/). The project was sent to the Parliament for approval and could come into force in January 2018.  byline: Irina Marica   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Measles tends to be more severe in children who are malnourished, especially children who are also vitamin A deficient. And complications are commoner and more serious in malnourished children. Because of complications such as diarrhoea, measles may lead to failure to thrive. Infection with measles virus may lead to kwashiorkor or marasmus in children who are underweight at the time that they get infected. Therefore, measles may result in, or aggravate, malnutrition.

Date: Sat 26 Aug 2017. Source: News-Medical/Life Sciences (edited) (https://www.news-medical.net/news/20170826/New-study-highlights-role-played-by-demographics-in-the-spread-of-measles.aspx)   Even if the incidence of measles infection has decreased by at least 90 per cent worldwide since the introduction of the vaccine, measles is still one of the major causes of death in children among vaccine-preventable diseases. Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world.  A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries.  Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years.  \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\"  \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea\".  The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years 2 million DALYs since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln 13 million DALYs in the US, and 36-mln 36 million DALYs in Ethiopia.  \"Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,\" continues Prof Melegaro \"our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population.

This came about after 2\nkidney recipients in Taiwan were diagnosed with dengue 2 days after\nreceiving a kidney each from the same donor, said National Cheng Kung\nUniversity microbiology and immunology professor Dr Oscar Perng\nGuey-chuen. \"This indicates a potential risk,\" the Taiwan-based\nscientist said, adding that no dengue virus was detected in the\ndonor's blood. He said the donor contracted dengue in 2015 and in mid-2016, he died\nin an accident. His family donated his corneas, liver, heart, and\nkidneys. Both patients had the same strain of the dengue virus the\ndonor had in 2015 and one of the recipients died of dengue\nhaemorrhagic fever, he said. Asked where the virus could be hiding since it could not be detected\nin the blood, he said it was a question scientists are trying to\nanswer. Interestingly, those who received the donor's corneas, liver,\nand heart did not develop dengue, Dr Perng said on the sidelines of\nthe National Dengue And Arboviruses Infection Conference 2017\nyesterday 12 Aug 2017. He said although there was not enough\nevidence to show the virus came from the donor as the kidneys were not\ntested for dengue before the transplant, the same virus was found in\nthe patients' bodies after that. Dr Perng said his team had studied mice for dengue virus in the blood\ntestes, kidney, liver, spleen and brain, and found the virus present\nin the kidneys and brain. \"We believe the virus probably resided in\nthe kidneys and was not cleared by the body,\" he said, adding that the\nvirus could have been activated after transplant. He said this raised\nconcerns about asymptomatic people who are dengue carriers. Health Ministry deputy director, general Datuk Dr S Jeyaindran said\npatients with severe dengue would have better recovery if they were\ngiven colloids, a more concentrated fluid, at the early stage in fluid\nmanagement for dengue patients. Dr Jeyaindran, who was representing\nHealth Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam, said colloids may be\nintroduced at an earlier stage, instead of saline because it has not\nbeen successful in treating patients with severe dengue. He said more\nstudies will be conducted to find out at which stage the colloids\nshould be given. byline: Loh Foon Fong \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) - Air travel related spread of dengue.\nDate: Thu 3 Aug 2017.\nSource: Medical Xpress (edited)\n(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-08-air-responsible-dengue-asia.html) \nWhile the incidences of many other infectious diseases have declined\nover the past decade, the number of cases and outbreaks of dengue\nvirus have continued to increase. The spread of dengue to new areas is\nlikely due in large part to trends in air travel, researchers now\nreport in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Dengue virus affects as estimated 390 million people around the globe\neach year, and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild fever and\nheadache to severe low blood pressure. The virus has mostly caused\ndisease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, but a 2014\noutbreak in Japan broke that pattern. Overall, the geographic area\naffected by dengue has been growing in recent years. In the new work, Huaiyu Tian and Bing Xu, both of Beijing Normal\nUniversity, China, together with colleagues from the University of\nOxford and elsewhere analyzed the spread of dengue viruses in Asia\nfrom 1956 to 2015. They used 2202 genetic sequences of dengue viruses,\ncollected in 20 countries or regions of Asia over the 59 years, to\ndetermine how different strains were related. They also investigated\ntrends in air travel, maritime mobility, migration, and\nsocio-economics to determine what factors impact the spread of\ndengue. The spread of 3 different dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1, -2, and -3,\nis associated with air traffic more so than any other factors, the\ndata revealed. Air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India, the\nresearchers found, help seed dengue epidemics, while China, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, and Singapore help diffuse the virus to other Asian\ncountries. \"Future trends in global mobility could potentially accelerate the\nappearance and diffusion of DENV worldwide,\" the researchers say.\n\"Prevention and control of dengue epidemics requires a better\nunderstanding of its mode of geographic dissemination, especially for\ncountries in the tropics.\" Reference: Tian H, Sun Z, Faria NR, et al.

NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in\npress): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons,\nvaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside\nof Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as\n60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection\nlengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:\n- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam;\n- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however,\nhave suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be\neffective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and\noutbreak situations (63, 64). \"References\n\n57.

The 1st one is for the risk mitigation to be conducted in South Africa through stringent quarantine measures on arrival of the hatching eggs from their country of origin.\" Molapo said that the 2nd option would be for stringent quarantine measures in the country of origin where eggs will come from compartments free of specified diseases that DAFF would approve, with less stringent post arrival quarantine measures.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  South Africa's follow-up report No 8 on HPAI H5N8, was submitted to the OIE on Fri 25 Aug 2017.

This came about after 2\nkidney recipients in Taiwan were diagnosed with dengue 2 days after\nreceiving a kidney each from the same donor, said National Cheng Kung\nUniversity microbiology and immunology professor Dr Oscar Perng\nGuey-chuen. \"This indicates a potential risk,\" the Taiwan-based\nscientist said, adding that no dengue virus was detected in the\ndonor's blood. He said the donor contracted dengue in 2015 and in mid-2016, he died\nin an accident. His family donated his corneas, liver, heart, and\nkidneys. Both patients had the same strain of the dengue virus the\ndonor had in 2015 and one of the recipients died of dengue\nhaemorrhagic fever, he said. Asked where the virus could be hiding since it could not be detected\nin the blood, he said it was a question scientists are trying to\nanswer. Interestingly, those who received the donor's corneas, liver,\nand heart did not develop dengue, Dr Perng said on the sidelines of\nthe National Dengue And Arboviruses Infection Conference 2017\nyesterday 12 Aug 2017. He said although there was not enough\nevidence to show the virus came from the donor as the kidneys were not\ntested for dengue before the transplant, the same virus was found in\nthe patients' bodies after that. Dr Perng said his team had studied mice for dengue virus in the blood\ntestes, kidney, liver, spleen and brain, and found the virus present\nin the kidneys and brain. \"We believe the virus probably resided in\nthe kidneys and was not cleared by the body,\" he said, adding that the\nvirus could have been activated after transplant. He said this raised\nconcerns about asymptomatic people who are dengue carriers. Health Ministry deputy director, general Datuk Dr S Jeyaindran said\npatients with severe dengue would have better recovery if they were\ngiven colloids, a more concentrated fluid, at the early stage in fluid\nmanagement for dengue patients. Dr Jeyaindran, who was representing\nHealth Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam, said colloids may be\nintroduced at an earlier stage, instead of saline because it has not\nbeen successful in treating patients with severe dengue. He said more\nstudies will be conducted to find out at which stage the colloids\nshould be given. byline: Loh Foon Fong \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) - Air travel related spread of dengue.\nDate: Thu 3 Aug 2017.\nSource: Medical Xpress (edited)\n(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-08-air-responsible-dengue-asia.html) \nWhile the incidences of many other infectious diseases have declined\nover the past decade, the number of cases and outbreaks of dengue\nvirus have continued to increase. The spread of dengue to new areas is\nlikely due in large part to trends in air travel, researchers now\nreport in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Dengue virus affects as estimated 390 million people around the globe\neach year, and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild fever and\nheadache to severe low blood pressure. The virus has mostly caused\ndisease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, but a 2014\noutbreak in Japan broke that pattern. Overall, the geographic area\naffected by dengue has been growing in recent years. In the new work, Huaiyu Tian and Bing Xu, both of Beijing Normal\nUniversity, China, together with colleagues from the University of\nOxford and elsewhere analyzed the spread of dengue viruses in Asia\nfrom 1956 to 2015. They used 2202 genetic sequences of dengue viruses,\ncollected in 20 countries or regions of Asia over the 59 years, to\ndetermine how different strains were related. They also investigated\ntrends in air travel, maritime mobility, migration, and\nsocio-economics to determine what factors impact the spread of\ndengue. The spread of 3 different dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1, -2, and -3,\nis associated with air traffic more so than any other factors, the\ndata revealed. Air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India, the\nresearchers found, help seed dengue epidemics, while China, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, and Singapore help diffuse the virus to other Asian\ncountries. \"Future trends in global mobility could potentially accelerate the\nappearance and diffusion of DENV worldwide,\" the researchers say.\n\"Prevention and control of dengue epidemics requires a better\nunderstanding of its mode of geographic dissemination, especially for\ncountries in the tropics.\" Reference: Tian H, Sun Z, Faria NR, et al.

Source: IOL (edited) (https://www.iol.co.za/capetimes/news/avian-flu-kills-30-000-chickens-on-farm-as-egg-scare-grows-10962801)   Avian flu has spread to a commercial layer poultry farm in the Western Cape province, killing at least 30 000 chickens. There are 140 000 chickens on the affected farm in the Paardeberg region, according to the provincial department of agriculture head of communication, Petro van Rhyn. She confirmed that at least 30 000 have died and said the rest would be culled.  The virus has not yet been confirmed as the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) type H5N8, which is the strain in outbreaks in other parts of the country. However, the H5 typing, and the nature of its effect on chickens, is indicative of it being the H5N8 strain, according to the department.  \nThe poultry industry raised concerns related to the principles and guidelines of compensating affected farms during a meeting with Zokwana last week. The draft guidelines have been completed and are subject to ministerial approval, Molapo said. The approved guidelines will be released by 1 Sep 2017.  \"The industry also requested to be given permission to import fertile eggs to close the supply gap as a result of culled birds.  \n\"Only one company has submitted an application for the importation of hatching eggs; the department is still performing the prescribed risk analyses to determine the appropriate level of risk.  \"We need to conduct a thorough risk assessment in order to avoid exposing the country to other disease risks,\" Molapo said.  There are 2 options which will be presented to the poultry industry - the 1st is for risk mitigation to be conducted in SA through stringent quarantine measures on arrival of the hatching eggs from their country of origin.  The 2nd option is for stringent quarantine measures in the country of origin where eggs will come from compartments free of specified diseases that Daff will approve, with less stringent post-arrival quarantine measures.  In Heidelberg a Western Cape town, 3 ostrich farms have tested positive for avian flu. No birds have died on the farms but they remain under quarantine. The 2 farms each have about 1000 ostriches. Van Rhyn said no decision to cull ostriches has been taken yet. She also said chicken in stores was safe for consumption.  \nBronwynne Jooste, spokesperson for Tourism, Economic Development and Agriculture MEC Alan Winde, said culling of the rest of the chickens and composting of mortalities had already been started.  Last week, the department's Veterinary Services programme confirmed the disease had spread to the farm. \"The cause is most likely through contact with wild birds. Since then, meetings with poultry veterinarians and stakeholders such as the National Institute for Communicable Diseases have taken place,\" Jooste said. The farm has been placed under quarantine.  She said farms within a 3 km approx 1.8 mi zone of an infected farm would be monitored closely and subjected to the control measures as laid out by the national Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (Daff)  \"It is strongly recommended that any movement of pet birds, racing pigeons, breeding birds and show birds be limited as far as possible and covered by a movement permit if coming from within 30 km approx 18 mi of an infected farm,\" said Jooste.  \nSick or dead birds - both wild birds and poultry - must be reported to local state vets, and exports of poultry and poultry products have been suspended except from poultry compartments registered with Daff, or where a country's import permit contains clauses that are able to be signed by a certifying veterinarian.  Winde said the virus presented a challenge to control, but the vets were working hard to contain the spread.  \n\"This is a priority for the poultry industry, and the entire agriculture sector. The outbreak and the current drought have made agriculture a tough space to be in.  \n\"This is a particularly difficult time for those affected farms, which are important employers. This is why we ask all stakeholders to continue working with us to mitigate the impact of this outbreak on our economy,\" Winde said.  Avian flu is a viral respiratory disease among birds, believed to be transmitted by wild migratory birds. The H5N8 strain of the disease has already wreaked havoc in the poultry industry in Zimbabwe, where thousands of commercial birds have died or had to be culled.  Bomikazi Molapo, spokesperson for Daff Minister Senzeni Zokwana, said South Africa had reported 8 further cases of HPAI H5N8 to the World Organisation for Animal Health see comment. This brings the total number of outbreaks to 24 since June this year 2017.  \"All affected properties have been placed under quarantine and disease control measures have commenced,\" she said.  \nByline: Lisa Isaacs   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail.

CCHF is a viral disease. Symptoms may include fever, muscle pains, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding into the skin. The CCHF virus is typically spread by tick bites or contact with livestock carrying the disease.  Health officials in Herat advised people to be careful these days due to increased interaction with livestock in the wake of Eidul Adha Sacrifice Feast; 31 Aug-4 Sep 2017, when Muslims across the globe slaughter millions of animals.  Public health director in Herat Abdul Hakim Tamana said many people lost their lives to the Congo virus in the province this year 2017. He said 55 Congo cases were registered in the civil hospital since late March and of the patients, 13 had died. The deceased included 7 men and 6 women, he added.  Tamana said the virus spread from animals and people slaughtering animals should wear gloves.  A livestock farmer, who has contracted Congo virus, said: \"When I slaughtered the sheep, its blood covered my hands and later I started falling sick.\"  Ahmad Khalil Waez, animal healthcare director, said citizens should be careful while slaughtering animals to avoid contracting the Congo virus. He said a butcher should used special glasses, coat, gloves, mask, and shoes while slaughtering the animal.  People mainly contract the CCHF virus from infected ticks or contact with infected animal blood and tissue.  There are no vaccines available to immunize animals but precautionary measures include disinfection of livestock pens, submerging livestock in solutions for decontamination, and meat packaging safeguards.  The virus has had a presence in neighbouring Iran where the virus killed 3 people in 2015.  According to the World Health Organization, CCHF's mortality rate is about 30 percent and is endemic to Africa, the Balkans and Ukraine, the Middle East, and Central Asia.  CCHF was first detected in the Crimea in 1944 and then in the Congo in 1969. In 2011, it was detected for the first time in ticks in Spain.

Later, a cross-sectional seroprevalence survey was conducted among livestock-owning households in the same districts of Herat City where the outbreak had occurred, which showed that IgG seroprevalence was 11.2 and 75.0 percent in humans (n = 330) and livestock (n = 132), respectively ((https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3310665/)).  In 2016, 66 cases had been reported by 7 Sep, with 12 deaths ((http://www.emro.who.int/afg/afghanistan-news/cchf-eid.html)). CCHF virus has been observed in over 30 countries, including in Africa (Democratic Republic of Congo, South Africa, Nigeria, Senegal, Uganda, Tanzania, Mauritania, Kenya), Asia (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, China), the Middle East (Iran, Iraq, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman), and southeastern Europe (the Russian Federation, Bulgaria, Albania, Kosovo, Turkey, Greece, and Spain) ((https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23458713)).  People most at risk of contracting CCHF include animal herders, livestock workers, butchers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Healthcare workers are also at risk of infection through unprotected contact with infectious blood and body fluids while caring for patients. There is no vaccine available for either people or animals, which means prevention is crucial. - Mod.UBA  Maps of Afghanistan can be seen at (http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/afghanistan_admin-2009.jpg) and (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1757). - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ  ","keywordsMatched":[]},"299":{"title":"Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (95): Africa, Asia","date":["31","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (95): Africa, Asia","summary":"\nCHOLERA, DIARRHEA AND DYSENTERY UPDATE (95): AFRICA, ASIA\n*\nA ProMED-mail post\n(http://www.promedmail.org)\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n(http://www.isid.org) In this update:\nAfrica\n\n<br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Cholera - Kenya (Nairobi)\n<br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Cholera - Kenya (Nairobi) police\n<br><br><strong>{3}</strong> Cholera - Kenya (Tana River county)\n<br><br><strong>{4}</strong>, <br><br><strong>{5}</strong> Cholera - Nigeria (Borno state) IDPs\n<br><br><strong>{6}</strong> Cholera - Sudan\n<br><br><strong>{7}</strong> Cholera, diarrhea - Eastern and Southern Africa Region\nAsia\n\n<br><br><strong>{8}</strong> Cholera - Pakistan (Punjab) \nAfrica\n\n<br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Cholera - Kenya (Nairobi).\nDate: Mon 4 Sep 2017 9:09 AM EAT.\nSource: Capital FM (edited)\n(https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2017/09/cholera-cases-in-nairobi-rise-to-88/) \nThe number of people admitted to various hospitals in Nairobi after\ntesting positive for cholera has now risen to 88.

Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:\n- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit.

The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare is advising tourists to go to hospital if they develop a high fever or generalized rash after returning to Japan.  Although the World Health Organization verified that Japan has eliminated infections of endemic measles strains in 2015, group infections originating from people who contracted the disease abroad are spreading in the country. As of 6 Aug 2017, the number of patients reached 169 this year in Japan, already eclipsing the figure in the previous year.  About 4100 patients in Italy and around 6500 patients in Romania have already been confirmed as of August 2017 compared with about 860 and 2000, respectively, throughout 2016, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.  Symptoms of the highly contagious disease include runny nose, red and watery eyes, high fever, and rash. The virus is spread through coughing and sneezing and can cause complications such as pneumonia and can even result in death in one in 1000 patients, according to the ministry. The ministry recommends people traveling overseas to check their vaccination records and take an additional shot if they have only been vaccinated once.  The disease was prevalent about a decade ago in Japan with the number of patients soaring to over 10 000 in 2008 but the country was later considered as free from infections of the virus.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Japan can be found at (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/156). - Mod.LK   <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Australia (Perth, Western Australia): ex Italy.

Large measles outbreak introduced by asylum seekers and spread among the insufficiently vaccinated resident population, Berlin, October 2014 to August 2015. Euro Surveill. 2017; 22(34): pii=30599 - Abstract  The largest measles outbreak in Berlin since 2001 occurred from October 2014 to August 2015. Overall, 1344 cases were ascertained, 86 per cent (with available information) unvaccinated, including 146 (12 per cent) asylum seekers. Median age was 17 years (interquartile range: 4-29 years), 26 per cent were hospitalised and a 1 year old child died. Measles virus genotyping uniformly revealed the variant 'D8-Rostov-Don' and descendants. The virus was likely introduced by and initially spread among asylum seekers before affecting Berlin's resident population. Among Berlin residents, the highest incidence was in children younger than 2 years, yet most cases (52 per cent) were adults. Post-exposure vaccinations in homes for asylum seekers, not always conducted, occurred later (median: 7.5 days) than the recommended 72 hours after onset of the 1st case and reached only half of potential contacts. Asylum seekers should not only have non-discriminatory, equitable access to vaccination, they also need to be offered measles vaccination in a timely fashion, that is, immediately upon arrival in the receiving country. Supplementary immunisation activities targeting the resident population, particularly adults, are urgently needed in Berlin.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail.

They also discovered that the child was suffering from malnutrition and severe psychomotor retardation.  The measles outbreak is still a major problem in Romania, with more than 8900 cases reported across the country until 25 Aug 2017, including 33 deaths, according to data from the National Center for Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases (CNSCBT). Most deaths were registered in Timis (9), Dolj (7), and Arad (6) counties.  Measles is a highly contagious respiratory infection caused by a virus. It causes a total-body skin rash and flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough, and runny nose. According to information posted on WHO's website, the virus is highly contagious, spreading by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact, and direct contact with infected nasal or throat secretions. Unvaccinated young children pose the highest risk of measles and its complications, including death.  The Romanian Government adopted earlier this month August 2017 a draft bill on the organization and financing of population vaccination (https://www.romania-insider.com/romania-draft-bill-vaccination/). The project was sent to the Parliament for approval and could come into force in January 2018.  byline: Irina Marica   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Measles tends to be more severe in children who are malnourished, especially children who are also vitamin A deficient. And complications are commoner and more serious in malnourished children. Because of complications such as diarrhoea, measles may lead to failure to thrive. Infection with measles virus may lead to kwashiorkor or marasmus in children who are underweight at the time that they get infected. Therefore, measles may result in, or aggravate, malnutrition.

Date: Sat 26 Aug 2017. Source: News-Medical/Life Sciences (edited) (https://www.news-medical.net/news/20170826/New-study-highlights-role-played-by-demographics-in-the-spread-of-measles.aspx)   Even if the incidence of measles infection has decreased by at least 90 per cent worldwide since the introduction of the vaccine, measles is still one of the major causes of death in children among vaccine-preventable diseases. Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world.  A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries.  Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years.  \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\"  \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea\".  The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years 2 million DALYs since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln 13 million DALYs in the US, and 36-mln 36 million DALYs in Ethiopia.  \"Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,\" continues Prof Melegaro \"our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population. Tailoring immunization campaigns to achieve measles eradication goals is essential and currently, for some countries, this means considering also the role of unprotected adolescents and young adults.\"   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Reference - Trentini F, Poletti P, Merler S, Melegaro A.

Authorities are not ruling out the possibility that the 8 individuals contracted hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), widely known as \"hamburger disease,\" a bacterial infection that can leave the renal system severely damaged. Many cases are caused by _E. coli_, which can be found in undercooked meat like hamburgers. Children under the age of 5 are particularly vulnerable. On 25 Aug 2017, a group of 15 adults and elementary school students from the same church in Jeonju visited McDonald's Jeonju branch and ate bulgogi burgers together. A day later, 7 children and 1 adult experienced diarrhea and vomiting. The authorities declared an epidemiological probe into the case on Sat 2 Sep 2017.  As the case was publicized, McDonald's Korea halted selling bulgogi burgers nationwide starting on Sat 2 Sep 2017. On its website, a notice says, \"We have decided to stop selling bulgogi burgers pending the outcome of the ongoing investigation by authorities,\" adding that the multinational company's Korean branch was taking the issue seriously. It also said the company will do its best to help patients recover, though without elaborating on how or when.  The outcome of the ongoing probe is expected to be made public around Wed 6 Sep 2017.  The case in Jeonju is not the only incident that the corporation, which has 440 branches in Korea alone, has recently found itself in. In July 2017, the mother of a 5-year-old girl filed a complaint claiming irreparable harm was done to her child because of the fast food chain's mismanagement of its food products. The mother, claimed her daughter contracted HUS after eating a Happy Meal in September 2016, and she now must undergo peritoneal dialysis on a daily basis.  McDonald's Korea branch also received a complaint from the parents of a 2-year-old girl, who began to have diarrhea and bloody excrement after eating a hamburger patty on 17 May 2017 at a Jamsil branch in southern Seoul. On 19 May 2017, the child was admitted to a local emergency room. The child's condition improved and she was discharged later that day.  Byline: Kang Jin-kyu   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Whether this cluster of illnesses is caused by enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ is unknown as yet and ProMED would appreciate more information about the illnesses. A one day incubation period is short for EHEC but the outbreak is occurring in the wake of several cases of EHEC linked to the chain in South Korea.  Classic bulgogi recipes use a marinade of soy, ginger, garlic, and gochujang (Korean chili paste) to flavor and tenderize strips of meat. Because combining a marinade into ground beef would change the consistency of the hamburger, making it more of a \"sloppy-joe\", usually a bulgogi inspired sauce is used on top of the burger although a Korean inspired spice combination can be added to the ground beef.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness\nand disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE,\nAtay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral\nrehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and\nother forms of diarrhea: \"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that\ncholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement,\nand, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not\nuntil 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of\nthe intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could\nbe effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the\nintravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could\nbe just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for\nexample, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy\n(ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the\nmorbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1)\nhighlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn\nBangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per\ncent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as\n\"potentially the most important medical advance\" of the 20th century.\nA variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice\npowder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially\nzinc (5). \"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to\napproximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those\nwith severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously\nwith a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of\n20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg\nover the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser\ndegrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or\nrice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those\nwith no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with\nfrequent reevaluation. \"References\n-\n1.

NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in\npress): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons,\nvaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside\nof Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as\n60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection\nlengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:\n- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam;\n- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses.

Source: Pajhwok Afghan News (edited) (https://www.pajhwok.com/en/2017/08/28/congo-virus-kills-13-infects-42-herat)   Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has killed 13 people in western Herat province this year 2017, with another 42 being treated for the deadly virus, according to officials.  CCHF is a viral disease. Symptoms may include fever, muscle pains, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding into the skin. The CCHF virus is typically spread by tick bites or contact with livestock carrying the disease.  Health officials in Herat advised people to be careful these days due to increased interaction with livestock in the wake of Eidul Adha Sacrifice Feast; 31 Aug-4 Sep 2017, when Muslims across the globe slaughter millions of animals.  Public health director in Herat Abdul Hakim Tamana said many people lost their lives to the Congo virus in the province this year 2017. He said 55 Congo cases were registered in the civil hospital since late March and of the patients, 13 had died. The deceased included 7 men and 6 women, he added.  Tamana said the virus spread from animals and people slaughtering animals should wear gloves.  A livestock farmer, who has contracted Congo virus, said: \"When I slaughtered the sheep, its blood covered my hands and later I started falling sick.\"  Ahmad Khalil Waez, animal healthcare director, said citizens should be careful while slaughtering animals to avoid contracting the Congo virus. He said a butcher should used special glasses, coat, gloves, mask, and shoes while slaughtering the animal.  People mainly contract the CCHF virus from infected ticks or contact with infected animal blood and tissue.  There are no vaccines available to immunize animals but precautionary measures include disinfection of livestock pens, submerging livestock in solutions for decontamination, and meat packaging safeguards.  The virus has had a presence in neighbouring Iran where the virus killed 3 people in 2015.  According to the World Health Organization, CCHF's mortality rate is about 30 percent and is endemic to Africa, the Balkans and Ukraine, the Middle East, and Central Asia.  CCHF was first detected in the Crimea in 1944 and then in the Congo in 1969. In 2011, it was detected for the first time in ticks in Spain.

(promed@promedmail.org)  In 2008, a major outbreak was reported in Herat City, western Afghanistan, with approximately 60 suspected and 6 confirmed cases. Later, a cross-sectional seroprevalence survey was conducted among livestock-owning households in the same districts of Herat City where the outbreak had occurred, which showed that IgG seroprevalence was 11.2 and 75.0 percent in humans (n = 330) and livestock (n = 132), respectively ((https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3310665/)).  In 2016, 66 cases had been reported by 7 Sep, with 12 deaths ((http://www.emro.who.int/afg/afghanistan-news/cchf-eid.html)). CCHF virus has been observed in over 30 countries, including in Africa (Democratic Republic of Congo, South Africa, Nigeria, Senegal, Uganda, Tanzania, Mauritania, Kenya), Asia (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, China), the Middle East (Iran, Iraq, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman), and southeastern Europe (the Russian Federation, Bulgaria, Albania, Kosovo, Turkey, Greece, and Spain) ((https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23458713)).  People most at risk of contracting CCHF include animal herders, livestock workers, butchers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Healthcare workers are also at risk of infection through unprotected contact with infectious blood and body fluids while caring for patients. There is no vaccine available for either people or animals, which means prevention is crucial. - Mod.UBA  Maps of Afghanistan can be seen at (http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/afghanistan_admin-2009.jpg) and (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1757). - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ  ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Sri Lanka":{"115":{"title":"Dengue/DHF update (10): Asia, Pacific, Africa, research, WHO\r\n\t","date":["25","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Dengue/DHF update (10): Asia, Pacific, Africa, research, WHO\r\n\t[EXTERNAL]","summary":"\nDENGUE/DHF UPDATE (10): ASIA, PACIFIC, AFRICA, RESEARCH, WHO\n\nA ProMED-mail post\n(http://www.promedmail.org)\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n(http://www.isid.org) In this update:\n<br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Cases in various countries Asia\n\nSri Lanka\n- National\n- National\n- National\nIndia\n- National\n- Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Assam\n- Delhi\n- Tamil Nadu (Coimbatore)\n- Tamil Nadu\n- Tamil Nadu (Chennai)\n- Tamil Nadu (Chennai)\n- Kerala\n- Karnataka\n- Karnataka (Gulbarga)\n- Karnataka (Gulbarga)\n- West Bengal (Kolkata)\n- West Bengal (Birbhum)\n- West Bengal (Siliguri)\n- Odisha (Ganjam)\n- Odisha\n- Gujarat (Ahmedabad)\n- Jharkhand (Jamshedpur)\n- Telangana (Hyderabad)\nPakistan\n- Sindh (Karachi)\n- Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (Peshawar)\n- Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (Peshawar)\n- Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (Peshawar)\nChina\n- Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region ex Viet Nam (susp)\n- Hong Kong SAR\n- Macau SAR\n- Macau SAR\nTaiwan\nMyanmar\n- National\n- Kayah\nIndonesia\n- Papua (Jayapura)\nViet Nam\n- National\n- National\n- Mekong Delta\n- Hanoi\n- Ha Nam\nPhilippines\n- National\n- Cebu\n- Negros Occidental\n- Negros Occidental (Bacolod City)\n- Cavite (Trece Martires City)\nLaos\n- National\nJapan ex Côte d'Ivoire Pacific\n\n- Samoa\n- Samoa\n- Samoa\n- Samoa\n- Fiji\n- French Polynesia (Tahiti) Africa\n\n- Côte d'Ivoire\n- Côte d'Ivoire <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Research\n- Viral persistence\n- Air travel related spread of dengue\n- Visual impact <br><br><strong>{3}</strong> World Health Organization update \n<br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Cases in various countries\nAsia\n\nSri Lanka\n- National. 26 Jul 2017.

This came about after 2\nkidney recipients in Taiwan were diagnosed with dengue 2 days after\nreceiving a kidney each from the same donor, said National Cheng Kung\nUniversity microbiology and immunology professor Dr Oscar Perng\nGuey-chuen. \"This indicates a potential risk,\" the Taiwan-based\nscientist said, adding that no dengue virus was detected in the\ndonor's blood. He said the donor contracted dengue in 2015 and in mid-2016, he died\nin an accident. His family donated his corneas, liver, heart, and\nkidneys. Both patients had the same strain of the dengue virus the\ndonor had in 2015 and one of the recipients died of dengue\nhaemorrhagic fever, he said. Asked where the virus could be hiding since it could not be detected\nin the blood, he said it was a question scientists are trying to\nanswer. Interestingly, those who received the donor's corneas, liver,\nand heart did not develop dengue, Dr Perng said on the sidelines of\nthe National Dengue And Arboviruses Infection Conference 2017\nyesterday 12 Aug 2017. He said although there was not enough\nevidence to show the virus came from the donor as the kidneys were not\ntested for dengue before the transplant, the same virus was found in\nthe patients' bodies after that. Dr Perng said his team had studied mice for dengue virus in the blood\ntestes, kidney, liver, spleen and brain, and found the virus present\nin the kidneys and brain. \"We believe the virus probably resided in\nthe kidneys and was not cleared by the body,\" he said, adding that the\nvirus could have been activated after transplant. He said this raised\nconcerns about asymptomatic people who are dengue carriers. Health Ministry deputy director, general Datuk Dr S Jeyaindran said\npatients with severe dengue would have better recovery if they were\ngiven colloids, a more concentrated fluid, at the early stage in fluid\nmanagement for dengue patients. Dr Jeyaindran, who was representing\nHealth Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam, said colloids may be\nintroduced at an earlier stage, instead of saline because it has not\nbeen successful in treating patients with severe dengue. He said more\nstudies will be conducted to find out at which stage the colloids\nshould be given. byline: Loh Foon Fong \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) - Air travel related spread of dengue.\nDate: Thu 3 Aug 2017.\nSource: Medical Xpress (edited)\n(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-08-air-responsible-dengue-asia.html) \nWhile the incidences of many other infectious diseases have declined\nover the past decade, the number of cases and outbreaks of dengue\nvirus have continued to increase. The spread of dengue to new areas is\nlikely due in large part to trends in air travel, researchers now\nreport in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Dengue virus affects as estimated 390 million people around the globe\neach year, and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild fever and\nheadache to severe low blood pressure. The virus has mostly caused\ndisease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, but a 2014\noutbreak in Japan broke that pattern. Overall, the geographic area\naffected by dengue has been growing in recent years. In the new work, Huaiyu Tian and Bing Xu, both of Beijing Normal\nUniversity, China, together with colleagues from the University of\nOxford and elsewhere analyzed the spread of dengue viruses in Asia\nfrom 1956 to 2015. They used 2202 genetic sequences of dengue viruses,\ncollected in 20 countries or regions of Asia over the 59 years, to\ndetermine how different strains were related. They also investigated\ntrends in air travel, maritime mobility, migration, and\nsocio-economics to determine what factors impact the spread of\ndengue. The spread of 3 different dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1, -2, and -3,\nis associated with air traffic more so than any other factors, the\ndata revealed. Air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India, the\nresearchers found, help seed dengue epidemics, while China, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, and Singapore help diffuse the virus to other Asian\ncountries. \"Future trends in global mobility could potentially accelerate the\nappearance and diffusion of DENV worldwide,\" the researchers say.\n\"Prevention and control of dengue epidemics requires a better\nunderstanding of its mode of geographic dissemination, especially for\ncountries in the tropics.\" Reference: Tian H, Sun Z, Faria NR, et al.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness\nand disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE,\nAtay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral\nrehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and\nother forms of diarrhea: \"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that\ncholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement,\nand, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not\nuntil 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of\nthe intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could\nbe effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the\nintravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could\nbe just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for\nexample, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy\n(ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the\nmorbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1)\nhighlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn\nBangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per\ncent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as\n\"potentially the most important medical advance\" of the 20th century.\nA variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice\npowder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially\nzinc (5). \"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to\napproximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those\nwith severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously\nwith a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of\n20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg\nover the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser\ndegrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or\nrice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those\nwith no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with\nfrequent reevaluation. \"References\n-\n1.

On Sun 3 Sep 2017, some 59 officers were hospitalised in various\nhospitals in Nairobi with another 36 admitted Mon 4 Sep 2017, after\ncontracting the disease. They were part of a group of 430 officers\ndeployed to Nairobi ahead of the Supreme Court ruling on presidential\npoll petition on Fri 1 Sep 2017. They were residing at the\nMultimedia University Hotel in Rongai, about 17 kilometers 10.6 mi\nsouth of the capital. \"Those infected did not get the disease from the Multimedia University\nsince they had their lunch away from the institution. Investigations\nshow that the source is the Nairobi Area Police Canteen,\" said Dr\nRalph Muli, the Nairobi County head of Diseases Surveillance.\nConsequently, the City has temporarily closed the canteen. The Health Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu said the officers were in\nstable condition. Dr Mailu said investigations were underway to\nestablish whether the canteen had outsourced services to cater for the\nlarge number of officers. He said the ministry was concerned that\ninstead of eliminating cholera, new cases were emerging. Nairobi was first hit by the outbreak on 19 May 2017, with 56 cases\nhaving been reported. One of the police officers who requested anonymity said they ate ugali\n(a Kenyan staple made of maize flour) and meat stew at the canteen on\nSat 2 Sep 2017.

The\nfollowing is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In:\nChronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract.\nGreydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in\npress): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons,\nvaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside\nof Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as\n60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection\nlengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:\n- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam;\n- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however,\nhave suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be\neffective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and\noutbreak situations (63, 64). \"References\n\n57.

The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 11 Jun 2017, from Killa Abdullah, Balochistan. - Two new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) environmental positive samples were reported in the past week, from Karachi, Sindh (collected on 7 and 12 Aug 2017). - Additionally, pre-notification was received this week of a new WPV1 case from Karachi, Pakistan. The case will be officially reflected in next week's global data reporting. Karachi had previously been a key reservoir for WPV1 in Pakistan. Analysis is ongoing to determine the origin of this latest case and a response is being planned. The case had onset of paralysis on 11 Aug 2017. The last previous case from Karachi is from January 2016. - The National Task Force for Polio Eradication convened last week, chaired by the Prime Minister of Pakistan and attended by the senior leadership from the national and provincial levels. The Task force reviewed the revised National Emergency Action Plan 2017/18 and discussed mechanisms of accelerating the implementation of strategies to stop WPV1 transmission in the key hot spots. - Under the National Emergency Action Plan for polio eradication, the country is planning to implement 2 nation-wide and 2 sub-national vaccination rounds from September to December 2017.  Nigeria - - No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 21 Aug 2016 in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno. - Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and cVDPV2 strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016). - Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance.  Lake Chad Basin  - The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno, Nigeria in 2016) and cVDPV2 (Borno and Sokoto provinces in Nigeria in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak. - Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.  Central Africa  - One new case of cVDPV2 was reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), from Haut Lomami province, with onset of paralysis on 20 Jun 2017. The total number of cVDPV2 cases this year 2017 is now 8, in 2 separate outbreaks: in Haut Lomami province (6 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on 20 Jun 2017); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on 26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017, with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May 2017). - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time. Outbreak response is taking place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols, targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 across the 2 provinces. \n- The 1st mOPV2 round was implemented on 27-29 Jun 2017 in the 2 affected provinces; and the 2nd mOPV2 round ran from 13-15 Jul 2017 in Haut Lomami and 20-22 Jul 2017 in Maniema. - Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.  Middle East  - In Syria, 6 new cases of cVDPV2 were officially reported in the past week from Deir-Ez-Zour governorate, bringing the total number of cases in this outbreak to 39. Onset of paralysis of these cases is between 3 Mar 2017 and 10 Jul 2017. The bulk of all cases are from Deir-Ez-Zour, the epicentre of this outbreak. - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized and implemented, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Two vaccination campaigns are planned for both Deir-Ez-Zour and Raqqa governorates. - The 1st mOPV2 round in Deir-Ez-Zour was successfully carried out between 22-26 Jul 2017. Independent post-campaign monitoring reflected coverage of 88.4 percent (based on caregiver recall). - The 2nd immunization round for Deir-Ez-Zor governorate started on 22 Aug 2017 and is ongoing. Monovalent OPV2 is being provided for children between 0-59 months of age, and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) for children 2-23 months. In addition to polio vaccines, Aqua Tabs are being provided to families for water purification - 2.5 tons of water purification tablets for 400 000 people have been disseminated at health centers. - Plans are being finalized to mitigate the risks of further spread from the outbreak zone to neighbouring areas and countries, including immunization of at-risk populations in northwest Syria, Turkey and Lebanon.

All confirmed cases to date have had onset of paralysis before 14 Jul 2017. - Final lab results are pending for an additional 5 poliovirus type-2 (PV2) isolates (3 from Mayadeen and 1 from Boukamal districts, Deir Ez-Zor governorate, and 1 from Thawra district, Raqqa governorate). - The 2nd immunization round for Deir Ez-Zor started on 22 Aug 2017 and is ongoing due to high levels of population movement in and out of the governorate during the round. - WHO has organized the redistribution of vaccines and mapping of population movements to increase reach. An additional 90 000 mOPV2 doses are being transported from Damascus to Deir Ez-Zor, to cater for population influxes from As-Sukhnah, Homs governorate, and Al-Qa'im in Iraq. Corrective measures are expected to extend the round by 2 days. - Preparations for the 2nd immunization round for Raqqa are underway. - The total number of AFP cases detected in Deir Ez-Zor governorate since the beginning of 2017 is 122 (91 from Mayadeen, 10 from Deir Ez-Zor, and 21 from Boukamal districts). Raqqa governorate has reported 16 AFP cases (5 from Raqqa, 10 from Tell Abyad, and 1 from Thawra districts). Homs governorate has reported 28 AFP cases (12 from Homs city, 13 from Rastan, 1 from Tadmour and 2 from Talkalakh districts).  more details on the vaccination activities and future plans are available at the source URL as well as the epidemic curve and graphic representation of the vaccination status of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis cases by governorate and district. - Mod.MPP   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  In the above global summary, there is still identified transmission ongoing in Pakistan as seen by the positive environmental sample in Karachi as well as the early report on a case of WPV1 associated disease in Karachi. It will be interesting to learn of the genetic profile of the environmental isolates in Karachi (from this past week as well as from a few weeks ago) and compare them with the newly identified WPV1 associated case in Karachi to see if they are genetically related.  There has been more activity associated with cVDPV2 in both Syria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), with 6 newly confirmed cases in Syria and 1 newly confirmed case in the DR Congo. According to the Situation Report in section <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> above, there are still 5 additional PV2 (poliovirus type 2) isolates in Syria undergoing final testing  4 from Deir al Zour and 1 from Raqqa. Hence there will probably be more cases confirmed in the coming days or weeks. I have not been able to identify similar report information from the DR Congo outbreak so it is not clear if the transmission has been interrupted leaving a total of 8 cases, or if there are still probable cases pending confirmation.

All 4 dengue serotypes are\npresent this year 2017. A total of 15 samples found to be\nco-infected. In an earlier study done in New Delhi, such multiple\ndengue serotype infections were reported in only 19 per cent of cases.\nAll 4 dengue serotypes were detected in almost equal number in blood\nsamples, unlike in an earlier study conducted in New Delhi wherein one\nserotype was found to be dominating. This has been indicated as a\npossible reason for the high prevalence of infection due to more than\none dengue serotype. Another finding of concern is that DEN-4 strain,\nresembling the one detected in Pune in 2009, was detected in as many\nas 11 samples. DEN-4 is associated with unusual symptoms like\nrespiratory distress, pleural effusion, and elevated levels of liver\nenzymes.

This came about after 2\nkidney recipients in Taiwan were diagnosed with dengue 2 days after\nreceiving a kidney each from the same donor, said National Cheng Kung\nUniversity microbiology and immunology professor Dr Oscar Perng\nGuey-chuen. \"This indicates a potential risk,\" the Taiwan-based\nscientist said, adding that no dengue virus was detected in the\ndonor's blood. He said the donor contracted dengue in 2015 and in mid-2016, he died\nin an accident. His family donated his corneas, liver, heart, and\nkidneys. Both patients had the same strain of the dengue virus the\ndonor had in 2015 and one of the recipients died of dengue\nhaemorrhagic fever, he said. Asked where the virus could be hiding since it could not be detected\nin the blood, he said it was a question scientists are trying to\nanswer. Interestingly, those who received the donor's corneas, liver,\nand heart did not develop dengue, Dr Perng said on the sidelines of\nthe National Dengue And Arboviruses Infection Conference 2017\nyesterday 12 Aug 2017. He said although there was not enough\nevidence to show the virus came from the donor as the kidneys were not\ntested for dengue before the transplant, the same virus was found in\nthe patients' bodies after that. Dr Perng said his team had studied mice for dengue virus in the blood\ntestes, kidney, liver, spleen and brain, and found the virus present\nin the kidneys and brain. \"We believe the virus probably resided in\nthe kidneys and was not cleared by the body,\" he said, adding that the\nvirus could have been activated after transplant. He said this raised\nconcerns about asymptomatic people who are dengue carriers. Health Ministry deputy director, general Datuk Dr S Jeyaindran said\npatients with severe dengue would have better recovery if they were\ngiven colloids, a more concentrated fluid, at the early stage in fluid\nmanagement for dengue patients. Dr Jeyaindran, who was representing\nHealth Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam, said colloids may be\nintroduced at an earlier stage, instead of saline because it has not\nbeen successful in treating patients with severe dengue. He said more\nstudies will be conducted to find out at which stage the colloids\nshould be given. byline: Loh Foon Fong \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) - Air travel related spread of dengue.\nDate: Thu 3 Aug 2017.\nSource: Medical Xpress (edited)\n(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-08-air-responsible-dengue-asia.html) \nWhile the incidences of many other infectious diseases have declined\nover the past decade, the number of cases and outbreaks of dengue\nvirus have continued to increase. The spread of dengue to new areas is\nlikely due in large part to trends in air travel, researchers now\nreport in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Dengue virus affects as estimated 390 million people around the globe\neach year, and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild fever and\nheadache to severe low blood pressure. The virus has mostly caused\ndisease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, but a 2014\noutbreak in Japan broke that pattern. Overall, the geographic area\naffected by dengue has been growing in recent years. In the new work, Huaiyu Tian and Bing Xu, both of Beijing Normal\nUniversity, China, together with colleagues from the University of\nOxford and elsewhere analyzed the spread of dengue viruses in Asia\nfrom 1956 to 2015. They used 2202 genetic sequences of dengue viruses,\ncollected in 20 countries or regions of Asia over the 59 years, to\ndetermine how different strains were related. They also investigated\ntrends in air travel, maritime mobility, migration, and\nsocio-economics to determine what factors impact the spread of\ndengue. The spread of 3 different dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1, -2, and -3,\nis associated with air traffic more so than any other factors, the\ndata revealed. Air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India, the\nresearchers found, help seed dengue epidemics, while China, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, and Singapore help diffuse the virus to other Asian\ncountries. \"Future trends in global mobility could potentially accelerate the\nappearance and diffusion of DENV worldwide,\" the researchers say.\n\"Prevention and control of dengue epidemics requires a better\nunderstanding of its mode of geographic dissemination, especially for\ncountries in the tropics.\" Reference: Tian H, Sun Z, Faria NR, et al.

The\nfollowing is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In:\nChronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract.\nGreydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in\npress): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons,\nvaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside\nof Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as\n60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection\nlengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:\n- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam;\n- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however,\nhave suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be\neffective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and\noutbreak situations (63, 64). \"References\n\n57.

This came about after 2\nkidney recipients in Taiwan were diagnosed with dengue 2 days after\nreceiving a kidney each from the same donor, said National Cheng Kung\nUniversity microbiology and immunology professor Dr Oscar Perng\nGuey-chuen. \"This indicates a potential risk,\" the Taiwan-based\nscientist said, adding that no dengue virus was detected in the\ndonor's blood. He said the donor contracted dengue in 2015 and in mid-2016, he died\nin an accident. His family donated his corneas, liver, heart, and\nkidneys. Both patients had the same strain of the dengue virus the\ndonor had in 2015 and one of the recipients died of dengue\nhaemorrhagic fever, he said. Asked where the virus could be hiding since it could not be detected\nin the blood, he said it was a question scientists are trying to\nanswer. Interestingly, those who received the donor's corneas, liver,\nand heart did not develop dengue, Dr Perng said on the sidelines of\nthe National Dengue And Arboviruses Infection Conference 2017\nyesterday 12 Aug 2017. He said although there was not enough\nevidence to show the virus came from the donor as the kidneys were not\ntested for dengue before the transplant, the same virus was found in\nthe patients' bodies after that. Dr Perng said his team had studied mice for dengue virus in the blood\ntestes, kidney, liver, spleen and brain, and found the virus present\nin the kidneys and brain. \"We believe the virus probably resided in\nthe kidneys and was not cleared by the body,\" he said, adding that the\nvirus could have been activated after transplant. He said this raised\nconcerns about asymptomatic people who are dengue carriers. Health Ministry deputy director, general Datuk Dr S Jeyaindran said\npatients with severe dengue would have better recovery if they were\ngiven colloids, a more concentrated fluid, at the early stage in fluid\nmanagement for dengue patients. Dr Jeyaindran, who was representing\nHealth Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam, said colloids may be\nintroduced at an earlier stage, instead of saline because it has not\nbeen successful in treating patients with severe dengue. He said more\nstudies will be conducted to find out at which stage the colloids\nshould be given. byline: Loh Foon Fong \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) - Air travel related spread of dengue.\nDate: Thu 3 Aug 2017.\nSource: Medical Xpress (edited)\n(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-08-air-responsible-dengue-asia.html) \nWhile the incidences of many other infectious diseases have declined\nover the past decade, the number of cases and outbreaks of dengue\nvirus have continued to increase. The spread of dengue to new areas is\nlikely due in large part to trends in air travel, researchers now\nreport in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Dengue virus affects as estimated 390 million people around the globe\neach year, and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild fever and\nheadache to severe low blood pressure. The virus has mostly caused\ndisease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, but a 2014\noutbreak in Japan broke that pattern. Overall, the geographic area\naffected by dengue has been growing in recent years. In the new work, Huaiyu Tian and Bing Xu, both of Beijing Normal\nUniversity, China, together with colleagues from the University of\nOxford and elsewhere analyzed the spread of dengue viruses in Asia\nfrom 1956 to 2015. They used 2202 genetic sequences of dengue viruses,\ncollected in 20 countries or regions of Asia over the 59 years, to\ndetermine how different strains were related. They also investigated\ntrends in air travel, maritime mobility, migration, and\nsocio-economics to determine what factors impact the spread of\ndengue. The spread of 3 different dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1, -2, and -3,\nis associated with air traffic more so than any other factors, the\ndata revealed. Air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India, the\nresearchers found, help seed dengue epidemics, while China, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, and Singapore help diffuse the virus to other Asian\ncountries. \"Future trends in global mobility could potentially accelerate the\nappearance and diffusion of DENV worldwide,\" the researchers say.\n\"Prevention and control of dengue epidemics requires a better\nunderstanding of its mode of geographic dissemination, especially for\ncountries in the tropics.\" Reference: Tian H, Sun Z, Faria NR, et al.

Department of Disease Control (DDC) chief Dr Jessada Chokdamrongsuk reported on Mon 28 Aug 2017, that 1978 cases of melioidosis had been reported from 1 Jan 2017 to 22 Aug 2017.  The disease, caused by the bacterium _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ and prevalent during the rainy season in the subtropics, peaks every August in Thailand and has been wider spread this year 2017, he said. \"The bacterium thrives in contaminated water and soil and infects humans and animals through direct contact. People could get infected from prolonged exposure to contaminated water or soil, especially if they have any open sores or lesions in the skin,\" Jessada said. \"Infection can also come from consuming contaminated water or food.\"  Melioidosis produces a variety of acute and severe symptoms, he said, including long-lasting fever with no other apparent cause, ulcers or abscesses in the lungs, liver or spleen, and blood infections. The disease, which mainly affects adults, can be fatal, he said. Death has been known to result within 2-3 days of admission to hospital.  Risk factors for infection include chronic respiratory and lung disease, tuberculosis, diabetes, chronic renal disease, thalassemia, cancer, and immune-suppressing conditions unrelated to HIV. Jessada advised people coming into regular contact with floodwater to wear boots, drink only water that has been boiled, avoid raw and partially cooked food, wash immediately after exposure and seek medical attention if a fever persists for more than 5 days or abscesses become chronic.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  Melioidosis is a disease of the rainy season in its endemic areas. It mainly affects people who have direct contact with soil and water. Many have an underlying predisposing condition such as diabetes (commonest risk factor), renal disease, cirrhosis, thalassemia, alcohol dependence, immunosuppressive therapy, chronic obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and excess kava consumption. Kava is an herbal member of the pepper family that can be associated with chronic liver disease.  Melioidosis may present at any age, but peaks in the 4th and 5th decades of life, affecting men more than women. In addition, although severe fulminating infection can and does occur in healthy individuals, severe disease and fatalities are much less common in those without risk factors.  The most commonly recognized presentation of melioidosis is pneumonia, associated with high fever, significant muscle aches, chest pain, and  although the cough can be nonproductive  respiratory secretions can be purulent, significant in quantity, and associated with on-and-off bright, red blood. The lung infection can be rapidly fatal  with bacteremia and shock  or somewhat more indolent.  Acute melioidosis septicemia is the most severe complication of the infection. It presents as a typical sepsis syndrome with hypotension, high cardiac output, and low systemic vascular resistance. In many cases, a primary focus in the soft tissues or lung can be found. The syndrome, usually in patients with risk factor comorbidities, is characteristically associated with multiple abscesses involving the cutaneous tissues, the lung, the liver, and spleen, and a very high mortality rate of 80 to 95 percent. With prompt optimal therapy, the case fatality rate can be decreased to 40 to 50 percent.  The melioidosis bacillus is intrinsically insensitive to many antimicrobials. It should be noted that bioterrorism strains may be engineered to be even more resistant. _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ is usually inhibited by tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT), antipseudomonal penicillins, carbapenems, ceftazidime, and amoxicillin/clavulanate or ampicillin/sulbactam. Ceftriaxone and cefotaxime have good in vitro activity but poor efficacy; and cefepime did not appear, as well, to be equivalent to ceftazidime in a mouse model. The unusual antimicrobial profile of resistance to colistin and polymyxin B and the aminoglycosides but sensitivity to amoxicillin/clavulanate is a useful tool to consider in treatment of infection with the organism.  The randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing melioidosis treatment have been reviewed, and it was found that the formerly standard therapy of chloramphenicol, doxycycline, and SXT combination had a higher mortality rate than therapy with ceftazidime, imipenem/cilastatin, or amoxicillin/clavulanate (or ampicillin/sulbactam). The betalactam-betalactamase inhibitor therapy, however, seemed to have a higher failure rate. . Source: Tolaney P, Lutwick LI: Melioidosis. In: Lutwick LI, Lutwick SM (eds).

On 20 Aug 2017, the ministry received blood samples of 2 patients from Kiboga and Nakaseke hospital suspected Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF).  According to a 21 Aug 2017 statement signed by the acting Director General, health services Dr Anthony Mbonye, the 2 victims tested positive to Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever CCFH.  CCHF is a common disease among humans and animals caused by caused by a tick-borne virus (_Nairovirus_); the virus causes severe viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 percent.  Dr Mbonye says that the general supportive care with treatment of symptoms is the main approach to managing CCFH among humans. The statement warns that while its symptoms do not appear in the infected animal, it appears in a very dangerous way in human beings.  \"You are required to work with the office of the District Veterinary Officer to strengthen measures against CCHF control in animals, implement interventions to reduce the risk of CCHF infections among humans, and interventions to control CCFH in health care settings.  You are also reminded to immediately report and investigate any CCFH suspected cases in your district,\" reads the statement in part signed by Dr Mbonye.  CCHF virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter.  According to Ministry of health, the majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians and that human-to-human transmission occurs from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of infected persons.  Hospital-acquired infections can also occur due to improper sterilization of medical equipment, reuse of needles, and contamination of medical supplies.  Records indicate that since 2000, Uganda has experienced repeated outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF). Ebola VHF outbreak occurred in the districts of Gulu in 2000, Bundibugyo, 2007, Luwero, 2011, Kibaale in July 2012, Luwero in November 2012. Marburg VHF was earlier reported in Ibanda in 2007. More recently in 2012, 2 outbreaks of Marburg VHF have occurred in Ibanda and Kabale districts.  Signs and symptoms of CCHF  Sudden, with fever, myalgia, (muscle ache), dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes and photophobia (sensitivity to light), nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and sore throat early on, followed by sharp mood swings and confusion.  After 2 to 4 days, the agitation may be replaced by sleepiness, depression, and lassitude, and the abdominal pain may localize to the upper right quadrant, with detectable hepatomegaly (liver enlargement).

(promed@promedmail.org)  CCHF is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and Asian countries south of the 50th parallel north  the geographical limit of the principal tick vector. The hosts of the CCHF virus include a wide range of wild and domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats.  Animals become infected by the bite of infected ticks and the virus remains in their bloodstream for about one week after infection, allowing the tick-animal-tick cycle to continue when another tick bites. Although a number of tick genera are capable of becoming infected with CCHF virus, ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_ are the principal vector. The CCHF virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Human-to-human transmission is possible.

They were residing at the\nMultimedia University Hotel in Rongai, about 17 kilometers 10.6 mi\nsouth of the capital. \"Those infected did not get the disease from the Multimedia University\nsince they had their lunch away from the institution. Investigations\nshow that the source is the Nairobi Area Police Canteen,\" said Dr\nRalph Muli, the Nairobi County head of Diseases Surveillance.\nConsequently, the City has temporarily closed the canteen. The Health Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu said the officers were in\nstable condition. Dr Mailu said investigations were underway to\nestablish whether the canteen had outsourced services to cater for the\nlarge number of officers. He said the ministry was concerned that\ninstead of eliminating cholera, new cases were emerging. Nairobi was first hit by the outbreak on 19 May 2017, with 56 cases\nhaving been reported. One of the police officers who requested anonymity said they ate ugali\n(a Kenyan staple made of maize flour) and meat stew at the canteen on\nSat 2 Sep 2017. He said he started feeling sick in the evening.

Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:\n- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam;\n- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit.

This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses.

Eight cases, including 2 deaths have been reported from Nakaseke and Kiboga districts as of 28 Aug 2017.  The Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries, and CDC deployed a multi-disciplinary rapid response team to the 2 districts to conduct outbreak investigation and rapid risk assessment. The epidemiology team is in the field to investigate the source of the outbreak and conduct contact tracing.  CCHF is known to be endemic in Uganda, especially in the cattle corridor, which is a strip of land spanning across 18 districts, from the southwest to the northeast of the country. Smaller intermittent outbreaks have been reported in the past. The last outbreak occurred in August 2013, during which 6 cases were reported.  The simultaneous occurrence of the current outbreak in 2 neighboring districts may be indicative of a larger burden of the disease than expected. The current drought in some parts of the country could heighten the risk of the disease spreading to other areas as a result of livestock movement in search of pasture and water.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  The current report indicates that at least 2 adjacent districts have reported CCHF cases, located mainly in cattle raising areas. It is important to reach out with public health education focusing on several aspects, including use of protective clothing such as long sleeves and trousers. People should be advised to wear light coloured clothes during a visit to the animal market to allow easy detection of ticks, and to regularly examine clothing and skin for ticks, and, if found, removing them safely, and using approved repellents on clothing and skin. Furthermore, studies may be planned to map the distribution of the tick species, particularly in the cattle belt region. - Mod.UBA  A map showing the districts of Uganda can be found at: (http://guidetouganda.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/UgandaBig.jpg).- Mod.MPP  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/97).

The total amount of dead wild boars discovered in the woods around\nZlín, in the far east of the Czech Republic, stood at 94 at the end\nof August 2017. In this month, 23 new infected carcasses were found,\nwhich is a downward trend from July 2017, when 68 reports were sent\nto the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). The 1st report of\nASF in Czech wild boars was on Wed 21 Jun 2017. Many neighbouring countries have alerted their local pig producers to\nbe very careful what to feed their pigs - and their inhabitants what\nto purchase and how to dispose of it. So did Slovakia, according to\nthe Slovak Spectator. Zlín is only a few km away from the western\nSlovak border, to its north is Poland where ASF has been around since\n2014 and on its eastern border is Ukraine, where ASF has been\nconfirmed since 2011. In a presentation, given in mid-July 2017 to the European\nCommission's Standing Committee On Animals, Plants, Food and Feed\n(SCoPAFF), Dr Petr Šatrán of the Czech State Veterinary\nAdministration indicated that human activities are most likely the\ncause of the spread of the virus, seeing that the nearest reported\ncases of ASF were roughly 500 km 310.68 mi away and that the\npositive dead wild boars were found in inhabited areas. In the other country where ASF was found for the 1st time in 2017,\nRomania, things appear relatively quiet. News broke early this month\nAugust 2017 that ASF was also found on 2 backyard farms in the north\nof the country. Ever since, the Romanian authorities did not report\nany further outbreaks of ASF to the OIE. Of all other countries in the European Union, especially Poland has\ncontinued to report outbreaks of African Swine Fever in smaller and\nmiddle-sized operations. In August alone, on 23 farm sites of various\nsizes, ASF was found to have infected at least one animal, after which\nthe entire herd would have to be culled. The biggest operation in this respect was a farm near Monki, Podlaskie\nprovince, where all remaining 431 pigs had to be culled after 11 had\ndied as a result of ASF, on Sat 19 Aug 2017. Noteworthy as well was\nthe ASF-related closure of 2 farms in Lack, Lubelskie province, in\nearly August. These farms had 136 and 141 pigs respectively see also\nitem 2.

This was said by Poland's Minister of Agriculture,\nKrzysztof Yurgel, Niezalezna reports. As reported, the length of the fence will be 729 km 452.98 mi,\ncosting Poland 130 million zloties (more than 36.2 million USD). The\nfinal decision on a fence will be made within the next 3 weeks. According to experts, ASF has developed in the territory of Poland\n\"thanks to\" the wild boars who entered from Belarus. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) The accumulated ASF OIE data from Poland as of Thu 31 Aug 2017, are\nas follows (start of event 22 May 2014):\nNumber of follow-up reports: 189\nTotal outbreaks: 550 (Submitted)\nSpecies/ Susceptible/ Cases/ Deaths/ Killed and disposed of/\nSlaughtered\nWild boar/ - / 620 / 620 / 0 / 0\nDomestic Swine/ 6303/ 402/ 188/ 6097/ 0 A map showing ASF cases reported globally to the OIE since 1 Jan 2017,\nas of Thu 31 Aug 2017, is available at (http://tinyurl.com/ybexasqm).\nClick on the European cluster, zoom in to each of the countries of\ninterest. EU disease control measures require designation of risk areas as Part\nI (wild boar at risk, but no cases found), Part II (wild boar testing\npositive but no spill over into domestic pigs), Part III (cases in\nwild boar and occasional spill over into domestic pigs) and Part IV\nwhich concerns the island of Sardinia only. Consignments of live pigs,\nlive wild boars, meat of either source and animal by-products of\neither source are only allowed under certain derogations. For a full\nexplanation, see European Commission Implementing Decision\n2014/708/EU. ASF, a viral disease against which no vaccine has become available so\nfar, is currently threatening central and western Europe, where dense\npopulations of wild boar are present. According to a recent update of DEFRA (UK) ASF situation assessment,\nthe continuing cases in the Czech Republic, the spread in Poland which\nappears to be due to several breakdowns in biosecurity and the new\noutbreaks in Romania are \"concerning\". This signifies a spread in\ngeographic distribution, a possible drop in biosecurity awareness and\ntherefore an increase in the weight of infection in East Europe. Despite the relatively low level of trade in live pigs, there could be\na substantial movement of people, vehicles and personal imports of\npork products, therefore the risk of ASF introduction to the UK has\nbeen raised from \"very low\" (that is, \"rare but could occur\") to\n\"low\". The Russian veterinary watchdog Rosselkhoznadzor believes ASF will\nkeep moving west via 2 main pathways. The southerly route, has already\nseen the virus spread from Ukraine to Moldova.

Clearly\ntransmission is continuing in this area, with 3 newly confirmed\nsecondary cases in household contacts - at least 2 of whom were\nidentified through screening of asymptomatic household contacts, and 2\nadditional cases in which high risk exposures are still under\ninvestigation. We do not know if these household contacts are\nassociated with the earlier identified transmission chain in Dawmat\nAljandal or if these are newly identified chains of transmission. The\nother 2 newly confirmed cases involve \"sporadic\" cases - an individual\nin Hail whose high risk exposure history is still under investigation,\nand an individual from Alaflaj (Riyadh region) with a history of\ndirect contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. As to be expected, concern is being voiced on the international level\nwith the upcoming Hajj and this recent increase in cases reported both\nin Saudi Arabia and in the UAE. We now have gone through 5 Hajj\nperiods since the identification of the MERS-CoV and to date there\nhave been no cases of MERS-CoV infection identified in returning\nHajjis. The case in the UAE (see section <br><br><strong>{1}</strong> above) actually had onset\nof illness over 1 month ago with no secondary cases/infections\nidentified among known contacts of this case. As for the cases in\nSaudi Arabia, and more specifically the Hajj, population movement is\nvery well defined during the Hajj, no camels are permitted in the\nareas where Hajjis are congregated, and there are Hajj specific health\nservices that are separate from those that are available for the\ngeneral Saudi population, all factors that are reducing the likelihood\nof Hajjis having inadvertent (or intentional) high risk exposures.\nHopefully my optimism is well placed and we will pass through a 6th\nHajj period without impact on international transmission of the\nMERS-CoV associated with this Hajj.

Source: The Horse (edited) (http://www.thehorse.com/articles/39611/equine-infectious-anemia-found-in-north-carolina-mule)   A 14 year old female mule in Johnston county, North Carolina, has tested positive for equine infectious anemia (EIA). The disease was discovered during a routine blood test by the North Carolina Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, in Raleigh, and confirmed by the USDA United States Department of Agriculture. This is the 1st new case of EIA documented in North Carolina since 2005.  \"The Johnston County facility is under a quarantine order that restricts movement of equines until further testing is completed by the NC Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services,\" said Michael Neault, DVM, director of livestock and animal health programs. \"Because the disease is not curable, the affected mule has been euthanized. The remaining equines at the facility were tested and were negative for EIA. They will be observed and retested in 60 days, and we are monitoring neighboring facilities for the disease.\"  Equine infectious anemia is an incurable disease most commonly spread between equids  such as horses, mules, and donkeys  in close proximity to biting flies and ticks. Clinical signs of EIA include fever, weakness, weight loss, anemia, edema, and death; however, not all affected equids show clinical signs. All infected equids, including those that are asymptomatic, are carriers of the disease.  There are typically a small number of EIA cases in the United States every year, although the disease is common in other parts of the world. The disease is controlled in the United States by regular testing before traveling across state lines, exhibition, and other events. A Coggins test screens horses' blood for antibodies that are indicative of the presence of EIA.  There is no approved vaccine for EIA in the United States. To help prevent infection, owners can: - use sterile, disposable needles and syringes, one per horse, for all vaccines and medications; - test all horses for EIA every year, and at the time they enter a new premises; - keep stables and other facilities sanitary. Regularly clean stalls and properly dispose of manure away from horse stabling areas; - implement approved insect controls, such as insecticides and good drainage of standing water, to minimize fly presence; - only participate in events that require evidence of negative Coggins test for every equine entering the event to prevent disease introduction and spread; - isolate new horses on a property until they are tested for EIA; - never mix infected and healthy animals. Do not breed horses infected with EIA; and - follow state laws covering EIA.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  How sad that this disease continues and there is no vaccine for it. We pour millions into other research projects, some of which seem to have little value, but why no vaccine?  \"Under natural conditions, the most important mode of transmission of equine infectious anemia (EIA) is by the transfer of virus-infective blood by blood-feeding insects between horses in close proximity. Virus is found free in the plasma or cell associated, principally in monocytes and macrophages of infected animals. Although infection is considered primarily blood borne, all tissues and body fluids are potentially infectious, especially during episodes of clinical disease when viral burdens are high. Transmission of EIA by biting flies is purely mechanical; the virus does not replicate in the vector. The chance of transmission of EIA is directly proportional to the volume of blood retained on the mouthparts of the insect after feeding. In that respect, horse flies, deer flies, and to a lesser extent, stable flies are likely the most efficient vectors. It is also because they are capable of triggering host defensive behavior that interrupts feeding and results in their seeking a new susceptible host to complete their blood meal.\"  Fly control is very important, in the barn and on the animal.  Currently there is no vaccine for EIA in the US. There is a vaccine developed in China and used in other places (see Equine infectious anemia - USA (04): (KY) unlicensed vaccine http://promedmail.org/post/20150915.3645562).

Mod.JG, edited (https://goo.gl/8k5UZP)   Last weekend, more than 20 children with severe respiratory symptoms were admitted to the Regional Hospital, and they were diagnosed with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection.  During the last week, 2 3-year-old children with severe respiratory illness were admitted to the intensive care unit, and one of them was waiting to be referred to Puerto Montt.  Therefore, with information updated until last Sat 26 Aug 2017, more than 30 children with RSV infection have been reported, and all of them are hospitalized in pediatrics, pediatric intensive care, and neonatal intensive care units. Meanwhile, because of the severity of their condition  most of them being infants  7 children have been referred to hospitals in Santiago and Concepcion so they may receive adequate care, since Coyhaique Regional Hospital (CRH) does not have a pediatric intensive care unit (ICU).  This is what Dr. Jaime Lopez-Quintana, Head of the CRH reported: \"This year 2017, RSV is behaving quite aggressively, and our adult intensive care unit is completely full with children. This is not an adequate condition for taking care of these children; this is not what our children in this region deserve,\" as he reported this situation to Ms. Gisela Alarcon-Rojas, Subsecretary of Healthcare Networks of the Chilean Ministry of Health, who verified the condition of children being taken care of in the (adult) ICU.  So, with this complex situation, Dr. Lopez-Quintana added that specialists from important children referral centers, particularly from Dr. Luis Calvo-Mackenna and Dr. Exequiel Fernandez-Cortes hospitals, will soon arrive to this region. \"We hope to have for the next 2 weeks the support of pediatricians trained in intensive medicine who may help the team we have here in Coyhaique,\" emphasized Dr. Lopez-Quintana.  According to information brought by the medical sub-direction from the Coyhaique Regional Hospital, the affected children are hospitalized in the following areas: pediatrics, neonatal intensive care unit, and (general) intensive care unit.  There are 10 infants hospitalized in the pediatrics service, while another 11 children have already been discharged; so now there are 14 beds available. In the neonatal ICU, 7 children are hospitalized; 2 of them are severely ill, and the capacity of the unit is 2 beds; while in the general ICU, 6 infants are hospitalized, and there are 2 beds available.  \"With respect to bed availability, the hospital is still able to cope with the situation. However, a working overload for the personnel has been observed, so that extra personnel have been recruited to cover the work shifts,\" explained Dr. Joaquin Garcia-Gay, Medical Subdirector of the CRH.  Also, Dr. Garcia-Gay explained that if a child develops a febrile illness, respiratory distress, intercostal retraction and malaise for 2 days, these are some of the symptoms that may indicate the presence of RSV, which mainly affects infants less than 2 years old.  \"So, if such symptoms occur, then the child must be brought to the Urgency Service. However, for those patients that develop mild respiratory symptoms, such as common cold or other similar conditions, it is preferable they are not brought to the Urgency Service, since they may be at risk for becoming infected with RSV from patients that are being hospitalized,\" the specialist advised.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  RSV is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections among young children worldwide. Most infants are infected before one year of age, and virtually everyone gets an RSV infection by 2 years of age.  Each year, on average, in the United States, RSV leads to: - 57 527 hospitalizations among children younger than 5 years old - 2.1 million outpatient visits among children younger than 5 years old - 177 000 hospitalizations and 14 000 deaths among adults older than 65 years.  In the United States and other areas with similar climates, RSV infections occur primarily during fall, winter, and spring (https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/research/us-surveillance.html). It is currently winter in Chile.  It is not clear what may have led to this current RSV outbreak in Chile. In 2001, an outbreak of RSV struck Santiago, Chile. 150 hospital admissions were registered daily during the height of the southern hemisphere winter. It was speculated that pollution may have played a role as Santiago is one of the world's most polluted cities. Chile's geography of surrounding mountains and heat inversions in winter dramatically increases the concentration of pollutants. Pollution leads to irritation of the respiratory tract making it more difficult for the immune system to respond to infections. (Excerpted from C Orellana.

Illnesses started on dates ranging from 1 Mar 2017 to 3 Aug 2017. Of 33 people with available information, 16 have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. 12 (32 percent) ill people are children 5 years of age or younger.

In interviews, ill people answered questions about contact with animals during the week before becoming ill. 15 (45 percent) of the 33 people interviewed reported contact with turtles or their environments, such as water from a turtle habitat, before getting sick. In interviews with 9 ill people about where their turtles came from, 6 reported buying a turtle from a flea market or street vendor, or receiving the turtle as a gift.  In 2015, state and local health officials collected samples from turtles at a street vendor. Whole genome sequencing showed that the _Salmonella_ Agbeni isolated from ill people in this outbreak is closely related genetically to the _S._ Agbeni isolates from turtles. This close genetic relationship means that people in this outbreak are more likely to share a common source of infection.  Do not buy small turtles as pets or give them as gifts. Since 1975, the FDA has banned selling and distributing turtles with shells less than 4 inches long as pets because they are often linked to _Salmonella_ infections, especially in young children. All turtles, regardless of size, can carry _Salmonella_ bacteria even if they look healthy and clean. These outbreaks are a reminder to follow simple steps to enjoy pet reptiles and keep your family healthy.  This outbreak is expected to continue since consumers might be unaware of the risk of _Salmonella_ infection from small turtles. If properly cared for, turtles have a long life expectancy.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  In 2008, CDC reported on an ongoing outbreak of _S._ Paratyphi B var. Java (CDC: _Salmonella_ Infections Associated with Exposure to Turtles  USA, 2007-2008. Morbid Mortal Weekly Rep 2008; 57(03): 69-72; (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5703a3.htm). Some of the discussion of the report is reproduced below:  \"The prohibition on the sale and distribution of small turtles was enacted in 1975, after public health investigations demonstrated that small turtles were a major source of human _Salmonella_ infections, particularly in children. In 1972, a study in New Jersey indicated that small pet turtles accounted for approximately 23 percent of _Salmonella_ infections in children (4). In 1980, the 1975 prohibition was estimated to have prevented 100 000 _Salmonella_ infections in American children each year since going into effect (5). However, this prohibition has an exception: small turtles may be sold legally for scientific, educational, or exhibition purposes. During 2001-2006, the number of turtles kept as pets in the USA increased 86 percent to nearly 2 million turtles (6), suggesting that this exception might provide a mechanism by which small turtles become household pets.  \"Turtles, like other reptiles, commonly carry _Salmonella_, and fecal carriage rates can be as high as 90 percent (1). Small turtles sold as pets frequently come from breeding farms, where turtles are housed in crowded ponds and nesting areas in a way that promotes _Salmonella_ transmission (7). Attempts to treat turtles, turtle eggs, and turtle breeding ponds with antibiotics to eliminate _Salmonella_ have not been successful and have resulted in a high prevalence of antibiotic resistance (7,8). Other treatments reduce but do not eliminate shedding from turtles (8), and the turtles that continue to shed might recontaminate other turtles during rearing or shipment. Because shedding might be intermittent and stress related, determining whether turtles are free of the bacteria is difficult (1).  \"Direct or indirect contact with a reptile is associated with an estimated 6 percent of human salmonellosis in the USA (9). Persons coming into contact with reptiles, reptile habitats, or surfaces contaminated with reptile fecal matter risk infection from salmonellae shed by the reptile (10). Although most reptiles carry _Salmonella_, small turtles are likely to be handled differently than other reptiles and thus carry a greater risk of transmitting _Salmonella_ to children. In contrast to the obvious risk for a bite or scratch, for example, from a snake or an iguana, a small turtle is likely to be perceived as safe, and thus might be given directly to small children to play with. In addition, a young child placed in charge of caring for a turtle has direct contact with water in the turtle habitat, where salmonellae are likely to multiply to high numbers. Although approximately half of the infections associated with this outbreak occurred in young children, who are at greater risk for severe illness from salmonellosis (2,10), several illnesses occurred in adults with turtle exposure, demonstrating that turtle-associated salmonellosis is not unique to children. Additionally, only 20 percent of case-patients interviewed reported awareness of the link between salmonellosis and contact with reptiles, indicating that measures to educate the public about this link have not been successful. CDC has provided recommendations to prevent reptile-associated salmonellosis in humans (2). However, because of the particular hazard associated with small turtles, prohibiting the sale and distribution of small turtles likely remains the most effective public health action to prevent turtle-associated salmonellosis.

The recent outbreaks of ZIKV in Brazil and French\nPolynesia have been linked to a considerable increase in the incidence\nof fetal microcephaly and other diseases such as Guillain-Barre\nsyndrome. Because there is currently no specific therapy or vaccine,\nthe early exploitation of a method to prevent expansion of ZIKV is a\nhigh priority. To validate commonly used antiviral drugs, we evaluated\nthe effect of ribavirin, a drug used to treat hepatitis C with\ninterferon-beta (IFN-beta), on ZIKV replication. In mammalian cells,\nwe observed an inhibitory effect of ribavirin on ZIKV replication and\nZIKV-induced cell death without cytotoxic effect. Furthermore, we\nfound that STAT1-deficient mice, which lack type I IFN signaling, were\nhighly sensitive to ZIKV infection and exhibited lethal outcome.\nRibavirin abrogated viremia in ZIKV-infected STAT-1-deficient mice.\nThese data suggest that the inhibition of viral RNA-dependent RNA\npolymerases may be effective for treatment of ZIKV infection. Our data\nprovide a new insight into the mechanisms for inhibition of ZIKV\nreplication and prevention of Zika fever. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) It will be interesting to see if these encouraging results showing\ninhibition of Zika virus replication can be replicated in non-human\nprimates. The challenge for use of drugs to inhibit Zika virus\ninfection in humans is that most (around 80 percent) Zika virus\ninfections are asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms. These\nindividuals will probably not seek medical treatment, even though\ntheir fetuses are at risk of infection with teratogenic effects. -\nMod.TY \n<br><br><strong>{3}</strong> Zika virus skewed immunosuppression.\nDate: Mon 21 Aug 2017.\nSource: Nature Microbiology journal (edited)\n(http://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-017-0016-3) \nref: Foo SS, Chen W, Chan Y, et al. Asian Zika virus strains target\nCD14+ blood monocytes and induce M2-skewed immunosuppression during\npregnancy. Nat Microbiol. 2017. doi: 10.1038/s41564-017-0016-3\n-\nAbstract\nBlood CD14+ monocytes are frontline immunomodulators categorized into\nclassical, intermediate or non-classical subsets, and subsequently\ndifferentiated into M1 pro- or M2 anti-inflammatory macrophages on\nstimulation. Although the Zika virus (ZIKV) rapidly establishes\nviraemia, the target cells and immune responses, particularly during\npregnancy, remain elusive. Furthermore, it is unknown whether African-\nand Asian-lineage ZIKV have different phenotypic impacts on host\nimmune responses. Using human blood infection, we identified CD14+\nmonocytes as the primary target for African- or Asian-lineage ZIKV\ninfection. When immunoprofiles of human blood infected with ZIKV were\ncompared, a classical/intermediate monocyte-mediated M1-skewed\ninflammation by the African-lineage ZIKV infection was observed, in\ncontrast to a non-classical monocyte-mediated M2-skewed\nimmunosuppression by the Asian-lineage ZIKV infection. Importantly,\ninfection of the blood of pregnant women revealed an enhanced\nsusceptibility to ZIKV infection. Specifically, Asian-lineage ZIKV\ninfection of pregnant women's blood led to an exacerbated M2-skewed\nimmunosuppression of non-classical monocytes in conjunction with a\nglobal suppression of type I interferon-signaling pathway and an\naberrant expression of host genes associated with pregnancy\ncomplications. Also, 30 ZIKV+ sera from symptomatic pregnant patients\nshowed elevated levels of M2-skewed immunosuppressive cytokines and\npregnancy-complication-associated fibronectin-1. This study\ndemonstrates the differential immunomodulatory responses of blood\nmonocytes, particularly during pregnancy, on infection with different\nlineages of ZIKV. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{4}</strong> Virus alters mosquito genes.\nDate: Tue 22 Aug 2017.\nSource: bioRxiv journal (edited)\n(http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/22/179416) \nref: Etebari K, Hegde S, Saldana MA, et al. Global transcriptome\nanalysis of _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes in response to Zika virus\ninfection. bioRxiv 179416; doi:10.1101/179416\n-\nZika virus (ZIKV) of the Flaviviridae family is a recently emerged\nmosquito-borne virus that has been implicated in the surge of the\nnumber of microcephaly instances in South America. The recent rapid\nspread of the virus led to its declaration as a global health\nemergency by the World Health Organization. The virus is transmitted\nmainly by the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_ that also vectors dengue virus,\nhowever little is known about the interactions of the virus with the\nmosquito vector. In this study, we investigated the transcriptome\nprofiles of whole _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes in response to ZIKV\ninfection at 2, 7, and 14 days post-infection using RNA-Seq. Results\nshowed changes in the abundance of a large number of transcripts at\neach time point following infection, with 18 transcripts commonly\nchanged among the 3 time points. Gene ontology analysis revealed that\nmost of the altered genes are involved in metabolic process, cellular\nprocess and proteolysis. In addition, 486 long intergenic non-coding\nRNAs were identified altered upon ZIKV infection. Further, we found\ncorrelational changes of a number of potential mRNA target genes with\nthat of altered host microRNAs. The outcomes provide a basic\nunderstanding of _Ae. aegypti_ responses to ZIKV and helps to\ndetermine host factors involved in replication or mosquito host\nanti-viral response against the virus. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) Mosquito vector competence depends on the relationship of virus and\nthe mosquito, and the defenses that the mosquito can mobilize against\nthe virus infection. Studies, such as the one above, can document the\nchanges that occur when the virus infects the mosquito, and if\ndifferences in relative vector efficiency of different geographic\nstrains of this mosquito might be related to alternations in mosquito\ngenes when infected. It would be interesting to know if these gene\nchanges affect fitness, and especially longevity of infected\nmosquitoes. - Mod.TY \n<br><br><strong>{5}</strong> Virus effects on sperm, body fluids.\nDate: Mon 21 Aug 2017.\nSource: The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal (edited)\n(http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(17)30444-9/abstract) \nref: Joguet G, Mansuy JM, Matusali G, et al.

To investigate the effects of Zika\nvirus infection on semen and clearance of Zika virus from semen and\nbody fluids, we aimed to study a cohort of Zika virus-infected men. Methods\nThis prospective observational study recruited men presenting with\nacute Zika virus infection at Pointe-Ã -Pitre University Hospital in\nGuadeloupe, French Caribbean, where a Zika virus outbreak occurred\nbetween April and November, 2016. Blood, urine, and semen were\ncollected at days 7, 11, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 after symptom onset,\nand semen characteristics, such as total sperm count, sperm motility,\nvitality, and morphology, and reproductive hormone concentrations,\nsuch as testosterone, inhibin, follicle-stimulating hormone, and\nluteinising hormone, were assessed. At days 7, 11, and 20, semen was\nprocessed to isolate motile spermatozoa. Zika virus RNA was detected\nby RT-PCR using whole blood, serum, urine, seminal plasma, semen\ncells, and motile spermatozoa fractions. Zika virus was isolated from\ndifferent sperm fractions on Vero E6 cultures. Findings\n15 male volunteers (mean age 35 years SD 5; range 25-44) with acute\nZika virus infection and positive Zika virus RNA detection in blood or\nurine were enrolled. Total sperm count was decreased from median\n119âÃâ10^6 spermatozoa (IQR interquartile range 22-234)\nat day 7, to 45.2âÃâ10^6 (16.5-89.6) at day 30, and 70\nÃ 10^6 (28.5-81.4) at day 60, respectively, after Zika virus\ninfection. Inhibin values increased from 93.5 pg/mL (IQR 55-162) at\nday 7 to 150 pg/mL (78-209) at day 120 when total sperm count\nrecovered. In motile spermatozoa obtained after density gradient\nseparation, Zika virus RNA was found in 3 of 14 patients at day 7, 4\nof 15 at day 11, and 4 of 15 at day 20, and replication-competent\nvirus was found in the tested patient. Seminal shedding kinetics\nseemed heterogeneous among patients. Whole blood was the fluid most\nfrequently positive for Zika virus RNA (62 of 92 samples) and 3\npatients remained positive at day 120. Interpretation\nSemen alterations early after acute Zika virus infection might affect\nfertility and could be explained by virus effects on the testis and\nepididymis. Frequency of shedding and high viral load in semen,\ntogether with the presence of replicative virus in a motile\nspermatozoa fraction, can lead to Zika virus transmission during\nsexual contact and assisted reproduction procedures. Whole blood seems\nto be the best specimen for Zika virus RNA detection, diagnosis, and\nfollow-up. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall In a new study that included 12 men in French Guiana who had Zika\nvirus, 4 never had any detectable Zika in their semen, 1 excreted Zika\nvirus in his semen for at least 3 days, and 7 had Zika virus in semen\nfor at least 1 month.

Vaccines protect fetus from Zika. JAMA. 2017; 318(8):\n689. doi:10.1001/jama.2017.11200\n-\nResearchers funded in part by the National Institutes of Health have\nrecently demonstrated that 2 experimental vaccines can restrict\ntransmission of Zika virus from pregnant mice to their fetuses,\nthereby shielding offspring from congenital damage or death. Multiple candidate Zika vaccines have been shown protective against\ninfection with the virus in animal studies, with several now in human\ntrials, but none were tested in the context of pregnancy, according to\nthe authors of the study published in Cell\n(http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(17)30759-6). The 2\nvaccine candidates investigated in the new study are the 1st to\ndemonstrate efficacy in preventing vertical transmission of the virus\nand related fetal death in an animal model. Although the vaccines were\nadministered to female mice prior to pregnancy, the result is\nconsidered an important step toward developing a vaccine that could be\nsafely given to pregnant women. One of the 2 candidates is a modified messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine\nencoding Zika genes, developed by the biotechnology company Moderna.\nIt is already in safety trials in women who are not pregnant. The\nother is a live-attenuated Zika strain developed by researchers at the\nUniversity of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). The testing was carried out by scientists from the National Institute\nof Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Washington University School of\nMedicine, and UTMB. The researchers 1st vaccinated the mice with 1 of\nthe vaccines or a placebo. After mating, the animals were challenged\nwith the virus 6 days into pregnancy. A week later, more than 50\npercent of placentas and fetuses from mice administered the mRNA\nvaccine had virtually no Zika RNA. The remainder had \"substantially\nlower\" levels relative to placebo.\nThe live vaccine provided broader protection: 78 percent of placentas\nand 83 percent of fetuses had Zika RNA at or below the level of\ndetection, while the placebo group exhibited significantly higher\nlevels of placental and fetal Zika RNA. Mice vaccinated with either\nvaccine had significantly higher rates of fetal viability; whereas 100\npercent of fetuses from mice vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine were\nborn, none survived to term in the placebo group. A working group funded by the Wellcome Trust recently approved ethical\nguidelines for testing such vaccines in pregnant women, normally\nexcluded from drug trials. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) It is reassuring to learn that at least 2 vaccines are now entering\nclinical trials in women. Although anti-Zika virus drugs are under\ndevelopment, preventing infection through vaccination seems to be the\nmost effective measure to prevent fetal infection and adverse effects\nof the virus infection in adults. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"180":{"title":"Eastern equine encephalitis - USA (08): (GA, OH) equine\r\n\t","date":["31","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH/EDR> Eastern equine encephalitis - USA (08): (GA, OH) equine\r\n\t[EXTERNAL]","summary":" A ProMED-mail post (http://www.promedmail.org) ProMED-mail is a program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases (http://www.isid.org)  In this update: <br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Georgia <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Ohio   <br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Georgia.

EEE virus is a mosquito-borne virus that causes swelling of the brain and is fatal in horses 70 to 90 percent of the time. EEE has also been detected in the mosquito population in western Chatham County, and a horse in Effingham County tested positive for EEE earlier this month August 2017.  The health department encourages horse and large animal owners to vaccinate their animals against the virus and to clean out watering sources, such as buckets and troughs every 3 to 4 days to prevent mosquitoes from breeding in those areas.  For more information on EEE, see: (http://www.cdc.gov/EasternEquineEncephalitis/).   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)   <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Ohio.

The animal was euthanized in late July 2017 after showing neurological signs. The animal was not vaccinated against the disease and lived near a low-lying area typically prone to harboring mosquitoes. EEE is often transmitted by mosquitoes and can be transmitted to humans; however, only a few cases are reported each year, and most infected persons report no apparent illness.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  The arbovirus season is upon us. The watch word is \"vaccinate!\"  The EEE vaccination is usually combined with western EE, West Nile virus and tetanus. This is cheap insurance to protect your animal from these diseases. If you have not already vaccinated, please do so now. If you vaccinated longer than 6 months ago, please revaccinate, as EEE immunity wanes the fastest. - Mod.TG  ProMED HealthMaps: Georgia, United States: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/213) Ohio, United States: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/237)  ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Uruguay":{},"Uzbekistan":{},"Vanuatu":{"182":{"title":"Invasive mosquito - New Caledonia (02): comment ","date":["31","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH/EDR> Invasive mosquito - New Caledonia (02): comment [EXTERNAL]","summary":" A ProMED-mail post (http://www.promedmail.org) ProMED-mail is a program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases (http://www.isid.org) . Date: Thu 31 Aug 2017. From: Michael J. Bangs (mbangs@fmi.com) (edited)   It stands to reason that the presence of _Anopheles farauti_ as the new entrant into New Caledonia is presumably recent. The nearest neighbor is Vanuatu, a malaria-endemic country that has but one anopheline species present in that island group, _Anopheles farauti_ sensu stricto, an effective malaria vector provided you add _Plasmodium_ to the mix.  _Anopheles farauti_ is one member of 8 known sibling species in the _Farauti_ Complex (closely related species that are morphologically identical, thus confounding accurate identification without the use of molecular techniques). It is by far the most widely distributed species in the complex in the southwest Pacific region (Maluku island group, eastern Indonesia to northern Australia, PNG, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu). The species' ability to inhabit brackish water environments (predominantly a coastal inhabitant) has aided in its dispersal throughout the region.  The origin of the anopheline population in New Caledonia might remain a mystery, but this discovery is of concern. If the area of establishment is relatively confined, it might be possible to eliminate this species before it extends further into the country. Foremost, identify the species.   Michael J. Bangs, MSPH, PhD. Public Health & Malaria Control International SOS Kuala Kencana, Papua, Indonesia (mbangs@fmi.com)  ProMED thanks Dr. Bangs for his comments.  The _Anopheles_ reported in the previous posting was found in an area of La Tontouta, north of Noumea. One hopes that the area of discovery is small enough to permit control.

As of August 2017, more than 80,000 cases have been reported. Although most cases have been reported in the south, there has been a sharp increase in cases in the north, especially in Hanoi.(/p) (p)Dengue is spread through mosquito bites and can cause symptoms such as fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, rash, and pain in the eyes, joints, and muscles.(/p) (h3)What can travelers do to prevent dengue?(/h3) (p)Because mosquitoes transmit dengue to people, travelers to Vietnam should (a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/avoid-bug-bites\")protect themselves against mosquito bites(/a) to avoid getting the illness. There is no vaccine or medicine currently available in the United States to prevent or treat dengue.(/p) (p)Learn more about dengue, how to prevent it, and what to do if you think you are infected

Source: Anadolu Agency (edited) (http://aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/cholera-has-killed-2-018-people-in-yemen-who/894568)   A total of 2018 people have been killed by a cholera epidemic in war-torn Yemen since late April 2017, the WHO said Sat 26 Aug 2017.  In a statement, the WHO said 565 041 suspected cases of cholera have been recorded in the country since 27 Apr 2017. According to the WHO statement, the recorded suspected cases were in 22 out of 23 provinces. The UN agency said the highest number of fatalities, 382 cases, was recorded in the northwestern Hajjah province, while in western Yemen's Hudaida province only around 70 000 suspected cases were recorded.  Impoverished Yemen has remained in a state of civil war since 2014, when Houthi rebels overran much of the country, including the capital Sanaa. The conflict escalated when Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies launched a massive air campaign in 2015 aimed at reversing Houthi military gains and shoring up Yemen's embattled government.  According to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), over 3 million people have fled their homes since the onset of the Yemen conflict, and more than 20 million throughout the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.  Byline: Mohamed al-Samei   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  Although a number of sources have reported decreasing numbers of daily cases, the numbers seem to support the continuing robust number of daily cases. If the epidemic were to continue at the current rate of cases per day, by the end of 2017, there could be 700 000 more cases for a total of 1.12 million cases since the end of April 2017, with 3300 more deaths for a total of about 5500 deaths over that period.

This continuing, record-breaking cholera disaster in Yemen is only 16 weeks old and now has more than 3 times the total number of cases of 2015 and 50 per cent more than the peak year of the Haiti outbreak (2011) of 340 311 cases. - Mod.LL  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/126).

Date: Fri 1 Sep 2017. Source: Save the Children (edited) (http://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/alarming-cholera-spike-yemen-coastal-region)   An outbreak of cholera has spiked dramatically in several areas of Yemen, including its largest governorate of Hodeidah, Save the Children is warning.  \nRecent health figures from the WHO reveal a far more mixed picture than reports of a nationwide slow-down have previously suggested.  In the coastal Hodeidah Governorate, where the charity runs malnutrition and cholera treatment centres, suspected cholera cases have jumped by 40 percent over the past 3 weeks amid heavy rains and a heat wave. Some districts are now reporting weekly caseload figures more than double their previous peaks. Hodeidah also has some of the worst malnutrition rates in the country, with an estimated one in 4 children under the age of 5 suffering from acute malnutrition. Save the Children has previously warned of the deadly link between hunger and cholera, with malnourished children at least 3 times more likely to die from diarrhoeal diseases.  Neighboring Raymah Governorate has seen an 18 percent increase in suspected cases over the past 3 weeks, while the southern port of Aden has seen a 12 percent jump.  James Denselow, Head of Conflict and Humanitarian Policy at Save the Children, said: \"This epidemic has spread at a frightening rate, and it's clear we're far from seeing the end of it. Given the ongoing bombing, and restrictions on bringing life-saving aid into the country, aid agencies are struggling to get cholera under control. Just when we think we've got it under control in one area, it suddenly spikes elsewhere.\"  \"We need to get more medical supplies, fuel and food into Yemen and to the children who need it without delay. The warring parties that are obstructing the country's ports, roads and airspace are directly responsible for this cholera outbreak and must immediately facilitate humanitarian relief.\"  Suspected cholera cases nationwide have declined from a peak of about 50 000 weekly cases at the end of June 2017 - but that drop stalled 3 weeks ago. Levels now remain at about 35 000 new cases every week.  In the last 4 months, there have been more than 591 100 suspected cases of cholera and 2035 deaths, according to WHO figures from Wed 30 Aug 2017.  \nChildren make up an increasing proportion of both suspected cases and deaths - representing 54 percent of cholera infections and nearly a 3rd of all deaths.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  Although a number of sources have reported decreasing numbers of daily cases, the numbers seem to support the continuing robust number of daily cases. If the epidemic were to continue at the current rate of cases per day, by the end of 2017, there could be 700 000 more cases for a total of 1.12 million cases since the end of April 2017, with 3300 more deaths for a total of about 5500 deaths over that period. With the continue hostilities in Yemen and the onset of the rainy season, whatever is being reported as a decrease in cases will likely and perhaps dramatically reversed. In the last month August 2017, there has been reported to have been 171 296 cases, 5710 new cases of cholera PER DAY.
