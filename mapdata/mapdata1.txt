Blaine Hollinger MD 1. There is also a seronegative window period that precedes the first detection of HBV DNA and prior to the appearance of HBsAg following acute infection. However, the level of virus may not be sufficient to cause HBV based on the HBV genotype (Hsia et al, 2006). 2. Is minipool NAT or ID NAT being done for HBV DNA detection by blood banks in Ireland? And if minipool NAT, how many samples were in the minipool since this could compromise sensitivity? 3. Was the archived donor specimen also tested for total anti-HBc, a test done in US blood facilities, but not in Ireland? 4. What is the evidence that the recipient was not previously infected with HBV, while bearing in mind that patients with chronic hepatitis B may be positive for IgM anti-HBc during acute reactivation of their disease. And if the recipient was IgM positive, what was the ratio of the anti-HBc test result based on the cutoff value and the patient's value? 5. Fortunately, the outcome is usually favorable with limited risk of chronicity in immunocompetent patients who acquire acute hepatitis B.  F. Blaine Hollinger, M.D. Professor of Medicine, Molecular Virology & Epidemiology Director, Eugene B. Casey Hepatitis Research Center Baylor College of Medicine Houston, TX It is always an honor to receive comments from Dr. Hollinger, a long time leader in viral hepatitis research. Regarding his questions/comments: 1. As I noted in the moderation of the original post, there is a lesser discussed \"window period\" occurring in the incubation period of acute hepatitis B prior to the development of HBsAg and before the development of anti-HBc (IgM and then IgG). The more classical \"window period\" occurs towards the end of acute hepatitis B, whether clinically overt or not, when HBsAg is not longer detectable by standard assays but before anti-HBs is detectable. The only serologic evidence of HBV is anti-HBc and IgM anti-HBc should be positive. HBV DNA is also detectable. It has been shown that blood transfused during this period can be infectious for HBV. 2-4. All good questions which I cannot supply answers to. 5. Most patients who are not immunosuppressed will clear HBV within 3-6 months. 10 percent will not although half of these are usually clear within a year. No information regarding the patient in this case was supplied. - Mod.LL   .

Majority of these patients are being treated in different hospitals in Kathmandu. 9 children with laboratory confirmed ST received treatment at STIDH and recovered uneventfully. It is quite surprising for me observing such a large number of ST cases being detected in Kathmandu, the biggest and most densely populated area of Nepal. Because ST has previously been almost exclusively detected in rural areas of Nepal. What is not yet clear is the impact of ST between the years 2004 and 2015. ST was first well documented in 2004 in Kathmandu (1), while the significant number of ST cases has only been detected since 2015. The widespread use of antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin, could be one possible explanation. In other words, healthcare workers in Nepal usually view any fever as typhoid fever, thus used to treat febrile patients with ciprofloxacin, which might have also worked simultaneously against ST too. However, nowadays, cefixime has become the drug of choice for typhoid fever, and it may, however, not work effectively against ST, resulting in emergence of ST in Nepal.<br><br><strong> Reference -</strong><br> 1.

Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, MD, PhD Clinical Research Unit Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital Kathmandu Nepal ProMED-mail thanks Dr Sher Bahadur Pun for his continued contributions on scrub typhus in Nepal. Doxycycline is the drug of choice and it is preferred over other tetracyclines for treatment of scrub typhus; it is rarely associated with staining of teeth in children younger than 8 years (1). Macrolides, such as azithromycin, are also reported to be efficacious (2). Fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, have been reported to be clinically effective in the treatment of scrub typhus in a few patients. However, some clinical studies suggest that fluoroquinolones are not as effective in patients with scrub typhus as other antibiotics (3,4). In vitro testing of some strains of _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, the cause of scrub typhus, has been reported to show resistance to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin (minimum inhibitory concentration=8 micrograms/mL) (5) and mutation in the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) of the gyrA gene associated with fluoroquinolone resistance has been found (3,5). These findings suggest that fluoroquinolones are likely not appropriate for the treatment of scrub typhus.<br><br><strong> References </strong><br> 1. Panpanich R, Garner P.
