The meeting was attended by the national teams as well as the staff from the southern region of Afghanistan and Balochistan province of Pakistan.  - Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: Pakistan: 2 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) environmental positive samples; Syria: 6 new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases; and, DR Congo: 1 new cVDPV2 case. Additionally, pre-notification was received this week of a new WPV1 case from Karachi, Pakistan, the 1st in Karachi since January 2016. The case will be officially reflected in next week's global data reporting.  Afghanistan  - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 6. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 10 Jul 2017, from Zabul province, neighbouring Kandahar province and Pakistan. - Preparations continue for a targeted vaccination round in the southern region of the country, scheduled on 11 Sep 2017  Pakistan  - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week; the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 3. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 11 Jun 2017, from Killa Abdullah, Balochistan. - Two new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) environmental positive samples were reported in the past week, from Karachi, Sindh (collected on 7 and 12 Aug 2017). - Additionally, pre-notification was received this week of a new WPV1 case from Karachi, Pakistan. The case will be officially reflected in next week's global data reporting. Karachi had previously been a key reservoir for WPV1 in Pakistan. Analysis is ongoing to determine the origin of this latest case and a response is being planned. The case had onset of paralysis on 11 Aug 2017. The last previous case from Karachi is from January 2016. - The National Task Force for Polio Eradication convened last week, chaired by the Prime Minister of Pakistan and attended by the senior leadership from the national and provincial levels. The Task force reviewed the revised National Emergency Action Plan 2017/18 and discussed mechanisms of accelerating the implementation of strategies to stop WPV1 transmission in the key hot spots. - Under the National Emergency Action Plan for polio eradication, the country is planning to implement 2 nation-wide and 2 sub-national vaccination rounds from September to December 2017.  Nigeria - - No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 21 Aug 2016 in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno. - Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and cVDPV2 strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016). - Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance.  Lake Chad Basin  - The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno, Nigeria in 2016) and cVDPV2 (Borno and Sokoto provinces in Nigeria in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak. - Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.  Central Africa  - One new case of cVDPV2 was reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), from Haut Lomami province, with onset of paralysis on 20 Jun 2017. The total number of cVDPV2 cases this year 2017 is now 8, in 2 separate outbreaks: in Haut Lomami province (6 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on 20 Jun 2017); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on 26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017, with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May 2017). - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time. Outbreak response is taking place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols, targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 across the 2 provinces. \n- The 1st mOPV2 round was implemented on 27-29 Jun 2017 in the 2 affected provinces; and the 2nd mOPV2 round ran from 13-15 Jul 2017 in Haut Lomami and 20-22 Jul 2017 in Maniema. - Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.  Middle East  - In Syria, 6 new cases of cVDPV2 were officially reported in the past week from Deir-Ez-Zour governorate, bringing the total number of cases in this outbreak to 39. Onset of paralysis of these cases is between 3 Mar 2017 and 10 Jul 2017. The bulk of all cases are from Deir-Ez-Zour, the epicentre of this outbreak. - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized and implemented, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Two vaccination campaigns are planned for both Deir-Ez-Zour and Raqqa governorates. - The 1st mOPV2 round in Deir-Ez-Zour was successfully carried out between 22-26 Jul 2017. Independent post-campaign monitoring reflected coverage of 88.4 percent (based on caregiver recall). - The 2nd immunization round for Deir-Ez-Zor governorate started on 22 Aug 2017 and is ongoing. Monovalent OPV2 is being provided for children between 0-59 months of age, and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) for children 2-23 months. In addition to polio vaccines, Aqua Tabs are being provided to families for water purification - 2.5 tons of water purification tablets for 400 000 people have been disseminated at health centers. - Plans are being finalized to mitigate the risks of further spread from the outbreak zone to neighbouring areas and countries, including immunization of at-risk populations in northwest Syria, Turkey and Lebanon.

All confirmed cases to date have had onset of paralysis before 14 Jul 2017. - Final lab results are pending for an additional 5 poliovirus type-2 (PV2) isolates (3 from Mayadeen and 1 from Boukamal districts, Deir Ez-Zor governorate, and 1 from Thawra district, Raqqa governorate). - The 2nd immunization round for Deir Ez-Zor started on 22 Aug 2017 and is ongoing due to high levels of population movement in and out of the governorate during the round. - WHO has organized the redistribution of vaccines and mapping of population movements to increase reach. An additional 90 000 mOPV2 doses are being transported from Damascus to Deir Ez-Zor, to cater for population influxes from As-Sukhnah, Homs governorate, and Al-Qa'im in Iraq. Corrective measures are expected to extend the round by 2 days. - Preparations for the 2nd immunization round for Raqqa are underway. - The total number of AFP cases detected in Deir Ez-Zor governorate since the beginning of 2017 is 122 (91 from Mayadeen, 10 from Deir Ez-Zor, and 21 from Boukamal districts). Raqqa governorate has reported 16 AFP cases (5 from Raqqa, 10 from Tell Abyad, and 1 from Thawra districts). Homs governorate has reported 28 AFP cases (12 from Homs city, 13 from Rastan, 1 from Tadmour and 2 from Talkalakh districts).  more details on the vaccination activities and future plans are available at the source URL as well as the epidemic curve and graphic representation of the vaccination status of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis cases by governorate and district. - Mod.MPP   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  In the above global summary, there is still identified transmission ongoing in Pakistan as seen by the positive environmental sample in Karachi as well as the early report on a case of WPV1 associated disease in Karachi. It will be interesting to learn of the genetic profile of the environmental isolates in Karachi (from this past week as well as from a few weeks ago) and compare them with the newly identified WPV1 associated case in Karachi to see if they are genetically related.  There has been more activity associated with cVDPV2 in both Syria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), with 6 newly confirmed cases in Syria and 1 newly confirmed case in the DR Congo. According to the Situation Report in section <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> above, there are still 5 additional PV2 (poliovirus type 2) isolates in Syria undergoing final testing  4 from Deir al Zour and 1 from Raqqa. Hence there will probably be more cases confirmed in the coming days or weeks. I have not been able to identify similar report information from the DR Congo outbreak so it is not clear if the transmission has been interrupted leaving a total of 8 cases, or if there are still probable cases pending confirmation.

The total amount of dead wild boars discovered in the woods around\nZlín, in the far east of the Czech Republic, stood at 94 at the end\nof August 2017. In this month, 23 new infected carcasses were found,\nwhich is a downward trend from July 2017, when 68 reports were sent\nto the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). The 1st report of\nASF in Czech wild boars was on Wed 21 Jun 2017. Many neighbouring countries have alerted their local pig producers to\nbe very careful what to feed their pigs - and their inhabitants what\nto purchase and how to dispose of it. So did Slovakia, according to\nthe Slovak Spectator. Zlín is only a few km away from the western\nSlovak border, to its north is Poland where ASF has been around since\n2014 and on its eastern border is Ukraine, where ASF has been\nconfirmed since 2011. In a presentation, given in mid-July 2017 to the European\nCommission's Standing Committee On Animals, Plants, Food and Feed\n(SCoPAFF), Dr Petr Šatrán of the Czech State Veterinary\nAdministration indicated that human activities are most likely the\ncause of the spread of the virus, seeing that the nearest reported\ncases of ASF were roughly 500 km 310.68 mi away and that the\npositive dead wild boars were found in inhabited areas. In the other country where ASF was found for the 1st time in 2017,\nRomania, things appear relatively quiet. News broke early this month\nAugust 2017 that ASF was also found on 2 backyard farms in the north\nof the country. Ever since, the Romanian authorities did not report\nany further outbreaks of ASF to the OIE. Of all other countries in the European Union, especially Poland has\ncontinued to report outbreaks of African Swine Fever in smaller and\nmiddle-sized operations. In August alone, on 23 farm sites of various\nsizes, ASF was found to have infected at least one animal, after which\nthe entire herd would have to be culled. The biggest operation in this respect was a farm near Monki, Podlaskie\nprovince, where all remaining 431 pigs had to be culled after 11 had\ndied as a result of ASF, on Sat 19 Aug 2017. Noteworthy as well was\nthe ASF-related closure of 2 farms in Lack, Lubelskie province, in\nearly August. These farms had 136 and 141 pigs respectively see also\nitem 2.

This was said by Poland's Minister of Agriculture,\nKrzysztof Yurgel, Niezalezna reports. As reported, the length of the fence will be 729 km 452.98 mi,\ncosting Poland 130 million zloties (more than 36.2 million USD). The\nfinal decision on a fence will be made within the next 3 weeks. According to experts, ASF has developed in the territory of Poland\n\"thanks to\" the wild boars who entered from Belarus. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) The accumulated ASF OIE data from Poland as of Thu 31 Aug 2017, are\nas follows (start of event 22 May 2014):\nNumber of follow-up reports: 189\nTotal outbreaks: 550 (Submitted)\nSpecies/ Susceptible/ Cases/ Deaths/ Killed and disposed of/\nSlaughtered\nWild boar/ - / 620 / 620 / 0 / 0\nDomestic Swine/ 6303/ 402/ 188/ 6097/ 0 A map showing ASF cases reported globally to the OIE since 1 Jan 2017,\nas of Thu 31 Aug 2017, is available at (http://tinyurl.com/ybexasqm).\nClick on the European cluster, zoom in to each of the countries of\ninterest. EU disease control measures require designation of risk areas as Part\nI (wild boar at risk, but no cases found), Part II (wild boar testing\npositive but no spill over into domestic pigs), Part III (cases in\nwild boar and occasional spill over into domestic pigs) and Part IV\nwhich concerns the island of Sardinia only. Consignments of live pigs,\nlive wild boars, meat of either source and animal by-products of\neither source are only allowed under certain derogations. For a full\nexplanation, see European Commission Implementing Decision\n2014/708/EU. ASF, a viral disease against which no vaccine has become available so\nfar, is currently threatening central and western Europe, where dense\npopulations of wild boar are present. According to a recent update of DEFRA (UK) ASF situation assessment,\nthe continuing cases in the Czech Republic, the spread in Poland which\nappears to be due to several breakdowns in biosecurity and the new\noutbreaks in Romania are \"concerning\". This signifies a spread in\ngeographic distribution, a possible drop in biosecurity awareness and\ntherefore an increase in the weight of infection in East Europe. Despite the relatively low level of trade in live pigs, there could be\na substantial movement of people, vehicles and personal imports of\npork products, therefore the risk of ASF introduction to the UK has\nbeen raised from \"very low\" (that is, \"rare but could occur\") to\n\"low\". The Russian veterinary watchdog Rosselkhoznadzor believes ASF will\nkeep moving west via 2 main pathways. The southerly route, has already\nseen the virus spread from Ukraine to Moldova. Russian vets believe it\ncould penetrate central Romania, then move to the Balkans, including\nBulgaria and Serbia. On the northern route, now that ASF has been found in the Czech\nRepublic, Rosselkhoznadzor believes, if it gains a foothold, it is\nlikely to head further west, with Germany next in the firing line.

The\nfollowing is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In:\nChronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract.\nGreydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in\npress): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons,\nvaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside\nof Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as\n60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection\nlengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:\n- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam;\n- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however,\nhave suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be\neffective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and\noutbreak situations (63, 64). \"References\n\n57.

The meeting was attended by the national teams as well as the staff from the southern region of Afghanistan and Balochistan province of Pakistan.  - Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: Pakistan: 2 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) environmental positive samples; Syria: 6 new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases; and, DR Congo: 1 new cVDPV2 case. Additionally, pre-notification was received this week of a new WPV1 case from Karachi, Pakistan, the 1st in Karachi since January 2016. The case will be officially reflected in next week's global data reporting.  Afghanistan  - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 6. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 10 Jul 2017, from Zabul province, neighbouring Kandahar province and Pakistan. - Preparations continue for a targeted vaccination round in the southern region of the country, scheduled on 11 Sep 2017  Pakistan  - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week; the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 3. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 11 Jun 2017, from Killa Abdullah, Balochistan. - Two new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) environmental positive samples were reported in the past week, from Karachi, Sindh (collected on 7 and 12 Aug 2017). - Additionally, pre-notification was received this week of a new WPV1 case from Karachi, Pakistan. The case will be officially reflected in next week's global data reporting. Karachi had previously been a key reservoir for WPV1 in Pakistan. Analysis is ongoing to determine the origin of this latest case and a response is being planned. The case had onset of paralysis on 11 Aug 2017. The last previous case from Karachi is from January 2016. - The National Task Force for Polio Eradication convened last week, chaired by the Prime Minister of Pakistan and attended by the senior leadership from the national and provincial levels. The Task force reviewed the revised National Emergency Action Plan 2017/18 and discussed mechanisms of accelerating the implementation of strategies to stop WPV1 transmission in the key hot spots. - Under the National Emergency Action Plan for polio eradication, the country is planning to implement 2 nation-wide and 2 sub-national vaccination rounds from September to December 2017.  Nigeria - - No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 21 Aug 2016 in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno. - Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and cVDPV2 strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016). - Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance.  Lake Chad Basin  - The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno, Nigeria in 2016) and cVDPV2 (Borno and Sokoto provinces in Nigeria in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak. - Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.  Central Africa  - One new case of cVDPV2 was reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), from Haut Lomami province, with onset of paralysis on 20 Jun 2017. The total number of cVDPV2 cases this year 2017 is now 8, in 2 separate outbreaks: in Haut Lomami province (6 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on 20 Jun 2017); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on 26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017, with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May 2017). - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time. Outbreak response is taking place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols, targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 across the 2 provinces. \n- The 1st mOPV2 round was implemented on 27-29 Jun 2017 in the 2 affected provinces; and the 2nd mOPV2 round ran from 13-15 Jul 2017 in Haut Lomami and 20-22 Jul 2017 in Maniema. - Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.  Middle East  - In Syria, 6 new cases of cVDPV2 were officially reported in the past week from Deir-Ez-Zour governorate, bringing the total number of cases in this outbreak to 39. Onset of paralysis of these cases is between 3 Mar 2017 and 10 Jul 2017. The bulk of all cases are from Deir-Ez-Zour, the epicentre of this outbreak. - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized and implemented, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Two vaccination campaigns are planned for both Deir-Ez-Zour and Raqqa governorates. - The 1st mOPV2 round in Deir-Ez-Zour was successfully carried out between 22-26 Jul 2017. Independent post-campaign monitoring reflected coverage of 88.4 percent (based on caregiver recall). - The 2nd immunization round for Deir-Ez-Zor governorate started on 22 Aug 2017 and is ongoing. Monovalent OPV2 is being provided for children between 0-59 months of age, and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) for children 2-23 months. In addition to polio vaccines, Aqua Tabs are being provided to families for water purification - 2.5 tons of water purification tablets for 400 000 people have been disseminated at health centers. - Plans are being finalized to mitigate the risks of further spread from the outbreak zone to neighbouring areas and countries, including immunization of at-risk populations in northwest Syria, Turkey and Lebanon.

All confirmed cases to date have had onset of paralysis before 14 Jul 2017. - Final lab results are pending for an additional 5 poliovirus type-2 (PV2) isolates (3 from Mayadeen and 1 from Boukamal districts, Deir Ez-Zor governorate, and 1 from Thawra district, Raqqa governorate). - The 2nd immunization round for Deir Ez-Zor started on 22 Aug 2017 and is ongoing due to high levels of population movement in and out of the governorate during the round. - WHO has organized the redistribution of vaccines and mapping of population movements to increase reach. An additional 90 000 mOPV2 doses are being transported from Damascus to Deir Ez-Zor, to cater for population influxes from As-Sukhnah, Homs governorate, and Al-Qa'im in Iraq. Corrective measures are expected to extend the round by 2 days. - Preparations for the 2nd immunization round for Raqqa are underway. - The total number of AFP cases detected in Deir Ez-Zor governorate since the beginning of 2017 is 122 (91 from Mayadeen, 10 from Deir Ez-Zor, and 21 from Boukamal districts). Raqqa governorate has reported 16 AFP cases (5 from Raqqa, 10 from Tell Abyad, and 1 from Thawra districts). Homs governorate has reported 28 AFP cases (12 from Homs city, 13 from Rastan, 1 from Tadmour and 2 from Talkalakh districts).  more details on the vaccination activities and future plans are available at the source URL as well as the epidemic curve and graphic representation of the vaccination status of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis cases by governorate and district. - Mod.MPP   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  In the above global summary, there is still identified transmission ongoing in Pakistan as seen by the positive environmental sample in Karachi as well as the early report on a case of WPV1 associated disease in Karachi. It will be interesting to learn of the genetic profile of the environmental isolates in Karachi (from this past week as well as from a few weeks ago) and compare them with the newly identified WPV1 associated case in Karachi to see if they are genetically related.  There has been more activity associated with cVDPV2 in both Syria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), with 6 newly confirmed cases in Syria and 1 newly confirmed case in the DR Congo. According to the Situation Report in section <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> above, there are still 5 additional PV2 (poliovirus type 2) isolates in Syria undergoing final testing  4 from Deir al Zour and 1 from Raqqa. Hence there will probably be more cases confirmed in the coming days or weeks. I have not been able to identify similar report information from the DR Congo outbreak so it is not clear if the transmission has been interrupted leaving a total of 8 cases, or if there are still probable cases pending confirmation.

The meeting was attended by the national teams as well as the staff from the southern region of Afghanistan and Balochistan province of Pakistan.  - Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: Pakistan: 2 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) environmental positive samples; Syria: 6 new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases; and, DR Congo: 1 new cVDPV2 case. Additionally, pre-notification was received this week of a new WPV1 case from Karachi, Pakistan, the 1st in Karachi since January 2016. The case will be officially reflected in next week's global data reporting.  Afghanistan  - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 6. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 10 Jul 2017, from Zabul province, neighbouring Kandahar province and Pakistan. - Preparations continue for a targeted vaccination round in the southern region of the country, scheduled on 11 Sep 2017  Pakistan  - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week; the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 3. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 11 Jun 2017, from Killa Abdullah, Balochistan. - Two new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) environmental positive samples were reported in the past week, from Karachi, Sindh (collected on 7 and 12 Aug 2017). - Additionally, pre-notification was received this week of a new WPV1 case from Karachi, Pakistan. The case will be officially reflected in next week's global data reporting. Karachi had previously been a key reservoir for WPV1 in Pakistan. Analysis is ongoing to determine the origin of this latest case and a response is being planned. The case had onset of paralysis on 11 Aug 2017. The last previous case from Karachi is from January 2016. - The National Task Force for Polio Eradication convened last week, chaired by the Prime Minister of Pakistan and attended by the senior leadership from the national and provincial levels. The Task force reviewed the revised National Emergency Action Plan 2017/18 and discussed mechanisms of accelerating the implementation of strategies to stop WPV1 transmission in the key hot spots. - Under the National Emergency Action Plan for polio eradication, the country is planning to implement 2 nation-wide and 2 sub-national vaccination rounds from September to December 2017.  Nigeria - - No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 21 Aug 2016 in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno. - Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and cVDPV2 strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016). - Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance.  Lake Chad Basin  - The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno, Nigeria in 2016) and cVDPV2 (Borno and Sokoto provinces in Nigeria in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak. - Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.  Central Africa  - One new case of cVDPV2 was reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), from Haut Lomami province, with onset of paralysis on 20 Jun 2017. The total number of cVDPV2 cases this year 2017 is now 8, in 2 separate outbreaks: in Haut Lomami province (6 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on 20 Jun 2017); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on 26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017, with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May 2017). - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time. Outbreak response is taking place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols, targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 across the 2 provinces. \n- The 1st mOPV2 round was implemented on 27-29 Jun 2017 in the 2 affected provinces; and the 2nd mOPV2 round ran from 13-15 Jul 2017 in Haut Lomami and 20-22 Jul 2017 in Maniema. - Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.  Middle East  - In Syria, 6 new cases of cVDPV2 were officially reported in the past week from Deir-Ez-Zour governorate, bringing the total number of cases in this outbreak to 39. Onset of paralysis of these cases is between 3 Mar 2017 and 10 Jul 2017. The bulk of all cases are from Deir-Ez-Zour, the epicentre of this outbreak. - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized and implemented, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Two vaccination campaigns are planned for both Deir-Ez-Zour and Raqqa governorates. - The 1st mOPV2 round in Deir-Ez-Zour was successfully carried out between 22-26 Jul 2017. Independent post-campaign monitoring reflected coverage of 88.4 percent (based on caregiver recall). - The 2nd immunization round for Deir-Ez-Zor governorate started on 22 Aug 2017 and is ongoing. Monovalent OPV2 is being provided for children between 0-59 months of age, and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) for children 2-23 months. In addition to polio vaccines, Aqua Tabs are being provided to families for water purification - 2.5 tons of water purification tablets for 400 000 people have been disseminated at health centers. - Plans are being finalized to mitigate the risks of further spread from the outbreak zone to neighbouring areas and countries, including immunization of at-risk populations in northwest Syria, Turkey and Lebanon.

All confirmed cases to date have had onset of paralysis before 14 Jul 2017. - Final lab results are pending for an additional 5 poliovirus type-2 (PV2) isolates (3 from Mayadeen and 1 from Boukamal districts, Deir Ez-Zor governorate, and 1 from Thawra district, Raqqa governorate). - The 2nd immunization round for Deir Ez-Zor started on 22 Aug 2017 and is ongoing due to high levels of population movement in and out of the governorate during the round. - WHO has organized the redistribution of vaccines and mapping of population movements to increase reach. An additional 90 000 mOPV2 doses are being transported from Damascus to Deir Ez-Zor, to cater for population influxes from As-Sukhnah, Homs governorate, and Al-Qa'im in Iraq. Corrective measures are expected to extend the round by 2 days. - Preparations for the 2nd immunization round for Raqqa are underway. - The total number of AFP cases detected in Deir Ez-Zor governorate since the beginning of 2017 is 122 (91 from Mayadeen, 10 from Deir Ez-Zor, and 21 from Boukamal districts). Raqqa governorate has reported 16 AFP cases (5 from Raqqa, 10 from Tell Abyad, and 1 from Thawra districts). Homs governorate has reported 28 AFP cases (12 from Homs city, 13 from Rastan, 1 from Tadmour and 2 from Talkalakh districts).  more details on the vaccination activities and future plans are available at the source URL as well as the epidemic curve and graphic representation of the vaccination status of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis cases by governorate and district. - Mod.MPP   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  In the above global summary, there is still identified transmission ongoing in Pakistan as seen by the positive environmental sample in Karachi as well as the early report on a case of WPV1 associated disease in Karachi. It will be interesting to learn of the genetic profile of the environmental isolates in Karachi (from this past week as well as from a few weeks ago) and compare them with the newly identified WPV1 associated case in Karachi to see if they are genetically related.  There has been more activity associated with cVDPV2 in both Syria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), with 6 newly confirmed cases in Syria and 1 newly confirmed case in the DR Congo. According to the Situation Report in section <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> above, there are still 5 additional PV2 (poliovirus type 2) isolates in Syria undergoing final testing  4 from Deir al Zour and 1 from Raqqa. Hence there will probably be more cases confirmed in the coming days or weeks. I have not been able to identify similar report information from the DR Congo outbreak so it is not clear if the transmission has been interrupted leaving a total of 8 cases, or if there are still probable cases pending confirmation.

The total amount of dead wild boars discovered in the woods around\nZlín, in the far east of the Czech Republic, stood at 94 at the end\nof August 2017. In this month, 23 new infected carcasses were found,\nwhich is a downward trend from July 2017, when 68 reports were sent\nto the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). The 1st report of\nASF in Czech wild boars was on Wed 21 Jun 2017. Many neighbouring countries have alerted their local pig producers to\nbe very careful what to feed their pigs - and their inhabitants what\nto purchase and how to dispose of it. So did Slovakia, according to\nthe Slovak Spectator. Zlín is only a few km away from the western\nSlovak border, to its north is Poland where ASF has been around since\n2014 and on its eastern border is Ukraine, where ASF has been\nconfirmed since 2011. In a presentation, given in mid-July 2017 to the European\nCommission's Standing Committee On Animals, Plants, Food and Feed\n(SCoPAFF), Dr Petr Šatrán of the Czech State Veterinary\nAdministration indicated that human activities are most likely the\ncause of the spread of the virus, seeing that the nearest reported\ncases of ASF were roughly 500 km 310.68 mi away and that the\npositive dead wild boars were found in inhabited areas. In the other country where ASF was found for the 1st time in 2017,\nRomania, things appear relatively quiet. News broke early this month\nAugust 2017 that ASF was also found on 2 backyard farms in the north\nof the country.

However, it is summarized\nbelow: The Dansk Supermarket Group (DSG) recalled cold-packed smoked salmon,\nmanufactured in Poland, after _Listeria monocytogenes_ was identified\nin the product. The isolate from the product was almost identical by\nwhole genome sequencing to isolates from 3 of 4 patients, whose food\nhistory in 3 of the patients identified the smoked salmon as the\nlikely source. The smoked salmon product was recalled from about 600 stores in\nDenmark and a limited number in Metro Poland. Up to 3 of the 4 patients had become ill in the same week in August\n2017 and the 4th had become ill in May 2017. One of the 4 patients has\ndied. All 4 patients had severe underlying disease. DSG consists of chains (fotex, Bilka, Netto, and Salling) with more\nthan 1400 stores in Denmark, Germany, Poland and Sweden. Refrigerated smoked salmon is a recognized potential source for\nlisteriosis, similar to other cold cut meats and non-heat treated\ncured smoked meats, being a ready-to-eat product that does not require\nfurther cooking before eating. The news report said that more cases\nrelated to this outbreak were expected, despite the recall, as the\nincubation period for listeriosis is up to 3 weeks actually symptoms\ncan start up to as 70 days after exposure. - Mod.ML A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at:\n(http://healthmap.org/promed/p/113).

EEE virus is a mosquito-borne virus that causes swelling of the brain and is fatal in horses 70 to 90 percent of the time. EEE has also been detected in the mosquito population in western Chatham County, and a horse in Effingham County tested positive for EEE earlier this month August 2017.  The health department encourages horse and large animal owners to vaccinate their animals against the virus and to clean out watering sources, such as buckets and troughs every 3 to 4 days to prevent mosquitoes from breeding in those areas.

The animal was euthanized in late July 2017 after showing neurological signs. The animal was not vaccinated against the disease and lived near a low-lying area typically prone to harboring mosquitoes.

If you vaccinated longer than 6 months ago, please revaccinate, as EEE immunity wanes the fastest. - Mod.TG  ProMED HealthMaps: Georgia, United States: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/213) Ohio, United States: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/237)  ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Germany":{"175":{"title":"African swine fever - Europe (21): Czech Rep, Romania,\r\n\tPoland, wild boar, spread ","date":["31","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH/EDR> African swine fever - Europe (21): Czech Rep, Romania,\r\n\tPoland, wild boar, spread [EXTERNAL]","summary":"\nAFRICAN SWINE FEVER - EUROPE (21): CZECH REPUBLIC, ROMANIA, POLAND,\nWILD BOAR, SPREAD\n*\nA ProMED-mail post\n(http://www.promedmail.org)\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n(http://www.isid.org) In this posting:\n<br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Czech Rep, Romania\n<br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Poland, fence considered \n<br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Czech Rep, Romania.\nDate: Wed 30 Aug 2017.\nSource: Pig Progress net (edited)\n(http://www.pigprogress.net/Health/Articles/2017/8/ASF-update-Czech-Republic-approaches-100-reports-177268E/) \nAlthough the outbreaks seem to be contained to one region of the Czech\nRepublic, African Swine Fever ASF continues to make victims among\nthe country's wild boar population. The total amount of dead wild boars discovered in the woods around\nZlín, in the far east of the Czech Republic, stood at 94 at the end\nof August 2017. In this month, 23 new infected carcasses were found,\nwhich is a downward trend from July 2017, when 68 reports were sent\nto the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). The 1st report of\nASF in Czech wild boars was on Wed 21 Jun 2017. Many neighbouring countries have alerted their local pig producers to\nbe very careful what to feed their pigs - and their inhabitants what\nto purchase and how to dispose of it. So did Slovakia, according to\nthe Slovak Spectator. Zlín is only a few km away from the western\nSlovak border, to its north is Poland where ASF has been around since\n2014 and on its eastern border is Ukraine, where ASF has been\nconfirmed since 2011. In a presentation, given in mid-July 2017 to the European\nCommission's Standing Committee On Animals, Plants, Food and Feed\n(SCoPAFF), Dr Petr Šatrán of the Czech State Veterinary\nAdministration indicated that human activities are most likely the\ncause of the spread of the virus, seeing that the nearest reported\ncases of ASF were roughly 500 km 310.68 mi away and that the\npositive dead wild boars were found in inhabited areas. In the other country where ASF was found for the 1st time in 2017,\nRomania, things appear relatively quiet. News broke early this month\nAugust 2017 that ASF was also found on 2 backyard farms in the north\nof the country.

The health department will take help from experts at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and US-based agency Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to check the spread of Japanese encephalitis in Gorakhpur region.  In April 2017, the department had launched an intensive vaccination drive in 20 districts prone to Japanese encephalitis (JE) and acute encephalitis syndrome (AES).  About 93 lakh 9 300 000 children were vaccinated before the onset of monsoon. Though the number of JE patients came down, AES cases continued to grow. See Japanese encephalitis & other - India (18): comment http://promedmail.org/post/20170830.5283261 where the decline in JE and the increase of AES is described and graphed. - Mod.TY  Talking to HT, secretary (health and family welfare) V Hekali Zhimomi said, \"The clinical and laboratory test of the samples of patients' serum attributed 50 percent of AES cases to scrub typhus, Coxsackie virus, enterovirus (polio entrovirus, echo virus), malaria, herpes, meningoencephalitis, tuberculous encephalitis while the remaining 50 percent of the pathogens remained unknown.\"  The initial study attributed scrub typhus to mites and unhygienic conditions.  A team of experts from ICMR visited BRD Medical College and government hospitals after the death of the 30 children on 10 - 11 Aug 2017 to take stock of ground reality.  Later, the team led by ICMR director-general Soumya Swaminathan met chief minister Yogi Adityanath to discuss the measures required to strengthen health facilities.  During the meeting, the health department officers drew the attention of ICMR scientists towards unidentified pathogens that were infecting children in Gorakhpur and adjoining districts.  \"The ICMR officers assured assistance and recommended better health services in rural areas and mobilising human resource at government hospitals,\" Zhimomi said.  She said since quacks and healers active in rural areas were the 1st contact person for patients, the health department was planning to involve them in fighting the menace.  Quacks, popular as 'jhola chhap doctor' in east UP, will be given training to guide suspected AES patients.  Auxiliary nursing midwives (ANM), accredited social health activists (ASHA) and anganbari workers in villages are being trained to create awareness among the people aganbaris are a type of rural mother and child care center in India.  The department has also decided to deploy health education officers in awareness programme.  The focus will be on early admission of patients at nearby primary health centres (PHCs) and community health centres (CHCs). The officers will also create awareness among villagers through information-education-communication (IEC) regarding preventive measures, symptom of the disease and early examination by medical practitioners.  \"The department has identified 676 high-risk villages in Gorakhpur region where maximum cases of JE/AES have been reported. The district magistrates have been directed to launch sanitation drive in villages, organise awareness campaigns and carry out fogging to eliminate mosquitoes and mites which are the carriers of the virus Japanese encephalitis is a mosquito-transmitted virus, scrub typhus is a mite-transmitted rickettsial bacterium. - Mod.TY,\" she said.  Services of Christian Medical College (CMC) Vellore and PATH Foundation will be taken to train government doctors managing critical care units at the hospital.  The health department is also working to build confidence of government doctors at PHCs and CHCs.  It was found during the study that instead of handling patients, the doctors at health centres referred them to BRD Medical College. The aim is to reduce the burden of medical college which receives huge number of patients from Bihar and Nepal as well. The state government is improving facilities at district hospitals and CHCs.  \"The doctors have been asked to admit JE/AES patients to the hospital rather than referring them to medical college,\" she said.  Talking to HT, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said the state government had decided to seek the assistance of private doctors and members of the Indian Medical Association to check AES.  The unit of National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, located in Gorakhpur, will be strengthened to conduct research work.  Byline: Rajesh Kumar Singh   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  The determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_), and lychee fruit consumption. Recently, scrub typhus has been implicated in many AES cases. With the likelihood of multiple etiologies, a long-term and well integrated study will be required to determine the causes of AES. The plans mentioned above will expand and intensify surveillance. Laboratory support will be increased and a broad range or expertise will be added. The patient load in the BRD medical college will be reduced and the capability of district hospital and community health centers for patient treatment will be improved. One hopes that these integrated efforts will last long enough to provide an accurate diagnosis of what is causing AES and lead to some initiatives to better treat or to prevent cases.

A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam;\n- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however,\nhave suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be\neffective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and\noutbreak situations (63, 64). \"References\n\n57.

Date: Thu 31 Aug 2017. From: Michael J. Bangs (mbangs@fmi.com) (edited)   It stands to reason that the presence of _Anopheles farauti_ as the new entrant into New Caledonia is presumably recent. The nearest neighbor is Vanuatu, a malaria-endemic country that has but one anopheline species present in that island group, _Anopheles farauti_ sensu stricto, an effective malaria vector provided you add _Plasmodium_ to the mix.  _Anopheles farauti_ is one member of 8 known sibling species in the _Farauti_ Complex (closely related species that are morphologically identical, thus confounding accurate identification without the use of molecular techniques). It is by far the most widely distributed species in the complex in the southwest Pacific region (Maluku island group, eastern Indonesia to northern Australia, PNG, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu). The species' ability to inhabit brackish water environments (predominantly a coastal inhabitant) has aided in its dispersal throughout the region.  The origin of the anopheline population in New Caledonia might remain a mystery, but this discovery is of concern. If the area of establishment is relatively confined, it might be possible to eliminate this species before it extends further into the country. Foremost, identify the species.   Michael J. Bangs, MSPH, PhD. Public Health & Malaria Control International SOS Kuala Kencana, Papua, Indonesia (mbangs@fmi.com)  ProMED thanks Dr. Bangs for his comments.  The _Anopheles_ reported in the previous posting was found in an area of La Tontouta, north of Noumea. One hopes that the area of discovery is small enough to permit control.

Date: Thu 31 Aug 2017. From: Niamh O'Flaherty (Niamh.O'Flaherty@ibts.ie)   IBTS response to ProMED: Hepatitis B - Ireland - Thank you for giving the opportunity for The Irish Blood Transfusion Service (IBTS) to respond to your recent article and subsequent comments related to the first known case of HBV transmission through blood transfusion in Ireland.  The IBTS employ individual donation nucleic acid testing (ID- NAT) to screen every blood donation for blood-borne viruses (BBV) including HBV, using the Ultrio-Elite (UE) multiplex assay manufactured by Grifols/Hologic. Both the manufacturer and the IBTS have confirmed the assay has a limit of detection for HBV of the order of 4 IU/mL. In addition, in terms of screening for HBV markers we test for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen.  For clarification purposes, the transmission of HBV in this case was due to a donation obtained in the pre-ID NAT window period, when the level of HBV DNA in the donor's blood was below the limit of detection of even this extremely sensitive assay. The window period for the UE assay is of the order of just 15 days. The IBTS introduced ID NAT testing in 2009, in order to avail of this shorter window period and hence earliest possible detection of HBV infection. As mentioned in your comments, the serological window period is significantly longer.  A full investigation has been conducted into this case. During this investigation it was demonstrated that the assay performed within the expected level of sensitivity. In addition, the investigation demonstrated that all aspects of laboratory testing and donor screening were satisfactory. The IBTS will continue to employ the most advanced technologies and safest screening strategy available to maintain the safety of the blood supplied to the people of Ireland.   Dr. Niamh O'Flaherty Consultant Microbiologist Irish Blood Transfusion Service (Niamh.O'Flaherty@ibts.ie)  ProMED thanks Dr. O'Flaherty for the quick response. It seems that the \"serological window period\" when HBsAg disappears and anti-HBs has not appeared yet is not the issue here but rather the blood was transfused prior to the HBsAg becoming positive and anti-HBc has yet to be positive. Anti-HBc would be positive in the \"serological window\".  Although the Irish press has been somewhat reactive regarding this quite rare episode, clearly the Irish Blood Transfusion Service is not at fault at all here. - Mod.LL  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/39).

Date: Fri 1 Sep 2017. From: Antonio Battisti (antonio.battisti@izslt.it) (edited)   The diagnosis of Anthrax was done at Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale del Lazio e della Toscana (IZSLT), in Rome, Italy (same province of the outbreak) after an onsite inspection by vets from IZSLT who were called by the Local Veterinary Services, on Fri 25 Aug 2017.  During the inspection, IZSLT decided that Anthrax was the main etiology to be firstly investigated. Four bovine animals found dead at inspection site (a pasture in the municipality of Grottaferrata, province of Rome, Italy), most probably dead in the latter 4-5 hours, were sampled (blood samples, following the international consensus procedures). The Veterinary Services disposed of fallen stock (destruction) according to EU legislation (the 4 animals plus another one that was found dead nearby by the Veterinary Services).  All 4 cases investigated were preliminarly diagnosed as Anthrax cases on the same day, by microscopic examination of blood smears stained with polychrome methylene blue (McFedyan's reaction), and confirmed by cultures and PCR (chromosomal target, pXO1 and pXO2 plasmidic targets) by the next Mon 28 Aug 2017. These are the only cases that were confirmed as Anthrax by a laboratory diagnosis.  The area is an historical Anthrax site and pastures are located in the crater of an extinct volcano, not far from the Albano Lake, itself a lake of volcanic origin. Anthrax cases in livestock living in the area are considered absolutely sporadic nowadays, thanks to the intense vaccine prevention measures of the past decades (from the late 1950s of the 20th century). The outbreak may have been favored by the severe drought ongoing in Central Italy. This is the only outbreak notified in 2017 in the Latium Region.

The\nfollowing is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In:\nChronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract.\nGreydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in\npress): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons,\nvaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside\nof Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as\n60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection\nlengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:\n- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam;\n- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however,\nhave suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be\neffective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and\noutbreak situations (63, 64). \"References\n\n57.

NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in\npress): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons,\nvaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside\nof Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as\n60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection\nlengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:\n- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam;\n- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however,\nhave suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be\neffective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and\noutbreak situations (63, 64). \"References\n\n57.

Date: Thu 31 Aug 2017. From: Michael J. Bangs (mbangs@fmi.com) (edited)   It stands to reason that the presence of _Anopheles farauti_ as the new entrant into New Caledonia is presumably recent. The nearest neighbor is Vanuatu, a malaria-endemic country that has but one anopheline species present in that island group, _Anopheles farauti_ sensu stricto, an effective malaria vector provided you add _Plasmodium_ to the mix.  _Anopheles farauti_ is one member of 8 known sibling species in the _Farauti_ Complex (closely related species that are morphologically identical, thus confounding accurate identification without the use of molecular techniques). It is by far the most widely distributed species in the complex in the southwest Pacific region (Maluku island group, eastern Indonesia to northern Australia, PNG, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu). The species' ability to inhabit brackish water environments (predominantly a coastal inhabitant) has aided in its dispersal throughout the region.  The origin of the anopheline population in New Caledonia might remain a mystery, but this discovery is of concern. If the area of establishment is relatively confined, it might be possible to eliminate this species before it extends further into the country. Foremost, identify the species.   Michael J. Bangs, MSPH, PhD. Public Health & Malaria Control International SOS Kuala Kencana, Papua, Indonesia (mbangs@fmi.com)  ProMED thanks Dr. Bangs for his comments.  The _Anopheles_ reported in the previous posting was found in an area of La Tontouta, north of Noumea. One hopes that the area of discovery is small enough to permit control.

The meeting was attended by the national teams as well as the staff from the southern region of Afghanistan and Balochistan province of Pakistan.  - Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: Pakistan: 2 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) environmental positive samples; Syria: 6 new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases; and, DR Congo: 1 new cVDPV2 case. Additionally, pre-notification was received this week of a new WPV1 case from Karachi, Pakistan, the 1st in Karachi since January 2016. The case will be officially reflected in next week's global data reporting.  Afghanistan  - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 6. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 10 Jul 2017, from Zabul province, neighbouring Kandahar province and Pakistan. - Preparations continue for a targeted vaccination round in the southern region of the country, scheduled on 11 Sep 2017  Pakistan  - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week; the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 3. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 11 Jun 2017, from Killa Abdullah, Balochistan. - Two new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) environmental positive samples were reported in the past week, from Karachi, Sindh (collected on 7 and 12 Aug 2017). - Additionally, pre-notification was received this week of a new WPV1 case from Karachi, Pakistan. The case will be officially reflected in next week's global data reporting. Karachi had previously been a key reservoir for WPV1 in Pakistan. Analysis is ongoing to determine the origin of this latest case and a response is being planned. The case had onset of paralysis on 11 Aug 2017. The last previous case from Karachi is from January 2016. - The National Task Force for Polio Eradication convened last week, chaired by the Prime Minister of Pakistan and attended by the senior leadership from the national and provincial levels. The Task force reviewed the revised National Emergency Action Plan 2017/18 and discussed mechanisms of accelerating the implementation of strategies to stop WPV1 transmission in the key hot spots. - Under the National Emergency Action Plan for polio eradication, the country is planning to implement 2 nation-wide and 2 sub-national vaccination rounds from September to December 2017.  Nigeria - - No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 21 Aug 2016 in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno. - Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and cVDPV2 strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016). - Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance.  Lake Chad Basin  - The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno, Nigeria in 2016) and cVDPV2 (Borno and Sokoto provinces in Nigeria in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak. - Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.  Central Africa  - One new case of cVDPV2 was reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), from Haut Lomami province, with onset of paralysis on 20 Jun 2017. The total number of cVDPV2 cases this year 2017 is now 8, in 2 separate outbreaks: in Haut Lomami province (6 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on 20 Jun 2017); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on 26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017, with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May 2017). - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time. Outbreak response is taking place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols, targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 across the 2 provinces. \n- The 1st mOPV2 round was implemented on 27-29 Jun 2017 in the 2 affected provinces; and the 2nd mOPV2 round ran from 13-15 Jul 2017 in Haut Lomami and 20-22 Jul 2017 in Maniema. - Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.  Middle East  - In Syria, 6 new cases of cVDPV2 were officially reported in the past week from Deir-Ez-Zour governorate, bringing the total number of cases in this outbreak to 39. Onset of paralysis of these cases is between 3 Mar 2017 and 10 Jul 2017. The bulk of all cases are from Deir-Ez-Zour, the epicentre of this outbreak. - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized and implemented, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Two vaccination campaigns are planned for both Deir-Ez-Zour and Raqqa governorates. - The 1st mOPV2 round in Deir-Ez-Zour was successfully carried out between 22-26 Jul 2017. Independent post-campaign monitoring reflected coverage of 88.4 percent (based on caregiver recall). - The 2nd immunization round for Deir-Ez-Zor governorate started on 22 Aug 2017 and is ongoing. Monovalent OPV2 is being provided for children between 0-59 months of age, and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) for children 2-23 months. In addition to polio vaccines, Aqua Tabs are being provided to families for water purification - 2.5 tons of water purification tablets for 400 000 people have been disseminated at health centers. - Plans are being finalized to mitigate the risks of further spread from the outbreak zone to neighbouring areas and countries, including immunization of at-risk populations in northwest Syria, Turkey and Lebanon.

All confirmed cases to date have had onset of paralysis before 14 Jul 2017. - Final lab results are pending for an additional 5 poliovirus type-2 (PV2) isolates (3 from Mayadeen and 1 from Boukamal districts, Deir Ez-Zor governorate, and 1 from Thawra district, Raqqa governorate). - The 2nd immunization round for Deir Ez-Zor started on 22 Aug 2017 and is ongoing due to high levels of population movement in and out of the governorate during the round. - WHO has organized the redistribution of vaccines and mapping of population movements to increase reach. An additional 90 000 mOPV2 doses are being transported from Damascus to Deir Ez-Zor, to cater for population influxes from As-Sukhnah, Homs governorate, and Al-Qa'im in Iraq. Corrective measures are expected to extend the round by 2 days. - Preparations for the 2nd immunization round for Raqqa are underway. - The total number of AFP cases detected in Deir Ez-Zor governorate since the beginning of 2017 is 122 (91 from Mayadeen, 10 from Deir Ez-Zor, and 21 from Boukamal districts). Raqqa governorate has reported 16 AFP cases (5 from Raqqa, 10 from Tell Abyad, and 1 from Thawra districts). Homs governorate has reported 28 AFP cases (12 from Homs city, 13 from Rastan, 1 from Tadmour and 2 from Talkalakh districts).  more details on the vaccination activities and future plans are available at the source URL as well as the epidemic curve and graphic representation of the vaccination status of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis cases by governorate and district. - Mod.MPP   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  In the above global summary, there is still identified transmission ongoing in Pakistan as seen by the positive environmental sample in Karachi as well as the early report on a case of WPV1 associated disease in Karachi. It will be interesting to learn of the genetic profile of the environmental isolates in Karachi (from this past week as well as from a few weeks ago) and compare them with the newly identified WPV1 associated case in Karachi to see if they are genetically related.  There has been more activity associated with cVDPV2 in both Syria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), with 6 newly confirmed cases in Syria and 1 newly confirmed case in the DR Congo. According to the Situation Report in section <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> above, there are still 5 additional PV2 (poliovirus type 2) isolates in Syria undergoing final testing  4 from Deir al Zour and 1 from Raqqa. Hence there will probably be more cases confirmed in the coming days or weeks. I have not been able to identify similar report information from the DR Congo outbreak so it is not clear if the transmission has been interrupted leaving a total of 8 cases, or if there are still probable cases pending confirmation.

According to Oscar Endekwa, the County Director for Public\nHealth, 21 cholera cases have been reported in the county. Speaking to Nation in his office in Hola, Dr Endekwa said the\nsituation at the NYS camp was under control. \"The officers are\nresponding well to treatment. The other case is of a resident and he\nhas been placed under treatment,\" he said. He added that the symptoms\nwere noted on August 30, though they had not been confirmed, adding\nthat health officials are investigating the cause of the disease. Besides isolating victims, Dr Endekwa said the county is also\nsensitizing residents on hygiene and sanitation. \"We are trying to\ncombat it before it spreads to a larger population,\" he added. He\nasked residents to report any suspicious cases and urged them to drink\nclean water and wash their hands after visiting toilets. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{4}</strong> Cholera - Nigeria (Borno state) IDPs.\nDate: Mon 4 Sep 2017 2:10 AM WAT.\nSource: Daily Trust (edited)\n(https://www.dailytrust.com.ng/cholera-outbreak-kills-7-idps-in-borno.html) \nOn 3 Sep 2017, 7 internally displaced persons (IDPs) were confirmed\ndead as a result of a cholera outbreak at some IDP camps in Borno\nState This came just 3 weeks after about 100 others were discharged\nfrom Muna and Dala Lawanti Cholera treatment centers. The Médecins\nSans Frontières (MSF) in Maiduguri said the cholera outbreak was due\nto downpours in the last 3 days that caused flood at the affected IDP\ncamps. The Commissioner of Health in the state, Dr Haruna Mshelia said\nmeasures had been taken to contain it from further spread. \"I cannot\ntell you the death toll, as I continue to visit all camps in Maiduguri\nand ensure that the epidemic does not further spread to claim more\nlives,\" he said. One of the rescue workers at Muna Garage IDP camp told newsmen that\nfor only yesterday 3 Sep 2017, they had admitted over 50 patients. \"We have holistic measures to address this cholera outbreak urgently\nalthough people are dying day by day. More than 100 people are\naffected so far, and 51 people were admitted. In the last 24 hours, we\nhave received over 50 patients at MSF's Cholera Treatment Unit at\nDala.

The\nfollowing is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In:\nChronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract.\nGreydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in\npress): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons,\nvaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside\nof Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as\n60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection\nlengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:\n- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam;\n- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however,\nhave suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be\neffective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and\noutbreak situations (63, 64). \"References\n\n57.

The meeting was attended by the national teams as well as the staff from the southern region of Afghanistan and Balochistan province of Pakistan.  - Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: Pakistan: 2 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) environmental positive samples; Syria: 6 new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases; and, DR Congo: 1 new cVDPV2 case. Additionally, pre-notification was received this week of a new WPV1 case from Karachi, Pakistan, the 1st in Karachi since January 2016. The case will be officially reflected in next week's global data reporting.  Afghanistan  - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 6. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 10 Jul 2017, from Zabul province, neighbouring Kandahar province and Pakistan. - Preparations continue for a targeted vaccination round in the southern region of the country, scheduled on 11 Sep 2017  Pakistan  - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week; the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 3. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 11 Jun 2017, from Killa Abdullah, Balochistan. - Two new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) environmental positive samples were reported in the past week, from Karachi, Sindh (collected on 7 and 12 Aug 2017). - Additionally, pre-notification was received this week of a new WPV1 case from Karachi, Pakistan. The case will be officially reflected in next week's global data reporting. Karachi had previously been a key reservoir for WPV1 in Pakistan. Analysis is ongoing to determine the origin of this latest case and a response is being planned. The case had onset of paralysis on 11 Aug 2017. The last previous case from Karachi is from January 2016. - The National Task Force for Polio Eradication convened last week, chaired by the Prime Minister of Pakistan and attended by the senior leadership from the national and provincial levels. The Task force reviewed the revised National Emergency Action Plan 2017/18 and discussed mechanisms of accelerating the implementation of strategies to stop WPV1 transmission in the key hot spots. - Under the National Emergency Action Plan for polio eradication, the country is planning to implement 2 nation-wide and 2 sub-national vaccination rounds from September to December 2017.  Nigeria - - No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 21 Aug 2016 in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno. - Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and cVDPV2 strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016). - Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance.  Lake Chad Basin  - The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno, Nigeria in 2016) and cVDPV2 (Borno and Sokoto provinces in Nigeria in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak. - Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.  Central Africa  - One new case of cVDPV2 was reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), from Haut Lomami province, with onset of paralysis on 20 Jun 2017. The total number of cVDPV2 cases this year 2017 is now 8, in 2 separate outbreaks: in Haut Lomami province (6 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on 20 Jun 2017); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on 26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017, with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May 2017). - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time. Outbreak response is taking place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols, targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 across the 2 provinces. \n- The 1st mOPV2 round was implemented on 27-29 Jun 2017 in the 2 affected provinces; and the 2nd mOPV2 round ran from 13-15 Jul 2017 in Haut Lomami and 20-22 Jul 2017 in Maniema. - Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.  Middle East  - In Syria, 6 new cases of cVDPV2 were officially reported in the past week from Deir-Ez-Zour governorate, bringing the total number of cases in this outbreak to 39. Onset of paralysis of these cases is between 3 Mar 2017 and 10 Jul 2017. The bulk of all cases are from Deir-Ez-Zour, the epicentre of this outbreak. - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized and implemented, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Two vaccination campaigns are planned for both Deir-Ez-Zour and Raqqa governorates. - The 1st mOPV2 round in Deir-Ez-Zour was successfully carried out between 22-26 Jul 2017. Independent post-campaign monitoring reflected coverage of 88.4 percent (based on caregiver recall). - The 2nd immunization round for Deir-Ez-Zor governorate started on 22 Aug 2017 and is ongoing. Monovalent OPV2 is being provided for children between 0-59 months of age, and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) for children 2-23 months. In addition to polio vaccines, Aqua Tabs are being provided to families for water purification - 2.5 tons of water purification tablets for 400 000 people have been disseminated at health centers. - Plans are being finalized to mitigate the risks of further spread from the outbreak zone to neighbouring areas and countries, including immunization of at-risk populations in northwest Syria, Turkey and Lebanon.

Corrective measures are expected to extend the round by 2 days. - Preparations for the 2nd immunization round for Raqqa are underway. - The total number of AFP cases detected in Deir Ez-Zor governorate since the beginning of 2017 is 122 (91 from Mayadeen, 10 from Deir Ez-Zor, and 21 from Boukamal districts). Raqqa governorate has reported 16 AFP cases (5 from Raqqa, 10 from Tell Abyad, and 1 from Thawra districts). Homs governorate has reported 28 AFP cases (12 from Homs city, 13 from Rastan, 1 from Tadmour and 2 from Talkalakh districts).  more details on the vaccination activities and future plans are available at the source URL as well as the epidemic curve and graphic representation of the vaccination status of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis cases by governorate and district. - Mod.MPP   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  In the above global summary, there is still identified transmission ongoing in Pakistan as seen by the positive environmental sample in Karachi as well as the early report on a case of WPV1 associated disease in Karachi. It will be interesting to learn of the genetic profile of the environmental isolates in Karachi (from this past week as well as from a few weeks ago) and compare them with the newly identified WPV1 associated case in Karachi to see if they are genetically related.  There has been more activity associated with cVDPV2 in both Syria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), with 6 newly confirmed cases in Syria and 1 newly confirmed case in the DR Congo. According to the Situation Report in section <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> above, there are still 5 additional PV2 (poliovirus type 2) isolates in Syria undergoing final testing  4 from Deir al Zour and 1 from Raqqa. Hence there will probably be more cases confirmed in the coming days or weeks. I have not been able to identify similar report information from the DR Congo outbreak so it is not clear if the transmission has been interrupted leaving a total of 8 cases, or if there are still probable cases pending confirmation.

According to the latest disease surveillance report of the DOH, 910 leptospirosis cases were recorded from 1 Jan to 5 Aug 2017. \"This is 71.1 percent higher compared to what was recorded in the same period as last year 2016, which was 532,\" said the DOH report.  Leptospirosis is an infectious disease caused by the _Leptospira interrogans_ bacteria. The leptospira bacteria are transmitted through wounds when in contact with floodwaters, vegetation, and moist soil contaminated with the urine of infected animals, especially rats. Leptospirosis is characterized by fever, muscle pain, reddish-yellowish body discoloration, dark-colored urine, light stools, low urine output, and severe headache.  There was also a higher number of deaths; with 96 or a 10.55 percent case fatality rate. In the same period last year 2016, there were only 50 deaths or 9.40 percent case fatality rate.  The majority of the leptospirosis cases were recorded in the National Capital Region with 172 cases; Davao Region with 112 cases; Western Visayas with 98; Central Luzon with 80; and Eastern Visayas with 72. Regions with the highest increase in cases were Eastern Visayas with 620 percent increase; Davao Region with 558 percent increase; Central Visayas with 390 percent increase; Caraga with 240 percent increase; and Cagayan Valley with 103 percent increase.  \nByline: Charina Clarisse Echaluce   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Currently, the Philippines is divided into 17 regions (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_the_Philippines). A map showing the regions of the Philippines can be found at: (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Labelled_map_of_the_Philippines_-_Provinces_and_Regions.png).  Leptospirosis is an infection transmitted to humans by exposure to soil or fresh water contaminated with the urine of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rodents) that are chronically infected with pathogenic _Leptospira_. The spirochete _Leptospira_ may survive in contaminated fresh water or moist soil for weeks to months.

However, it is summarized\nbelow: The Dansk Supermarket Group (DSG) recalled cold-packed smoked salmon,\nmanufactured in Poland, after _Listeria monocytogenes_ was identified\nin the product. The isolate from the product was almost identical by\nwhole genome sequencing to isolates from 3 of 4 patients, whose food\nhistory in 3 of the patients identified the smoked salmon as the\nlikely source. The smoked salmon product was recalled from about 600 stores in\nDenmark and a limited number in Metro Poland. Up to 3 of the 4 patients had become ill in the same week in August\n2017 and the 4th had become ill in May 2017. One of the 4 patients has\ndied. All 4 patients had severe underlying disease. DSG consists of chains (fotex, Bilka, Netto, and Salling) with more\nthan 1400 stores in Denmark, Germany, Poland and Sweden. Refrigerated smoked salmon is a recognized potential source for\nlisteriosis, similar to other cold cut meats and non-heat treated\ncured smoked meats, being a ready-to-eat product that does not require\nfurther cooking before eating. The news report said that more cases\nrelated to this outbreak were expected, despite the recall, as the\nincubation period for listeriosis is up to 3 weeks actually symptoms\ncan start up to as 70 days after exposure. - Mod.ML A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at:\n(http://healthmap.org/promed/p/113).

Half of the deaths were registered in Bucharest, with the other 3 being reported in Buzau, Braila, and Olt.  \"The Ministry of Health emphasizes that all these cases, detected and registered in Romania, are sporadic cases and don't pose the risk of a large epidemic,\" reads the Ministry's press release.

Most people infected with this virus will have no symptoms, and about one in 5 individuals who are infected will develop a fever with other symptoms, according to information posted on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website.  Doctors recommend people to reduce the risk of getting infected by using insect repellent and wearing protective clothing to prevent mosquito bites.

The Health Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu said the officers were in\nstable condition. Dr Mailu said investigations were underway to\nestablish whether the canteen had outsourced services to cater for the\nlarge number of officers. He said the ministry was concerned that\ninstead of eliminating cholera, new cases were emerging. Nairobi was first hit by the outbreak on 19 May 2017, with 56 cases\nhaving been reported. One of the police officers who requested anonymity said they ate ugali\n(a Kenyan staple made of maize flour) and meat stew at the canteen on\nSat 2 Sep 2017.

NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in\npress): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons,\nvaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside\nof Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as\n60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection\nlengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:\n- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam;\n- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however,\nhave suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be\neffective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and\noutbreak situations (63, 64). \"References\n\n57.

The\nfollowing is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In:\nChronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract.\nGreydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in\npress): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons,\nvaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside\nof Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as\n60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection\nlengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:\n- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam;\n- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however,\nhave suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be\neffective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and\noutbreak situations (63, 64). \"References\n\n57.

The\nfollowing is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In:\nChronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract.\nGreydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in\npress): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons,\nvaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside\nof Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as\n60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection\nlengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:\n- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam;\n- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however,\nhave suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be\neffective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and\noutbreak situations (63, 64). \"References\n\n57.

The\nfollowing is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In:\nChronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract.\nGreydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in\npress): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons,\nvaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside\nof Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as\n60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection\nlengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:\n- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam;\n- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however,\nhave suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be\neffective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and\noutbreak situations (63, 64). \"References\n\n57.

The meeting was attended by the national teams as well as the staff from the southern region of Afghanistan and Balochistan province of Pakistan.  - Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: Pakistan: 2 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) environmental positive samples; Syria: 6 new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases; and, DR Congo: 1 new cVDPV2 case. Additionally, pre-notification was received this week of a new WPV1 case from Karachi, Pakistan, the 1st in Karachi since January 2016. The case will be officially reflected in next week's global data reporting.  Afghanistan  - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 6. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 10 Jul 2017, from Zabul province, neighbouring Kandahar province and Pakistan. - Preparations continue for a targeted vaccination round in the southern region of the country, scheduled on 11 Sep 2017  Pakistan  - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week; the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 3. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 11 Jun 2017, from Killa Abdullah, Balochistan. - Two new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) environmental positive samples were reported in the past week, from Karachi, Sindh (collected on 7 and 12 Aug 2017). - Additionally, pre-notification was received this week of a new WPV1 case from Karachi, Pakistan. The case will be officially reflected in next week's global data reporting. Karachi had previously been a key reservoir for WPV1 in Pakistan. Analysis is ongoing to determine the origin of this latest case and a response is being planned. The case had onset of paralysis on 11 Aug 2017. The last previous case from Karachi is from January 2016. - The National Task Force for Polio Eradication convened last week, chaired by the Prime Minister of Pakistan and attended by the senior leadership from the national and provincial levels. The Task force reviewed the revised National Emergency Action Plan 2017/18 and discussed mechanisms of accelerating the implementation of strategies to stop WPV1 transmission in the key hot spots. - Under the National Emergency Action Plan for polio eradication, the country is planning to implement 2 nation-wide and 2 sub-national vaccination rounds from September to December 2017.  Nigeria - - No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 21 Aug 2016 in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno. - Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and cVDPV2 strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016). - Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance.  Lake Chad Basin  - The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno, Nigeria in 2016) and cVDPV2 (Borno and Sokoto provinces in Nigeria in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak. - Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.  Central Africa  - One new case of cVDPV2 was reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), from Haut Lomami province, with onset of paralysis on 20 Jun 2017. The total number of cVDPV2 cases this year 2017 is now 8, in 2 separate outbreaks: in Haut Lomami province (6 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on 20 Jun 2017); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on 26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017, with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May 2017). - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time. Outbreak response is taking place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols, targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 across the 2 provinces. \n- The 1st mOPV2 round was implemented on 27-29 Jun 2017 in the 2 affected provinces; and the 2nd mOPV2 round ran from 13-15 Jul 2017 in Haut Lomami and 20-22 Jul 2017 in Maniema. - Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.  Middle East  - In Syria, 6 new cases of cVDPV2 were officially reported in the past week from Deir-Ez-Zour governorate, bringing the total number of cases in this outbreak to 39. Onset of paralysis of these cases is between 3 Mar 2017 and 10 Jul 2017. The bulk of all cases are from Deir-Ez-Zour, the epicentre of this outbreak. - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized and implemented, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Two vaccination campaigns are planned for both Deir-Ez-Zour and Raqqa governorates. - The 1st mOPV2 round in Deir-Ez-Zour was successfully carried out between 22-26 Jul 2017. Independent post-campaign monitoring reflected coverage of 88.4 percent (based on caregiver recall). - The 2nd immunization round for Deir-Ez-Zor governorate started on 22 Aug 2017 and is ongoing. Monovalent OPV2 is being provided for children between 0-59 months of age, and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) for children 2-23 months. In addition to polio vaccines, Aqua Tabs are being provided to families for water purification - 2.5 tons of water purification tablets for 400 000 people have been disseminated at health centers. - Plans are being finalized to mitigate the risks of further spread from the outbreak zone to neighbouring areas and countries, including immunization of at-risk populations in northwest Syria, Turkey and Lebanon.

All confirmed cases to date have had onset of paralysis before 14 Jul 2017. - Final lab results are pending for an additional 5 poliovirus type-2 (PV2) isolates (3 from Mayadeen and 1 from Boukamal districts, Deir Ez-Zor governorate, and 1 from Thawra district, Raqqa governorate). - The 2nd immunization round for Deir Ez-Zor started on 22 Aug 2017 and is ongoing due to high levels of population movement in and out of the governorate during the round. - WHO has organized the redistribution of vaccines and mapping of population movements to increase reach. An additional 90 000 mOPV2 doses are being transported from Damascus to Deir Ez-Zor, to cater for population influxes from As-Sukhnah, Homs governorate, and Al-Qa'im in Iraq. Corrective measures are expected to extend the round by 2 days. - Preparations for the 2nd immunization round for Raqqa are underway. - The total number of AFP cases detected in Deir Ez-Zor governorate since the beginning of 2017 is 122 (91 from Mayadeen, 10 from Deir Ez-Zor, and 21 from Boukamal districts). Raqqa governorate has reported 16 AFP cases (5 from Raqqa, 10 from Tell Abyad, and 1 from Thawra districts). Homs governorate has reported 28 AFP cases (12 from Homs city, 13 from Rastan, 1 from Tadmour and 2 from Talkalakh districts).  more details on the vaccination activities and future plans are available at the source URL as well as the epidemic curve and graphic representation of the vaccination status of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis cases by governorate and district. - Mod.MPP   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  In the above global summary, there is still identified transmission ongoing in Pakistan as seen by the positive environmental sample in Karachi as well as the early report on a case of WPV1 associated disease in Karachi. It will be interesting to learn of the genetic profile of the environmental isolates in Karachi (from this past week as well as from a few weeks ago) and compare them with the newly identified WPV1 associated case in Karachi to see if they are genetically related.  There has been more activity associated with cVDPV2 in both Syria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), with 6 newly confirmed cases in Syria and 1 newly confirmed case in the DR Congo. According to the Situation Report in section <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> above, there are still 5 additional PV2 (poliovirus type 2) isolates in Syria undergoing final testing  4 from Deir al Zour and 1 from Raqqa. Hence there will probably be more cases confirmed in the coming days or weeks. I have not been able to identify similar report information from the DR Congo outbreak so it is not clear if the transmission has been interrupted leaving a total of 8 cases, or if there are still probable cases pending confirmation.

According to the Health ministry, the\nofficers are said to have been infected after taking meals at the\nNairobi Area Police Canteen. On Sun 3 Sep 2017, some 59 officers were hospitalised in various\nhospitals in Nairobi with another 36 admitted Mon 4 Sep 2017, after\ncontracting the disease. They were part of a group of 430 officers\ndeployed to Nairobi ahead of the Supreme Court ruling on presidential\npoll petition on Fri 1 Sep 2017. They were residing at the\nMultimedia University Hotel in Rongai, about 17 kilometers 10.6 mi\nsouth of the capital. \"Those infected did not get the disease from the Multimedia University\nsince they had their lunch away from the institution.

The\nfollowing is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In:\nChronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract.\nGreydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in\npress): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons,\nvaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside\nof Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as\n60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection\nlengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:\n- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam;\n- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however,\nhave suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be\neffective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and\noutbreak situations (63, 64). \"References\n\n57.

NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in\npress): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons,\nvaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside\nof Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as\n60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection\nlengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:\n- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam;\n- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses.

The total amount of dead wild boars discovered in the woods around\nZlín, in the far east of the Czech Republic, stood at 94 at the end\nof August 2017. In this month, 23 new infected carcasses were found,\nwhich is a downward trend from July 2017, when 68 reports were sent\nto the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). The 1st report of\nASF in Czech wild boars was on Wed 21 Jun 2017. Many neighbouring countries have alerted their local pig producers to\nbe very careful what to feed their pigs - and their inhabitants what\nto purchase and how to dispose of it. So did Slovakia, according to\nthe Slovak Spectator. Zlín is only a few km away from the western\nSlovak border, to its north is Poland where ASF has been around since\n2014 and on its eastern border is Ukraine, where ASF has been\nconfirmed since 2011. In a presentation, given in mid-July 2017 to the European\nCommission's Standing Committee On Animals, Plants, Food and Feed\n(SCoPAFF), Dr Petr Šatrán of the Czech State Veterinary\nAdministration indicated that human activities are most likely the\ncause of the spread of the virus, seeing that the nearest reported\ncases of ASF were roughly 500 km 310.68 mi away and that the\npositive dead wild boars were found in inhabited areas. In the other country where ASF was found for the 1st time in 2017,\nRomania, things appear relatively quiet. News broke early this month\nAugust 2017 that ASF was also found on 2 backyard farms in the north\nof the country. Ever since, the Romanian authorities did not report\nany further outbreaks of ASF to the OIE. Of all other countries in the European Union, especially Poland has\ncontinued to report outbreaks of African Swine Fever in smaller and\nmiddle-sized operations. In August alone, on 23 farm sites of various\nsizes, ASF was found to have infected at least one animal, after which\nthe entire herd would have to be culled. The biggest operation in this respect was a farm near Monki, Podlaskie\nprovince, where all remaining 431 pigs had to be culled after 11 had\ndied as a result of ASF, on Sat 19 Aug 2017. Noteworthy as well was\nthe ASF-related closure of 2 farms in Lack, Lubelskie province, in\nearly August. These farms had 136 and 141 pigs respectively see also\nitem 2.

This was said by Poland's Minister of Agriculture,\nKrzysztof Yurgel, Niezalezna reports. As reported, the length of the fence will be 729 km 452.98 mi,\ncosting Poland 130 million zloties (more than 36.2 million USD). The\nfinal decision on a fence will be made within the next 3 weeks. According to experts, ASF has developed in the territory of Poland\n\"thanks to\" the wild boars who entered from Belarus. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) The accumulated ASF OIE data from Poland as of Thu 31 Aug 2017, are\nas follows (start of event 22 May 2014):\nNumber of follow-up reports: 189\nTotal outbreaks: 550 (Submitted)\nSpecies/ Susceptible/ Cases/ Deaths/ Killed and disposed of/\nSlaughtered\nWild boar/ - / 620 / 620 / 0 / 0\nDomestic Swine/ 6303/ 402/ 188/ 6097/ 0 A map showing ASF cases reported globally to the OIE since 1 Jan 2017,\nas of Thu 31 Aug 2017, is available at (http://tinyurl.com/ybexasqm).\nClick on the European cluster, zoom in to each of the countries of\ninterest. EU disease control measures require designation of risk areas as Part\nI (wild boar at risk, but no cases found), Part II (wild boar testing\npositive but no spill over into domestic pigs), Part III (cases in\nwild boar and occasional spill over into domestic pigs) and Part IV\nwhich concerns the island of Sardinia only. Consignments of live pigs,\nlive wild boars, meat of either source and animal by-products of\neither source are only allowed under certain derogations. For a full\nexplanation, see European Commission Implementing Decision\n2014/708/EU. ASF, a viral disease against which no vaccine has become available so\nfar, is currently threatening central and western Europe, where dense\npopulations of wild boar are present. According to a recent update of DEFRA (UK) ASF situation assessment,\nthe continuing cases in the Czech Republic, the spread in Poland which\nappears to be due to several breakdowns in biosecurity and the new\noutbreaks in Romania are \"concerning\". This signifies a spread in\ngeographic distribution, a possible drop in biosecurity awareness and\ntherefore an increase in the weight of infection in East Europe. Despite the relatively low level of trade in live pigs, there could be\na substantial movement of people, vehicles and personal imports of\npork products, therefore the risk of ASF introduction to the UK has\nbeen raised from \"very low\" (that is, \"rare but could occur\") to\n\"low\". The Russian veterinary watchdog Rosselkhoznadzor believes ASF will\nkeep moving west via 2 main pathways. The southerly route, has already\nseen the virus spread from Ukraine to Moldova. Russian vets believe it\ncould penetrate central Romania, then move to the Balkans, including\nBulgaria and Serbia. On the northern route, now that ASF has been found in the Czech\nRepublic, Rosselkhoznadzor believes, if it gains a foothold, it is\nlikely to head further west, with Germany next in the firing line. The\nsaid is included in a recent update by the Russian journalist\nVladislav Vorotnikov, available at\n(http://www.pig-world.co.uk/comment/where-next-for-african-swine-fever.html).\n- Mod.AS ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"United Arab Emirates":{},"United Kingdom":{},"United States of America":{"180":{"title":"Eastern equine encephalitis - USA (08): (GA, OH) equine\r\n\t","date":["31","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH/EDR> Eastern equine encephalitis - USA (08): (GA, OH) equine\r\n\t[EXTERNAL]","summary":" A ProMED-mail post (http://www.promedmail.org) ProMED-mail is a program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases (http://www.isid.org)  In this update: <br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Georgia <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Ohio   <br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Georgia.

Date: Thu 31 Aug 2017. From: Michael J. Bangs (mbangs@fmi.com) (edited)   It stands to reason that the presence of _Anopheles farauti_ as the new entrant into New Caledonia is presumably recent. The nearest neighbor is Vanuatu, a malaria-endemic country that has but one anopheline species present in that island group, _Anopheles farauti_ sensu stricto, an effective malaria vector provided you add _Plasmodium_ to the mix.  _Anopheles farauti_ is one member of 8 known sibling species in the _Farauti_ Complex (closely related species that are morphologically identical, thus confounding accurate identification without the use of molecular techniques). It is by far the most widely distributed species in the complex in the southwest Pacific region (Maluku island group, eastern Indonesia to northern Australia, PNG, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu). The species' ability to inhabit brackish water environments (predominantly a coastal inhabitant) has aided in its dispersal throughout the region.  The origin of the anopheline population in New Caledonia might remain a mystery, but this discovery is of concern. If the area of establishment is relatively confined, it might be possible to eliminate this species before it extends further into the country. Foremost, identify the species.   Michael J. Bangs, MSPH, PhD. Public Health & Malaria Control International SOS Kuala Kencana, Papua, Indonesia (mbangs@fmi.com)  ProMED thanks Dr. Bangs for his comments.  The _Anopheles_ reported in the previous posting was found in an area of La Tontouta, north of Noumea. One hopes that the area of discovery is small enough to permit control.
