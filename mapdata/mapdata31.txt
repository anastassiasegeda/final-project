We continue to work together to advance shared priorities, including governance and democracy, regional security, poverty reduction, polio eradication, trade, defense, and the fight against climate change.\" - The 14th Emergency Committee for polio eradication under the International Health Regulations met on 3 Aug 2017 and has made its recommendations to the WHO Director-General, who has accepted them. The Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and recommended the extension of revised Temporary Recommendations for a further 3 months. The key change is the inclusion of DR Congo and Syria in the category 'States infected with cVDPV2s, with potential risk of international spread'. - Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: Afghanistan: 1 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case; Pakistan: 1 new WPV1-positive environmental sample; Syrian Arab Republic: 3 new circulating vaccine-derived polio type 2 (cVDPV2) from Syria, 2 from Deir ez-Zor and 1 from Homs governorates.

It is the most recent case in the country, and had onset of paralysis on 10 Jul 2017, from Zabul province, neighbouring Kandahar province and Pakistan. - Afghanistan continues to coordinate activities with neighbouring Pakistan, to address both cross-border transmission and focus on reaching mobile populations with oral polio vaccine (OPV). Transmission linking both countries runs primarily across 3 corridors, namely: eastern Afghanistan and Khyber-Peshawar, Pakistan; greater Kandahar/Helmand and Quetta, Pakistan; and, Paktika/Patkya/Khost and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa/Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Pakistan.<br><br><strong> Pakistan </strong><br> - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week; the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 3.

The total number of cVDPV2 cases this year 2017 remains 7, in 2 separate outbreaks: in Haut Lomami province (5 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on 13 Jun 2017); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on 26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017, with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May 2017). - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time. Outbreak response is taking place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols, targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 across the 2 provinces. - The 1st mOPV2 round was implemented on 27-29 Jun 2017 in the 2 affected provinces; and the 2nd mOPV2 round ran from 13-15 Jul 2017 in Haut Lomami and 20-22 Jul 2017 in Maniema. - Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.<br><br><strong> Middle East -</strong><br> - In Syria, 3 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were officially reported in the past week. The total number of cases in this outbreak is 33. Onset of paralysis of these cases is between 3 Mar 2017 and 10 Jul 2017. 31 of the cases are from Deir ez-Zor governorate (29 from Mayadeen district, one from Deir ez-Zor district, and one from Boukamal district); 1 case is from Talabyad district, Raqqa governorate; and, 1 is from Tadmour district in Homs governorate. - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized and implemented, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Two vaccination campaigns are planned for both Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa governorates. If there is geographic spread, the extent of these campaigns will have to be adjusted. - The 1st mOPV2 round in Deir ez-Zor was successfully carried out between 22-26 Jul 2017. Independent post-campaign monitoring reflected coverage of 88.4 percent (based on caregiver recall). The 2nd round is planned for 19-23 Aug 2017, and will include mOPV2 and IPV. - Raqqa Governorate started mOPV2 campaigns on 12 Aug 2017. - Plans are being finalized to mitigate the risks of further spread from the outbreak zone to neighbouring areas and countries, including immunization of at-risk populations in northwest Syria, Turkey and Lebanon. Following confirmation of the case in Homs, discussions are ongoing to further extend the geographic reach of the outbreak response.<br><br><strong> Officially reported wild poliovirus cases as of 15 Aug 2017 - Total global cases in 2017: 9 (compared with 21 for the same period in 2016) Total in endemic countries in 2017: 9 (compared with 21 for the same period in 2016) - Afghanistan: 6 cases in 2017 (compared with 6 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 10 Jul 2017 - Pakistan: 3 cases in 2017 (compared with 13 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 11 Jun 2017 - Nigeria: 0 cases in 2017 (compared with 2 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 21 Aug 2016 Total in non-endemic countries in 2017: 0 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016) Total global cases in 2016: 37 - Total in endemic countries: 37 - Total in non-endemic countries: 0 Officially reported cVDPV cases as of 15 Aug 2017 -</strong><br> Total global cases in 2017: 40 (compared with 3 for the same period in 2016) - Syrian Arab Republic: 33 cases in 2017 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 10 Jul 2017 - Democratic Republic of the Congo: 7 cases in 2017 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 13 Jun 2017 - Pakistan: 0 cases in 2017 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 17 Dec 2016 - Nigeria: 0 cases in 2017 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 28 Oct 2016 - Lao People's Democratic Republic: 0 case in 2017 (compared with 3 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 11 Jan 2016 Total global cases in 2016: 5 - Total in endemic countries: 2 - Total in non-endemic countries: 3  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail This week's global update is similar to prior weeks in terms of low level identification of WPV1 associated disease (a single case confirmed in Afghanistan this past week), one positive WPV1 isolated from an environmental sample in Pakistan, and 3 newly confirmed cVDPV2 associated cases in Syria. That being said, there have only been 9 confirmed cases of WPV1 associated paralytic disease worldwide this year (2017), compared with 37 cases reported last year (2016). In contrast there have been 40 confirmed cases of cVDPV2 confirmed this year (2017) compared with 5 last year (2016). As a reminder, outbreaks due to cVDPV's are considered as significant in the big picture of polio eradication, as they are due to vaccine polioviruses that have reverted in neurovirulence following passage through multiple individuals while circulating in the susceptible population. The goal of the polio eradication initiative is to interrupt transmission of both the WPV's and the cVDPVs. The presence of cVDPVs occurs when there are areas with low vaccination coverage where the vaccine virus (from the OPV) can continue circulating through the susceptible population. - Mod.MPP ","keywordsMatched":[]},"452":{"title":"Poliomyelitis update (21): Syria (DY), Congo DR, cVDPV,\r\n\tglobal ","date":["10","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Poliomyelitis update (21): Syria (DY), Congo DR, cVDPV,\r\n\tglobal [EXTERNAL]","summary":"<br><br><strong>   Thu 10 Aug 2017 Source: Polio Eradication Initiative edited Poliovirus Weekly Update as of: 9 Aug 2017, World Health Organization -</strong><br> New wild poliovirus cases reported this week: 0 Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2017: 8 Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2016: 37 New cVDPV cases reported this week: 0 Total number of cVDPV cases in 2017: 37 Total number of cVDPV cases in 2016: 5 Headlines - The United Kingdom has announced 100 million in new funding to polio eradication to meet the final challenges. - Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: 2 positive environmental samples of wild poliovirus type 1 in Pakistan and 1 in Afghanistan; 3 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus in Syria and 3 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

According to this weekly update from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), there are 2 active transmission sites related to cVDPVs - one in Syria and the 2nd in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). Both are areas that have had transmission identified from earlier this year (2017). In the case of Syria, it appears that the transmission of the cVDPV has been localized to the Deir al Zour governorate with a single case having been reported from the neighboring Raqqah governorate (suggesting this may have been an isolated importation). To date there have been 30 cases of polio attributable to the cVDPV in Syria. In the case of the DR Congo, while cases had been identified in 2 provinces, it appears that circulation has continued in only one of the 2 provinces - Haut Lomami province. As the dates of onset of most recent confirmed cases in both Syria and the DR Congo are in mid-June, and control vaccination campaigns were begun in mid-July (in Syria) and late June and mid July (in the 2 affected provinces in the DR Congo), and we are now in early August, it would not be surprising to learn of additional cases over the coming weeks that were infected before the immunization campaigns were completed.. Also noteworthy in the above update is the identification of 2 WPV1 positive environmental samples in Karachi, Sindh Pakistan. The most recent reported (and confirmed) case of polio due to WPV1 in Sindh was in 2016. ( ).  So the identification of the WPV1 in environmental samples is of concern as it indicates an infected individual(s) has been in the area and might be a source for continued tranmission of the WPV1.. - Mod.MPP ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Albania":{},"Algeria":{},"American Samoa":{},"Andorra":{},"Angola":{"174":{"title":["Zika Virus in Angola"],"date":["08","August","2017"],"url":"wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/alert/zika-virus-angola","summary":"Mosquitoes that can spread Zika usually live in places below 6,500 feet.

Emerg Microbes Infect. 2017; 6(8): e69. doi: 10.1038/emi.2017.<br><br><strong>59  Abstract </strong><br> Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has recently been associated with an increased incidence of neonatal microcephaly and other neurological disorders. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito bite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some cases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main vector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other mosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the virus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit ZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of laboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. Interestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the midgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in Recife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially fed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx. quinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced. Collectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range of ZIKV vectors than anticipated.  <br><br>Communicated by: Roland Hübner Superior Health Council Brussels Belgium Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active virus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their ability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step toward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_ fed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in saliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing. The study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a competent vector. Several other studies have shown this species to be inefficient vectors or refractory to Zika virus infection. One wonders if the specific _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ used or the Zika virus isolates with which they were tested could account for these very different results. Resolving these discrepancies is important because this mosquito species is very widely distributed around the world and bears directly on risk of outbreaks in geographic areas where _Aedes aegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_ , Zika virus vectors, do not occur. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"91":{"title":"Chikungunya (27) - Americas, Europe, Asia ","date":["18","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Chikungunya (27) - Americas, Europe, Asia [EXTERNAL]","summary":"<br><br><strong> Cases in various countries: Regional summaries - Americas -</strong><br> WHO/PAHO report 18 Aug 2017 Reported cases of chikungunya fever in the Americas, by country or territory - 2017 to EW 33 week ending 18 Aug 2017.

TY  communicated by: ProMED-mail and Roland Hübner Superior Health Council Brussels Belgium The number of reported cases of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection in the Americas appears to have declined this year (2017). Given the outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections in the region, and the clinical similarity of cases of that virus infection and CHIKV infection, one wonders how many cases that were not laboratory confirmed but clinically diagnosed as ZIKV infections were, in reality, CHIKV infections. It is also possible that a significant proportion of the population have been infected by CHIKV in the previous 3 years and are now immune. It seems likely, however, that CHIKV is now endemic in the Americas, and sporadic, small outbreaks may continue to occur as they do in Asia and Africa. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"113":{"title":["Zika Virus in Argentina"],"date":["08","August","2017"],"url":"wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/alert/zika-virus-argentina","summary":"Mosquitoes that can spread Zika usually live in places below 6,500 feet.

BoNTs prevent neurotransmitter release and lead to a flaccid paralysis. There are 3 main forms of human botulism: food-borne, wound and infant botulism 1,2. The BoNTs are produced by 6 phylogenetically and physiologically distinct bacteria (_Clostridium botulinum_ Groups I-IV, and strains of _C. baratii_ and _C. butyricum_) which are so diverse as to merit classification as different species. All of the BoNT-producing _Clostridium_ species have non BoNT-producing counterparts (not harboring the BoNT gene cluster) which are often assigned to different species names, such as _C. sporogenes_ for _C. botulinum_ Group I strains 2. This polyphyly of _C. botulinum_ together with its close relationship to non-toxigenic species can result either in the erroneous detection of toxigenic _Clostridium_ species or failure thereof. The BoNT gene cluster is often associated with mobile genetic elements, allowing for interconversion between toxigenic and nontoxigenic _Clostridium_ species, and leading to substantial variation in BoNT sequences and their genomic backgrounds 3. Today, the BoNT serotypes are divided into more than 40 subtypes, including BoNT/A1 to BoNT/A8 4, and mosaic forms 5. The BoNT diversity at the amino acid level can reach up to 36 percent within a serotype and is reflected by differences in their catalytic activity, receptor binding or pharmacokinetics 6. In addition to containing the gene for BoNT, the BoNT gene cluster contains the gene for the non-toxic non-haemagglutinin (NTNH) protein. The BoNT gene cluster also harbors either 3 hemagglutinin (HA) genes (ha1, ha2 and ha3) in the HA cluster or 3 orfX genes (orfX1, orfX2 and orfX3) in the orfX cluster. Together with BoNT, these accessory proteins can form complexes of varying size and composition 7. The variability observed in BoNTs due to the existence of 7 serotypes, mosaic forms, several different subtypes and the occurrence of BoNT in different complexes, as well as their heterogeneous genetic background are probably the main reasons for the spectrum of clinical presentations and disease duration associated with botulism, and pose a tremendous challenge to diagnostic laboratories 8. Botulism is associated with a wide variety of foods that are rich in protein and kept under the partial exclusion of oxygen, or in an environment where oxygen has been depleted by other bacteria. Marinated meat, fish, fruits, vegetables or mushrooms as well as home-canned products and home-cured or smoked meat or fish products, which are consumed unheated, are particularly known sources. BoNTs are heat-labile and can be destroyed by temperatures above 70 C 158 F in minutes 9,10. Nowadays, foodborne botulism is almost exclusively associated with home-produced foods, but commercial food products are occasionally involved in single cases or small outbreaks 11-13. Between 2010-2014, ECDC reported 492 cases in Europe 14, with the last case occurring in Slovakia in 2012 15.<br><br><strong> The event -</strong><br> In mid-August 2015 (day 0), an otherwise healthy adult in their 40s consumed, for dinner, 3 packs (100 g each) 3.52 ounces of a commercial hummus spread. The hummus, which was sold in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, had a best-before date of 9 days after consumption. The following morning (day 1), 9-11 hours after consumption of the hummus, the patient experienced nausea, vomiting, double vision, unsteady gait, dizziness, generalized weakness and difficulties swallowing, and was admitted to hospital. Despite receiving 3 doses of equine trivalent anti-A, B and E antitoxin, the patient felt into a coma on day 2 and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). As botulism is a mandatory notifiable disease in Slovakia, the clinic reported the suspected botulism case to local health authorities. A gastric lavage, but neither serum nor stool, was taken on day 2 and stored at 4 C 39.2 F for further analysis. After one week of storage, the gastric lavage was sent to the Public Health Institute in Ostrava, Czech Republic where it tested negative by mouse bioassay. Treatment consisted mainly of intensive symptomatic care and respiratory support for almost 50 days. The patient was discharged from hospital after 78 days, but still complained about breathing problems as of their last follow-up in May 2017.<br><br><strong> Methods: Epidemiological investigation -</strong><br> On day one, after being notified by the clinic, the regional health authorities started an epidemiological investigation by interviewing the hospitalized patient. The next day, day 2, the patient's household was inspected to check for additional cases and to collect food samples. There, a close relative who shares the same household was interviewed, a list of food items consumed by the patient over the last days was recorded and suspicious food items were collected. In cooperation with the Slovak State Veterinary and Food Administration (SVPS), an investigation on the composition and the origin of the ingredients used for production of the hummus was conducted at the food processing facility.<br><br><strong> Laboratory investigation </strong><br> Isolation of _Clostridium botulinum_ from hummus and molecular analysis. Small particles of hummus left on the packaging of the 3 nearly empty hummus tubes were streaked on tryptic soy agar and Schaedler agar plates, and subjected to anaerobic culture at 37 C 98.6 F in anaerobic jars following EN ISO 7937:2005. Almost all colonies showed typical clostridia-like morphology and were probed for the presence of bont genes with a multiplex PCR for bont/A, bont/B, bont/E and bont/F 16 according to CEN ISO/TS 17919:2013. Genetic analysis Isolates were transferred to the Consultant laboratory for neurotoxin-producing clostridia (botulism, tetanus), formerly called the Consultant Laboratory for _Clostridium botulinum_, at the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) in Berlin, Germany for further molecular biological investigation. Isolates were grown in tryptone-peptone-glucose-yeast extract (TPGY) medium at 32 C 89.6 F in an anaerobic workstation (MG500, Don Whitley, Shipley, United Kingdom), and tested for the presence of bont/A-G by single and multiplex quantitative PCR 17. In addition, a quantitative PCR was used to test for the ntnh gene as a surrogate marker for BoNT-producing _Clostridium spp._ 18. To further investigate the composition of the BoNT gene cluster, a set of 6 conventional PCRs targeting the 3 ha genes and the 3 orfX genes was applied 19. Toxin production in supernatants was confirmed by in-house ELISA tests as described 20,21. The 16S rRNA and bont/A gene sequences were obtained by Sanger sequencing 22. Sequences were assembled and compared with the GenBank database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information in the United States via Geneious software packages (Biomatters Limited, Auckland, New Zealand) using the BLAST algorithm 23. For subtyping, the amino acid sequence of the BoNT was compared with the 8 known BoNT/A subtypes 4. Sequences of the other BoNT/A subtypes were uploaded into Geneious and pairwise identities of the aligned sequences were calculated using the MAFFT algorithm 24. For comparison, the BoNT subtypes of the following BoNT strains causing food-borne botulism in the past (except for BoNT/A4 which originated from an infant botulism case) were selected (GenBank accession numbers in parenthesis): BoNT/A1 (HA cluster) strain ATCC3502 (AM412317); BoNT/A1 (orfX cluster) strain NCTC2916 (X52066); BoNT/A2 (orfX cluster) strain Mascarpone (DQ310546); BoNT/A3 (orfX cluster) strain Loch Maree (CP000963); BoNT/A4 (orfX cluster) strain 657 (EU341307); BoNT/A5 (HA cluster) strain 1430.11 (KC683799); BoNT/A6 (orfX cluster) strain CDC41370 (FJ981696); BoNT/A7 (unknown cluster) strain 2008-148 (JQ954969); BoNT/A8 (orfX cluster) strain Chemnitz (KM233166). Further microbiological investigation In order to identify additional possibly contaminated products of the same production date, the Regional Authority of Public Health (RAPH) in Banska Bystrica investigated the products' availability at several local supermarkets and the food bank. While no additional hummus was available from the food bank, 3 tubes of hummus with the same production date as the ones consumed were obtained from a supermarket. Unopened products were stored at 37 C 98.6 F for several days to reach suitable conditions for _C. botulinum_/_C. sporogenes_ germination and growth.<br><br><strong> Results -</strong><br> Epidemiological investigation: Results from the interview revealed that on day 0, the patient alone ate scrambled eggs for breakfast; the patient, a close relative and a friend shared the same meal of mushrooms in cream sauce with pasta for lunch; and the patient alone ate the hummus at dinner after obtaining it from a food bank. The interview of the patient and a close relative revealed that one tube of the hummus product showed gas production prior to being opened, but it tasted normal according to the patient. The epidemiologists notified the Regional Veterinary and Food Administration of the Slovak Republic and the 3 nearly empty tubes of hummus and 2 unopened packs of a commercial ready-to-eat sauerkraut and vegetarian sausage meal, from the same company as the hummus, were sent for laboratory investigation. Neither the scrambled eggs nor the pasta dish were available for sampling. An investigation at the producing company revealed that the hummus product consisted of the following ingredients: chick peas, tofu, rapeseed oil, onion, salt, maize starch and spices. It also revealed that the chick peas originated from Brazil or Argentina. Laboratory investigation: RAPH received the collected food items, including the 3 opened and nearly empty 100 g 3.52 ounces hummus tubes. Three strains with typical _C. botulinum_ morphology (designated Banska Bystrica, RAPH1223j and RAPH1224) were isolated, one from each tube. Two of them, Banska Bystrica and RAPH1223j, were PCR-positive for the bont/A gene. The vegetarian sausage and sauerkraut meal tested negative for the presence of _C. botulinum_ and the bont/A gene. On day 7, as soon as the 1st results were available, the hummus was withdrawn from the market and a Food and Feed Safety Alert was issued through the European Commission's Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF). The 3 unopened hummus tubes with the same production date that were obtained from a supermarket were subjected to 37 C 98.6 F storage. Microbiological analysis and PCR testing did not reveal the presence of _C. botulinum_ or _C. sporogenes_ despite some signs of gas formation during storage. Molecular biological characterisation of isolated strains: The sequences of the 16S rRNA gene analysed at RKI revealed that all 3 isolates (strains Banska Bystrica, RAPH1223j and RAPH1224) belonged to _C. botulinum_ Group I/_C. sporogenes_ (greater than 99 percent identity), which are almost indistinguishable at the 16S rRNA sequence level 2,25. The presence of bont/A and ntnh genes was confirmed by quantitative PCR, and expression of the toxin was shown by an in-house ELISA for isolates Banska Bystrica and RAPH1223j. From the 2 BoNT/A-positive isolates, the BoNT/A sequences were obtained and compared with GenBank entries at the nucleotide (nt) and the amino acid level. Both toxigenic isolates (Banska Bystrica and RAPH1223j) were found to harbor a bont/A gene of identical sequence; the bont/A sequence of one strain, Banska Bystrica, was submitted to GenBank under accession number KU376389. It showed the highest identity (greater than or equal to 99.6 percent) to bont/A sequences of the unusual subtype BoNT/A3. Table one shows the distances computed against all BoNT/A subtypes at the nt and the amino acid levels for Table, see original URL - Mod.LL. Compared with the prototype BoNT/A1, the BoNT of the new BoNT/A-positive isolates, Banska Bystrica and RAPH1223j, had an identity at the amino acid level of only 84.6 percent (compared with BoNT/A1 strain ATCC3502; HA cluster) or 84.5 percent (compared with BoNT/A1 strain NCTC2916; orfX cluster). Similar low amino acid level identities (between 84.3 percent and 87.7 percent) were found when compared with BoNT subtypes A4-A8, whereas amino acid level identity with subtype A2 (strain Mascarpone) was 92.9 percent. Sequence identities at the nt level were generally higher, but still diverged by up to 8.5 percent. Both isolates (Banska Bystrica and RAPH1223j) were negative for the ha1, ha2 and ha3 genes and positive for the orfX1, orfX2 and orfX3 genes by PCR; this is in agreement with the BoNT/A3 strain Loch Maree in which the bont/A gene is located in the orfX cluster.<br><br><strong> Discussion </strong><br> Our laboratory investigations support the diagnosis of a case of foodborne botulism caused by the unusual BoNT subtype A3 in food consumed by the patient. To our knowledge, this is only the 2nd time that this subtype was involved in foodborne botulism since 8 people died from contaminated wild duck paste in Loch Maree, Scotland in 1922 26. No other strain belonging to this specific A3 subtype was isolated or subtyped for nearly a century until Luquez and colleagues identified 3 strains from Argentina (in soil and salad) in 2012 27. Interestingly, the 2 described BoNT/A-positive isolates have an identical BoNT/A sequence at the amino acid level as one of the strains (CDC54054) isolated from Argentinian soil 27, and the chick peas used in the hummus consumed by the patient originated from South America, either from Brazil or Argentina. Initially, suspected botulism could not be confirmed by testing the gastric lavage taken on day 2. Considering the acidity and proteolytic activity, as well as the length of storage, the gastric lavage taken after emesis on day one was not an ideal sample. Serum and stool samples, which have been proposed to be the most reliable samples for diagnostic testing 28, might not have been collected, because of a lack of testing facilities and inexperienced clinical personnel, particularly since botulism is a rare disease and no cases have been notified in Slovakia since 2012 15. For the clinician, it is important to consider the optimal timing when choosing samples for botulism diagnosis. Despite demonstration of BoNT in serum as one of the key tests to confirm botulism, the time period in which BoNT can be detected from serum is usually limited to the 1st few days after oral ingestion. However, confirmation of BoNT-producing _Clostridium_ species (spores) from feces can often be achieved over a more prolonged period (up to two weeks) 28,29. Therefore, co-examination of serum and stool is recommended to confirm clinical cases of food-borne botulism 28-31. The mere detection of _C. botulinum_ from feces without clinical symptoms does not imply the presence of botulism given that _C. botulinum spores_ are not usually detected in the feces of healthy humans. However, on rare occasions, spores that have been ingested with naturally contaminated food (e.g. honey, fresh vegetables) might be detected in the feces of otherwise healthy people 28. In our case, foodborne botulism could only be confirmed by the isolation of _C. botulinum_ from 2 of the 3 consumed tubes of hummus. It is always hard to exclude that the analyzed food become cross-contaminated in the household with _C. botulinum_ by handling with kitchen utensils contaminated via another food. However, there was no indication that the hummus became cross-contaminated within the patient's household. In the aftermath of the current botulism case, 3 unopened hummus tubes with the same production date were subjected to 37 C 98.6 F storage and analyzed for the presence of _C. botulinum_ without any positive result. It is not unusual that _C. botulinum_ cannot be detected from other items of the same lot. In 3 botulism outbreaks in Europe in 2011, which involved commercial olive tapenade, almond-stuffed olives and korma sauce, _C. botulinum_ and BoNT could only be identified from one or 2 opened jars/pots obtained from the households, but not from any unopened jars/pots from the same lot (consisting of 60, 900, and 1836 items, respectively) that were tested 11,32-34. These cases indicate that even in modern industrialized food production, contamination of a single or a very few items within a lot cannot be completely excluded. In all those cases, consumer protection had utmost priority and food recalls were issued solely on the basis of positive results from the remaining product in the open containers from the affected households to prevent a potential spread of the disease 32-34. Hummus has been involved in a foodborne botulism outbreak in the past, possibly due to incorrect storage temperature 35 C 95 F. Whether this was the case in the event presented here could not be determined, but the patient did notice gas formation in the products. This might be indicative of spoilage as growth of _C. botulinum_ in spoiled products is often associated with gas production, e.g. foaming, bulging of cans 36. However, unlike Group II strains of _C. botulinum_ which can grow at refrigeration temperatures, Group I strains (to which this study's isolated strains belong) require growth temperatures above 10 C 50 F 2. This suggests that the hummus product was at least partially stored above refrigeration temperatures. Compared with the known 8 BoNT/A subtypes (BoNT/A1 to BoNT/A8 4), the subtype A3 is both very rare and the most distant from the prototype BoNT/A1 (Table 1), being up to 15.4 percent and 8 percent different at the amino acid and nt level, respectively. Notably, because of its amino acid sequence divergence, BoNT/A3 is known to be neutralized less efficiently by polyclonal antibodies generated against BoNT/A1 37. This has led us to speculate that the long lasting neurological effects observed in the patient despite the administration of 3 doses of trivalent antitoxin might at least be partially due to suboptimal neutralization by the antitoxin, which is directed against BoNT/A1. The rareness and divergence of the BoNT/A3 subtype poses the risk that it might not be detected by immunological or sequence-based diagnostic assays that have not been validated against it. In fact, one ELISA has already been shown to be unable to detect it 38. Furthermore, in one 39 of the 4 mentioned PCR methods in ISO ISO/TS 17919:2013, the sequence of one primer and the probe each contain one mismatch towards all BoNT/A3 sequences. These mismatches might therefore hamper identification of strains belonging to the A3 subtype by the corresponding PCR 40,41. Testing laboratories should be aware that strains harboring this rare subtype can occur in European countries and are advised to validate their methods accordingly. Unfortunately, the exchange of BoNT-producing strains and in some instances, even the sharing of their sequence information are restricted because of their nature as possible biowarfare agents and other dual-use concerns 42,43.<br><br><strong> Conclusion </strong><br> Rare and novel BoNT sequence variation can especially easily escape detection by sequence-based or immunological methods. As more sequences become available despite some restrictions, diagnostic facilities should check their PCRs frequently to ensure inclusion of all known sequence variations. As a result of the rareness of botulism, many laboratories have no or only individual assays for detection at hand. Specialized laboratories (e.g. national reference laboratories or consultant laboratories) able to apply a broader range of methods could aid those laboratories, but are often not easily identifiable by the laboratories responsible for testing the samples.

Zika virus (or Zika) has been reported in Aruba. Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in Aruba are infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:  Women who are pregnant:  Do not travel to Aruba.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to Aruba or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers considering pregnancy:  Before you or your partner travel, talk to your health care provider about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection.  Wait before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.  If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex &ndash; or do not have sex &ndash; for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex, or do not have sex, for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy  Talk to your health care provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you&rsquo;re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Wait at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  Men are advised to wait longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.gov  Contact CDC  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  1600 Clifton Road  Atlanta ,  GA  30329-4027  USA  800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)  Contact CDC-INFO  TOP","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Australia":{"56":{"title":"Hendra virus - Australia: (eastern) incr. risk,\r\n\tintrusion on fruit bat habitats ","date":["15","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH/EDR> Hendra virus - Australia: (eastern) incr. risk,\r\n\tintrusion on fruit bat habitats [EXTERNAL]","summary":"   Tue 15 Aug 2017 Source: Phys.org edited There is a rising risk of human and domestic animal exposure to deadly Hendra virus (HeV) carried by fruit bats in Eastern Australia due to human intrusion into their habitats, human proximity to woodlands and vegetation loss, a new study reveals. Reported today Tue 15 Aug 2017 in Scientific Reports by researchers from the University of Sydney, University of Melbourne and State University of New York, the study traces how pressures such as expanding human populations, urbanization and forest fragmentation altered the shape and size of the habitats of pteropid fruit bats (flying foxes) in the decades between 1980 and 2015. In recent years, bats from the Pteropodidae family have been pinpointed as 'natural reservoirs' of several emerging zoonotic viruses, such as Hendra virus (HeV), Nipah (NiV) and Ebola, which can cause death in humans. Pteropid fruit bats carry HeV without becoming ill. Research has shown the black flying fox (Pteropus alecto) and the spectacled flying fox (_Pteropus conspicillatus_) harbor the infectious HeV and can shed HeV particles in their urine. Their suitability as reservoirs has been linked to their capacity for flight, adaptability to different food sources, population structure, longevity and immune function. \"Pteropid fruit bats are essential pollinators and seed distributors in tropical and subtropical forests,\" says Dr Michael Walsh of the University of Sydney's Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity, who led the study. \"Human-caused changes in their habitat exemplify the precarious balance between ecosystem integrity and human public health. \"The opportunity for the transmission of animal-borne viruses to human populations arises when these changes in natural habitats create new configurations of ecosystems and animal populations that subsequently generate increased or unprecedented contact between human, domestic animal and wildlife communities.\" Hendra virus was 1st identified during the 1st recorded outbreak of the disease in the Brisbane suburb of Hendra, Australia, in 1994. The outbreak involved 21 stabled racehorses and 2 human cases. This newly emerging infectious disease made several further sporadic occurrences between 1994 and 2010 until in 2011 an unprecedented number of 18 distinct 'spillovers' more than doubled the number of known incidents. A spillover event is defined as transmission of a pathogen such as HeV from a reservoir such as a pteropid fruit bat to a domestic animal such as a horse. It also includes pathogen transmission from an infected domestic animal such as a horse to a human. As of August 2017, there have been 60 known outbreaks of Hendra resulting in the death of 102 horses, all occurring in the north-eastern coastal region of Australia. To date, 7 humans have contracted HeV in spillover events arising from the care or autopsy of ill or dead horses. Of those who tested positive for HeV, 4 died of the disease, including 2 veterinarians. \"The epidemiology of HeV spillover events indicates that expanding suburban communities may draw foraging flying foxes from nearby forest ranges into encroaching residential and community gardens and thereby, closer to horses,\" Dr Walsh says. The researchers did 2 sets of analyses to assess whether an expansion of the HeV reservoir was associated with an increasing trend in spillover risk. First, they modeled changes in 1713 geo-located sightings of pteropid fruit bats P. alecto and P. conspicillatus at 3 different time points between 1980 and 2015 in response to factors such as climate, topography, and human migration in the preceding decade. They found that rainfall, altitude, temperature, and human migration were highly associated with decadal changes in the ecological niche (as measured by sightings) of the black flying fox and the spectacled flying fox. \"The predicted habitat suitability for HeV reservoir pteropids expands geographically southward along the eastern coast of Australia from the earliest period in 1980-1989 to the latest in 2000-2015,\" Dr Walsh says. \"These changes predict that southeastern Queensland and northeastern NSW show consistently high habitat suitability, while advancing toward and beyond Sydney. There is also a corridor along the northern coast of the Northern Territory that shows a high degree of predicted habitat suitability.\" In their 2nd analysis, the researchers assessed whether HeV infections in horses and humans (spillover incidents) between 2000 and 2015 were associated with decadal changes in the ecological niche (as measured by sightings) of _P. alecto_ and _P. conspicillatus_ from 1980 to 2015. They found a high association between the 2, meaning the inter-decadal expanding reservoir niche of pteropid fruit bats was highly associated with a concurrent increasing trend for risk of HeV infections in humans. Furthermore, the risk of HeV infection increased threefold as the ecological niche expanded along the coast in Queensland and NSW during the 1st 2 decades under study (1980-1999) and increased further still as habitat suitability continued to change from 2000-2015. \"The shared history between HeV spillover and the ecological niche of flying foxes notwithstanding, reservoir habitat suitability alone was insufficient to describe the spatial dependence of HeV spillover,\" says Dr Walsh. \"The human footprint, proximity to woody savanna, and vegetation loss were additional components of the landscape required to adequately describe the spatial dependence of spillover across eastern Australia.\" The findings supported the researchers' hypothesis that the risk for HeV infection in Eastern Australia between 2000 and 2015 was associated with changes in the ecological niche of pteropid fruit bats in the decades between 1980 and 2015. Furthermore, this risk was highly associated with human intrusion into their habitats, human proximity to woodlands and vegetation loss.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail This would mean horse owners need to be especially wary of the equine habitat where their horses are kept. Build shelters over the water troughs and fence off the fruit trees that attract the bats. Furthermore, the likelihood of veterinarians being exposed from treating horses could mean that vaccination for the horse could become mandatory. - Mod.TG See: \"The Hendra vaccine: your questions answered\", Equine Veterinarians Australia, Australia Veterinary Association at  . - Mod.ML   .

This was confirmed upon receipt of laboratory results from test samples that were sent to Australia. Agriculture officials were quick to assure, however, that the strain is slow to spread and causes few deaths. \"The rate of transmission is very, very low,\" Arlene Vytiaco, who heads animal disease control in the Bureau of Animal Industry, said in a press briefing on Thursday. She explained that countries like Japan and Myamnar have been affected by H5N6 but have reported no humans infected by the avian influenza. \"The mortality rate is also low,\" Vytiaco said. Since H5N6 started in 2014, only 20 deaths have been reported worldwide. The Department of Health has been conducting regular check-ups on farmers and workers in areas hit by the bird flu outbreak. Vytiaco said no new patients have been admitted since 2 farm workers reported flu-like symptoms last week week of Sun 13 Aug 2017 but eventually tested negative for bird flu. The government had been waiting to see what the bird flu's specific N strain was - particularly on the lookout for the N1 and N6 strains, which can be passed on to humans. Local tests had confirmed it was not the far deadlier H5N1 virus. However, it had to send samples to Australia to check whether it was H5N6, since the government did not have its own test kits here. This was said by Dr Arlene Vytiaco, who oversees disease control for the Bureau of Animal Industry. Reports of bird flu being present were 1st reported earlier this month August 2017. The virus was found in birds from 7 farms in San Luis, Pampanga. The Department of Agriculture DA earlier said the virus had been present since April 2017, but was only reported in August 2017 after 37 000 birds had died. It added the strain of avian flu present in these birds was not transmissible to humans. On Sun 13 Aug 2017, agriculture secretary Manny Piñol said another round of tests was under way to determine whether H5N6  the strain of the virus that can be passed on to humans  was present. The DA imposed a ban on the shipment of poultry and poultry products from Luzon to other parts of the country on Sun 13 Aug 2017 as a precautionary measure, but it was lifted on Tue 22 Aug 2017. byline: Claire Jiao  communicated by: ProMED-mail The above report provides follow-up information on an earlier post Avian influenza, human (66): Philippines, H5 http://promedmail.org/post/20170818.5254521, in which 2 human cases were suspected to have avian influenza H5, but were confirmed as negative.

The steep increase, the highest number of cases in one week since 2015, has taken the total number of confirmed cases since January 2017 to 14 455. Mr Dick said Queenslanders could still take steps to prevent themselves from getting the flu, including getting the vaccination and staying home from work if they are sick. Health Minister Cameron Dick said it was not too late for people to get the flu vaccination. \"You don't have to go to work if you're sick; you can stay at home and recover from the flu,\" he said. Queensland Health public health executive director Sonya Bennett, from the communicable diseases unit, said the increase in confirmed flu cases showed that there is a \"fair bit\" of influenza circulating in the community. \"It may still rise again the next week or so, as the minister said it's not too late to vaccinate.\" Mr Dick said people with flu symptoms should think about visiting their GP instead of the emergency department. \"If you have a lower level condition, you may have to wait for treatment, because we must give priority to people who require assistance,\" he said. Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital emergency specialist David Rosengren said emergency services were \"well equipped\" to deal with the surge in demand; staff members have also been affected by the winter illness. \"It is certainly very challenging at the moment, when we have a record demand for services,\" Dr Rosengren said. \"Reserve a visit to the emergency department for occasions when it's truly needed.\" The vast majority of this year's 2017 flu cases were influenza A, which Dr Rosengren said was likely behind the heightened demand on emergency services. \"75 per cent of our cases this year 2017 happen to be influenza A, which tends to cause a more significant symptom complex for patients than influenza B,\" he said. Dr Rosengren said it was important for people to minimise their contact with other people if they believed they had the flu. \"If you are unwell ... with symptoms typical of the flu, please be very conscious of the impact of spreading that around the community, and if you're unwell, stay at home,\" he said. Dr Bennett said most people would be able to tell whether they had influenza instead of an ordinary winter cold. \"I think we've all been unwell from time to time and understand when rest ... is the best method,\" she said. \"Or if you're feeling particularly unwell, can't get out of bed, not able to eat and drink effectively, those sorts of signs are the indication that you should go and see your doctor.\" With hundreds of thousands of people expected to attend the Ekka show from Friday 11 Aug 2017, Dr Bennett said the best way to avoid picking up the flu along with a show bag was to be vaccinated. \"Like any mass gathering when it is influenza season and gastro season, the best way to protect yourself is to practice good hygiene, so regular handwashing and vaccination are the best protections against the flu,\" she said. \"I would ask people that are attending any mass gathering to consider those things.\" Byline: Rachel Clun  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\.

Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world. A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries. Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years. \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\" \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea\". The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years 2 million DALYs since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln 13 million DALYs in the US, and 36-mln 36 million DALYs in Ethiopia. \"Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,\" continues Prof Melegaro \"our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population. Tailoring immunization campaigns to achieve measles eradication goals is essential and currently, for some countries, this means considering also the role of unprotected adolescents and young adults.

Septoria tritici blotch has built up to levels that could cause significant damage this year 2017. Agriculture Victoria cereal pathologist Grant Hollaway said septoria is now the major fungal disease issue in south-west Victoria. \"It has really emerged as a problem over the past five or six years.\" He said the major threat would be in the medium rainfall zone where the disease had not been spotted for many years. \"Septoria was common in the Wimmera in low levels last year 2016 and this has provided the carryover inoculum.\" There are parallels in septoria's reappearance after a lengthy absence with that of stripe rust, which Dr Hollaway said returned to Victoria in 2003 following a 20 year hiatus. \"It is more of a stripe rust in terms of the damage it can cause,\" he said. Byline: Gregor Heard  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Septoria leaf blotch of cereals is caused by fungi in the septoria species complex, which includes _Zymoseptoria tritici_ (previously _Septoria tritici_), _Mycosphaerella graminicola_ and _Phaeosphaeria nodorum_ (previously _Stagonospora nodorum_). They affect mainly wheat, but also barley and oats and occasionally rye and some grass species. Symptoms on wheat and barley are very similar and may occur at any time during the growth cycle and on any portion of the plant. They include blotches on both leaves and glumes, which reduce the photosynthetic ability of the host. Disease development is favoured by humid conditions. Up to 50 per cent yield losses have been reported on susceptible varieties. Spores can be spread by infected plant material, wind, water (rain splash) and mechanical means. The pathogens can overwinter on crop debris and on autumn sown crops or volunteers. Disease management includes fungicide treatments aimed at preventing the disease becoming established on the upper 3 leaves of the crop canopy (where it would affect the ears most), removal of inoculum sources and use of resistant varieties. After the cereal rusts, the disease is considered the most important challenge to plant breeders (see ProMED-mail post http://promedmail.org/post/20120831.1274190) and a threat to food security worldwide. Pathogen strains with high levels of resistance to many fungicides are emerging, for example, in the UK and other parts of Europe (ProMED-mail post http://promedmail.org/post/20160516.4225677), as well as Australia and New Zealand (ProMED-mail posts http://promedmail.org/post/20161031.4598540, http://promedmail.org/post/20140417.2410219). In Australia, STB was reported as the 1st wheat disease developing fungicide resistance on that continent (ProMED-mail post http://promedmail.org/post/20140313.2329774). The possibility cannot be excluded that the re-emergence of STB in eastern Australia may be due to new fungal strains which have adapted to local conditions.

LL) is a major cause of serious human gastrointestinal illness and have the potential to cause life-threatening complications, such as hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) (1). An average of 0.4 cases of EHEC illness per 100 000 persons per year are reported to public health authorities in Australia (2). Disease severity can range from asymptomatic infection to serious and sometimes fatal illness, particularly in young children and the elderly (3,4). Healthy ruminants, particularly cattle, are the reservoir for EHEC (5). Human infection with EHEC usually occurs as a result of inadvertent ingestion of fecal matter after consumption of contaminated food, water, or unpasteurized milk; contact with animals or their environments; or secondarily, through contact with infected humans (4,5). In the largest previously reported outbreak of EHEC illness in Australia in 1995, which was associated with consumption of mettwurst (uncooked, semidry, fermented sausages), HUS developed in 23 of the 51 case-patients identified, and there was 1 death (6).<br><br><strong> The Study -</strong><br> A multidisciplinary incident management team was established to investigate an outbreak of EHEC illness associated with an annual agricultural show in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, in August 2013. The incident management team defined primary and secondary outbreak cases. Persons with laboratory-confirmed EHEC infection associated with the outbreak and their household contacts were followed up until the point of microbiological evidence of clearance, which was defined as 2 consecutive negative stool samples collected more than 24h apart (7). Case-patients and contacts with a high risk for transmission (persons under 5 years of age; persons unable to maintain good hygiene; or childcare, healthcare, aged care, or food preparation workers) were advised to avoid childcare and work settings in accordance with Queensland Health Guidelines (7). Enhanced surveillance measures were implemented to assist with case finding. Medical practitioners were requested to avoid use of antimicrobial drugs for suspected case-patients with EHEC infections because of previously reported associations between antimicrobial drug use and HUS. We developed a case-control study to obtain additional information related to animal contact, hand hygiene, and food consumption at the agricultural show. We analyzed data by using Epi Info 7 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA). EHEC identified from human, environmental, and animal samples were serotyped for O and H antigens. Expression of Shiga toxin 1 (stx1) and stx2 genes was determined for selected isolates. Shiga toxin gene subtyping and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis was performed. During 21 Aug 2013 to 27 Sep 2013, we identified 57 outbreak-associated laboratory-confirmed case-patients with EHEC infection: 54 confirmed primary case-patients, 1 probable primary case-patient, and 2 secondary case-patients (Figure 1 for figures, see original URL - Mod. LL). Of the 57 cases-patients, 32 (56 percent) were female. Case-patients ranged in age from 1 to 77 (median 9) years; 31 (56 percent) case-patients were 3.

Sporadic transmission of HEV genotypes 3 and 4 in high-income countries has been associated with exposure to blood and animal contact. The objective of the study was to identify the risk factors for hepatitis E and the genotype(s) causing sporadic hepatitis E in Dhaka, Bangladesh. We selected, from a diagnostic center in Dhaka between November 2008 and November 2009, cases presenting with jaundice and anti-HEV IgM antibodies and age-matched controls were defined as those with no history of jaundice and normal blood test results. Serum samples were tested for HEV RNA using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction followed by a sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. A total of 109 cases and 109 controls were enrolled. The cases were more likely to be male (adjusted matched odds ratios mOR 2.2, 95 percent CI: 1.2-3.9; P = 0.01), or have reported contact with another person's blood or blood product, or contact with blood-contaminated sharp instruments (adjusted mOR 2.1, 95 percent CI: 1.1-4.1; P = 0.03) than controls. There were no significant differences between the cases and the controls in terms of reported high-risk sexual intercourse, consumption of undercooked meat, or contact or drinking fecally-contaminated water. The sera from 3 cases carried HEV RNA, all belonging to genotype 1. Findings from this study suggest that contact with human blood and sharing sharp instruments may transmit sporadic hepatitis E in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Efforts to prevent the transmission of blood-borne pathogens may also prevent sporadic HEV transmission in this endemic setting.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-SoAs There has been increased interest, especially in Europe, of assessing the risk of HEV transmission via blood transfusion in order to assess the need for routine screening. Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis E is generally self-limited without a chronic phase but it is clear, especially with genotype 3 that chronic infection may occur. This is particularly true in individuals with cellular immunodeficiencies such as those who are solid organ transplant recipients and those infected with HIV. - Mod.LL   .

Given the outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections in the region, and the clinical similarity of cases of that virus infection and CHIKV infection, one wonders how many cases that were not laboratory confirmed but clinically diagnosed as ZIKV infections were, in reality, CHIKV infections. It is also possible that a significant proportion of the population have been infected by CHIKV in the previous 3 years and are now immune.

Outbreak of sudden death with acute encephalitis syndrome among children associated with exposure to lychee orchards in Northern Bangladesh, 2012. Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2017; doi:10.4269/ajtmh.<br><br><strong>16-0856; available on line 24 Jul 2017 -</strong><br> Abstract Recurrent outbreaks of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) among children in lychee growing areas in Asia highlight the need to better understand the etiology and the context. We conducted a mixed-methods study to identify risk factors for disease, and behaviors and practices around lychee cultivation in an AES outbreak community in northern Bangladesh in 2012. The outbreak affected 14 children; 13 died. The major symptoms included unconsciousness, convulsion, excessive sweating, and frothy discharge. The median time from illness onset to unconsciousness was 2.5 hours. The outbreak corresponded with lychee harvesting season. Multiple pesticides including some banned in Bangladesh were frequently used in the orchards. Visiting a lychee orchard within 24 hours before onset (age-adjusted odds ratio aOR = 11.6 1.02-109.8) and 3 days (aOR = 7.2 1.4-37.6), and family members working in a lychee orchard (aOR = 7.2 1.7-29.4) and visiting any garden while pesticides were being applied (aOR = 4.9 1.0-19.4) in 3 days preceding illness onset were associated with illness in nearby village analysis. In neighborhood analysis, visiting an orchard that used pesticides (aOR = 8.4 1.4-49.9) within 3 days preceding illness onset was associated with illness. Eating lychees was not associated with illness in the case-control study. The outbreak was linked to lychee orchard exposures where agrochemicals were routinely used, but not to consumption of lychees. Lack of acute specimens was a major limitation. Future studies should target collection of environmental and food samples, acute specimens, and rigorous assessment of community use of pesticides to determine etiology. Discussion The clinical manifestations in case-patients including sudden onset without a prodromal phase, becoming unconscious within a median of 2.5 hours of illness onset, and the short duration between onset of illness to death all suggest that the outbreak was more likely due to a toxic poisoning than an infection. The outbreak was restricted to the lychee season and to a geographic area in which lychees are grown, which suggests that this outbreak of AES may be linked to exposure to lychees or lychee orchards. In India, the leading hypothesis of AES etiology among children living near lychee orchards was the ingestion of phytotoxins, specifically methylenecyclopropylglycine that is present in lychee seeds and pulp, which can lead to hypoglycemia among malnourished children. Without acute biological specimens, and therefore, lack of measured blood glucose levels from children in this outbreak in Bangladesh, we were unable to investigate this hypothesis directly. However, our epidemiologic and clinical findings suggest that methylenecyclopropyl-glycine alone may not explain this AES outbreak among children. There are multiple lines of evidence that agrochemical poisoning may also have contributed. In our study, the signs and symptoms are also consistent with acute pesticide poisoning in children reported in different countries of the world. The outbreak ended following the onset of the monsoon rains, which suggest that the toxin associated with the lychees was on their surface, rather than contained in the fruit. In India, a similar pattern was observed, where the number of cases peaked in mid-June and declined immediately after the onset of monsoon rains. Moreover, the findings of washing fruits and vegetables protective against lychee-associated illness in India further supports our assertion that toxin associated with the lychees may be on the surface. Finally, in India, mortality decline among AES case-patients after rapid correction of hypoglycemia with intravenous dextrose. Although we were unable to measure blood glucose level among the case-patients, however, distribution of blood glucose meter among clinician may help identifying patients with hypoglycemia and rapid correction of hypoglycemia with intravenous glucose may reduce mortality in children in Bangladesh.  communicated by: ProMED-mail The authors indicate that studies based on hospital records and retrospective interviews have significant limitations in confirming the etiology of AES and establishing agrochemical intoxication as the causative factor. One hopes that this study will stimulate prospective studies of AES that will include laboratory supported toxicology confirming exposure to specific, identified agrochemicals, and the clinical details following exposure, including incidence of hypoglycemia, a frequently mentioned condition in AES cases in India.

However the original published report (above) provides additional detail. In the previous report, Mod.TG provided relevant toxicological information that follows. - Mod.TY \"Endosulfan, a commercial product of 2 isomers, is a chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticide. As such, it may be used as wood preservative, but is also a contact poison for many insects and mites. Therefore it has been used on food crops, such as vegetables, grains, fruits and teas to rid these crops of damaging pests. \"Endosulfan is a highly toxic substance whose toxicity is partly dependent upon how the pesticide is applied. The body absorption is rapid in the presence of alcohols, oils or other emulsifiers (on the skin or in the preparation), but otherwise is slowly and incompletely absorbed by the body. \"Generally endosulfan appears to affect the central nervous system. Acute symptoms include incoordination, agitation, convulsion and even loss of consciousness. Other symptoms include vomiting, and diarrhea. In cattle grazing fields sprayed with endosulfan blindness has been documented. Furthermore, these animals may recover when removed from the exposure and given time, perhaps of a month or more. Likewise sheep and pigs grazing on treated fields have been reported with incoordination and blindness. \"Chronic toxicities may affect kidneys, liver, blood chemistry, and the parathyroid gland. There may be other chronic effects such as reproductive effects, teratogenic, mutagenic and/or carcinogenic effects. \"While endosulfans can and do affect a number of body systems chronically, the case of the children in the fruit orchards is an acute case. \"It seems that despite the age of the original case, we at least have an answer regarding the poisoning of the children. - Mod.TG\" ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Barbados":{"173":{"title":["Zika Virus in Barbados"],"date":["08","August","2017"],"url":"wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/alert/zika-virus-barbados","summary":" Magill Partners GeoSentinel Global TravEpiNet Mobile Apps RSS Feeds  Zika Virus in Barbados  Recommend on Facebook  Tweet  Share Compartir  Warning - Level 3, Avoid Nonessential Travel  Alert - Level 2, Practice Enhanced Precautions  Watch - Level 1, Practice Usual Precautions  Language:  Select  Espa&ntilde;ol  What is the current situation?

If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you&rsquo;re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Wait at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  Men are advised to wait longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.gov  Contact CDC  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  1600 Clifton Road  Atlanta ,  GA  30329-4027  USA  800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)  Contact CDC-INFO  TOP","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Belarus":{},"Belgium":{"62":{"title":"Zika virus (16): Americas, Asia, research,\r\n\tobservations ","date":["17","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Zika virus (16): Americas, Asia, research,\r\n\tobservations [EXTERNAL]","summary":" 11 _Culex quinquefasciatus_ as vectors  Wed 9 Aug 2017 Source: Emerging Microbes & Infections edited ref: Guedes DR, Paiva MH, Donato MM, et al.

Ministers and food safety chiefs from around the European Union are set to meet on Tue 6 Sep 2017 in a bid to get countries to stop \"blaming and shaming\" each other over the scare involving the chemical fipronil. Millions of eggs have been pulled from supermarket shelves across Europe and dozens of poultry farms closed since the discovery of fipronil, which can harm human health, was made public on 1 Aug 2017. The issue has sparked a row between Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, the 3 countries at the epicentre of the crisis, about how long they knew about the problem. \"Blaming and shaming will bring us nowhere and I want to stop this,\" Vytenis Andriukaitis, the European Commissioner for health and food safety, told AFP as he announced the meeting. \"We need to work together to draw the necessary lessons and move forward instead.\" European Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said that \"this is not, let's be clear, a crisis meeting\" and it is being held next month September 2017 to get \"distance to the events\". Fipronil is commonly used to get rid of fleas, lice and ticks from animals but is banned by the European Union from use in the food industry. The EU insists there is no threat to human health, but the World Health Organization (WHO) says that when eaten in large quantities it can harm people's kidneys, liver and thyroid glands. Brussels said the 15 affected EU countries were Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Sweden, Britain, Austria, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Denmark, along with non-EU Switzerland. But in a sign the crisis is going global, Brussels also announced that Hong Kong had received some tainted eggs from the Netherlands, with the southern Chinese city becoming the 1st place in Asia known to be affected. As well as dealing with the immediate food safety issue, the EU is also seeking to calm tempers over the egg row after a series of divisive crises in the bloc in recent years, from Brexit to migration. Belgium earlier this week week of Mon 6 Aug 2017 accused the Netherlands of knowing about the fipronil eggs since November 2016 and failing to notify other countries. On Thu 10 Aug 2017 Dutch Health Minister Edith Schippers admitted the government had made \"errors\" but denied a cover-up. \"We were well aware of a report of the presence of fipronil in the pens of egg-laying hens in November 2016, but there was no indication at the time that fipronil itself was found in the eggs,\" said Schippers. A Dutch whistleblower separately said he had told the authorities that Chickfriend, the Dutch company at the centre of the scandal, was illegally using fipronil in the treatment of lice in chicken pens in The Netherlands. \"I am the anonymous whistleblower,\" Nick Hermens told the NPO public broadcaster. A Belgian company, Poultry Vision, has said it provided Chickfriend with the chemical. Dutch and Belgian investigators carried out coordinated raids on several premises on Thu 10 Aug 2017, arresting 2 people at Chickfriend. However, Belgium itself has been forced to admit that it knew about fipronil in eggs back in June 2017 but kept it secret for nearly 2 months because of a criminal investigation. Fresh discoveries of contaminated eggs have continued daily. Denmark said on Fri 11 Aug 2017 it had found 2 tonnes of fipronil-tainted scrambled eggs, bringing the total of contaminated eggs to 22 tonnes, mainly from Belgium. Poland said it had discovered about 40 000 eggs imported from Germany. French Agriculture Minister Stephane Travert said that since April 2017 the country had sold nearly 250 000 contaminated eggs, imported from Belgium and the Netherlands, but the risk for consumers was \"very low\" given French eating habits. The food scare is one of the biggest to hit Europe since the 2013 horsemeat scandal when equine meat was falsely labelled and mis-sold. Previous food scandals include contamination of chickens and eggs by dioxin in 1999, which began in Belgium, and mad-cow disease via cattle feed contaminated by the ground-up carcasses of animals infected with a deadly brain disorder - which ran from roughly 1986 to 1998 and started in Britain.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\.

Zika virus (or Zika) has been reported in Belize. Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in Belize are infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:  Women who are pregnant:  Do not travel to Belize.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to Belize or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers considering pregnancy:  Before you or your partner travel, talk to your health care provider about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection.  Wait before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.  If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex &ndash; or do not have sex &ndash; for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More Zika information for pregnant women  2.

Ciguatera poisoning, which causes symptoms such as tingling and numbness in fingers and toes, around lips, tongue, mouth and throat; nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and/or abdominal cramps; joint pains and headache; and breathing difficulty, has also been reported in Belize, and over the past 4 days, 2 alerts have been issued by the Ministry of Health in Belize, following reports of cases cropping up, which have been linked to the consumption of barracuda fish. In the 1st alert, issued on Fri 18 Aug 2017, the Ministry of Health reported that \"suspected fish poisoning (Ciguatera poisoning) was detected in people that had eaten fish bought from a fish vendor in Ladyville, Belize District.\" In the 2nd alert, issued on Tue 23 Aug 2017, the Ministry said that 2 further cases of suspected Ciguatera poisoning, linked to the consumption of the large predatory fish, had been identified. \"Investigations conducted so far reveal that the barracuda fish from the Turneffe Islands area has been the sole carrier of the ciguaxtoin or poison,\" the alert said. It warned that toxic fish does not have any odor or taste and cooking and freezing does not eliminate the toxin. According to the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ciguatera fish poisoning (or ciguatera) is an illness caused by eating fish that contain toxins produced by a marine microalgae called _Gambierdiscus toxicus_, associated with corals. Whereas the barracuda is believed to be the culprit for the most recent bouts of illness caused by the toxin, other fish may also carry the toxin, including coral trout, red snapper, donu, parrot fish, grouper, Spanish mackerel, red emperor, wrasse, reef cod, sturgeon fish, trevally and moray eel. The CDC also lists blackfin snapper, cubera snapper, dog snapper, greater amberjack, hogfish, horse-eye jack, and king mackerel among the fish which have been known to carry ciguatoxins. \"Anyone who consumes fish contaminated with the ciguatera toxin will become ill,\" the Ministry's alert said, adding that, \"The gastrointestinal or stomach symptoms normally appear within 24 hours of exposure and those of the nervous system can appear 1 to 2 days later.\" Although some symptoms may last only a few days, in some cases, the toxin can continue to affect those who ingest it for months. The CDC says people who have ciguatera may find that cold things feel hot and hot things feel cold. The Belize Ministry of Health has shared some guidelines for reducing the risk of CFP. It advises the following: - Avoid eating larger reef fish that have a greater likelihood of carrying ciguatoxins, especially the barracuda. - Limit the weight of a fish to less than 11 pounds, as ciguatera fish poisoning occurs more frequently in larger fish. - Eat other types of fish not listed above. - Avoid eating the head, roe or fish egg, liver, or other organs of the fish, as it is where the highest level of toxin is present.

Children like him are already weakened by hunger and illness, but are now facing the threat of contracting cholera. The deadly disease is one of the fastest spreading in Somaliland and is claiming the lives of many, from the old to the very young. In some areas, 500 cases are reported each day. And quarantine tents have been put up to deal with the most severely ill until they can be housed on hospital wards. Cholera is a treatable disease contracted through drinking dirty water. But it is something much of Somaliland's 4.5 million population have had to resort to as they stand on the brink of starvation. With more than half their livestock wiped out and no rain for 3 years, people consume whatever water they can find, even if it is contaminated by human waste or rotting animal carcasses. ITV News also spoke to a father who has lost 3 of his children to cholera, \"a father who had to bury 3 young children, who were only yesterday 6 Aug 2017 calling me dad and playing with me.\" That is what has driven him to educate others about cholera so that they don't have to go through the devastation he has.

The 1st 2 cases of cholera were tested positive by National Institute of Health Islamabad on Mon 31 Jul 2017 and another 2 confirmed positive for the infection on Fri 4 Aug 2017. All the 4 patients were undergoing treatment at Benazir Bhutto Hospital BH where as many as 4 more suspects of the infection have been admitted for treatment. Data collected by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017 reveals that the allied hospitals have sent stool samples of over 10 child patients to NIH for confirmation of cholera in last week week of Sun 6 Aug 2017. On Sat 12 Aug 2017, as many as 20 child patients with severe diarrhoea were admitted at the BBH of which 4 were suspected as patients of cholera and their stool samples were sent to NIH for confirmation, said Associate Professor of Paediatrics at Rawalpindi Medical University Dr Tariq Saeed when contacted by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017. He added the hospital has not received confirmation reports from the NIH because of holidays there from Saturday to Monday. However, we have been keeping the suspects in isolation under strict monitoring, he said. He added that repeated rainfalls in the region and water inundation inside and outside homes in a number of localities particularly in thickly populated areas of the city are causing contamination of water and foodstuff that increases chances of spread of a number of infections among population while children are at greater risk of contracting life-threatening infections including cholera. It is important that the transmission of cholera occurs primarily by drinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the feces (waste product) of an infected person, including one with no apparent symptoms. It is observed that heavy rainfall causes collection of heavily contaminated water in streets and houses and the waste water flooding out of various nullahs watercourses including Nullah Leh in town causes infections including cholera, typhoid, dysentery, gastroenteritis, hepatitis A and E, shigellosis and giardiasis. Professor Tariq said the consumption of contaminated water and foodstuff causes cholera, an infection in the small intestine caused by bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. Its main symptoms are watery diarrhea and vomiting that can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, and death in cases which are not treated in time, he said. Health experts say that to avoid cholera and other infections, one must use boiled water for drinking and should use vegetables after washing with clean water and it must be kept in mind that raw vegetables should not be eaten in the existing weather conditions instead these should be used after cooking. To a query, Professor Tariq said the heavy rainfall and water accumulation may contaminate water at sources and there may be chances of contamination of water at tube wells so individuals must boil water before drinking to avoid cholera and other infections. He added the appearance of cholera is alarming and it is time for people to take extra ordinary preventive measures to safeguard their children and themselves from the disease. In case water is accumulated inside home due to heavy rainfall and flooded out of sewage lines, it must be wiped out immediately and the space should be washed with clean water as soon as possible to avoid infections. Avoiding inundation of contaminated water inside homes is a must to avoid cholera and other infections, said Professor Tariq.

JAMA. 2017; 318(8): 689. doi:10.1001/jama.2017.<br><br><strong>11200 </strong><br> Researchers funded in part by the National Institutes of Health have recently demonstrated that 2 experimental vaccines can restrict transmission of Zika virus from pregnant mice to their fetuses, thereby shielding offspring from congenital damage or death. Multiple candidate Zika vaccines have been shown protective against infection with the virus in animal studies, with several now in human trials, but none were tested in the context of pregnancy, according to the authors of the study published in Cell  . The 2 vaccine candidates investigated in the new study are the 1st to demonstrate efficacy in preventing vertical transmission of the virus and related fetal death in an animal model. Although the vaccines were administered to female mice prior to pregnancy, the result is considered an important step toward developing a vaccine that could be safely given to pregnant women. One of the 2 candidates is a modified messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine encoding Zika genes, developed by the biotechnology company Moderna. It is already in safety trials in women who are not pregnant. The other is a live-attenuated Zika strain developed by researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). The testing was carried out by scientists from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Washington University School of Medicine, and UTMB. The researchers 1st vaccinated the mice with 1 of the vaccines or a placebo. After mating, the animals were challenged with the virus 6 days into pregnancy. A week later, more than 50 percent of placentas and fetuses from mice administered the mRNA vaccine had virtually no Zika RNA. The remainder had \"substantially lower\" levels relative to placebo. The live vaccine provided broader protection: 78 percent of placentas and 83 percent of fetuses had Zika RNA at or below the level of detection, while the placebo group exhibited significantly higher levels of placental and fetal Zika RNA. Mice vaccinated with either vaccine had significantly higher rates of fetal viability; whereas 100 percent of fetuses from mice vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine were born, none survived to term in the placebo group. A working group funded by the Wellcome Trust recently approved ethical guidelines for testing such vaccines in pregnant women, normally excluded from drug trials.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. It is reassuring to learn that at least 2 vaccines are now entering clinical trials in women.

Shipped from Amsterdam to Miami after participating in Sweden and UK An American dressage horse returning to the United States after a competition tour in Europe could be euthanized or shipped back out of the country after testing positive for glanders during routine USDA equine import quarantine. Glanders is a highly contagious upper respiratory disease that can be passed from horse-to-horse as well as to human handlers. Acute clinical signs include fever; cough; difficulty breathing; nasal discharge; swollen and painful submaxillary lymph nodes (the \"glands\" in \"glanders\"); rapidly spreading ulcers on the nasal mucosa, nodules, and chronic abscesses; and small abscesses in the lung and/or abscesses in the liver or spleen, among others. Clinical signs of chronic glanders include coughing; malaise; weight loss; intermittent fever; possible thick nasal discharge, usually out of one nostril; ulcers and nodules on the nasal mucosa; enlarged submaxillary lymph nodes; chronic enlargement and induration (hardening) of lymphatics and lymph nodes; joint swelling and painful leg edema (fluid swelling); and nodules, particularly on the legs, that rupture, release pus, and ulcerate. Glanders has been eradicated from North American and was last reported in the United States in the 1940s. It's recently been reported in several areas around the world, however, including South America, Eastern Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and a rare case in Germany in 2014. Earlier this month August 2017, the 18-year-old Dutch Warmblood gelding Sagacious HF was shipped from Amsterdam to the Miami International Airport after participating in competitions in Sweden and England with Chase Hickok. Under USDA rules, all horses entering the United States, except those coming from Canada, must be quarantined and tested for 4 diseases  dourine, glanders, equine piroplasmosis, and equine infectious anemia  upon arrival. Jeanine Neskey, interim public affairs specialist for the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), said an animal that produces a positive test result is denied entry to the United States. \"Denied entry means that it must be either removed from the U.S. or be euthanized,\" she said. \"If the horse is denied entry into the U.S. (and not euthanized), the owner is free to take the horse to any other country that will accept it.\" Scott Leibsle, DVM, Idaho's deputy state veterinarian, said Sagacious could have contracted the disease through contaminated feed or through water buckets also used by other horses participating in competitions. The gelding might also have been an asymptomatic carrier of the disease, possibly developing signs after experiencing stress \"Transport is the most stressful thing you can do to a horse,\" he said. \"At the same time, you're putting it with new animals in a new area, and putting it under the stress of competition.\" Currently APHIS uses a complement fixation test (CFT) to detect glanders. However, the agency is evaluating other testing methods, including the Western Blot procedure. \"Advancing research and improved technology continue to develop new or improved testing methods for animal diseases,\" Neskey said. \"USDA routinely evaluates all testing methods available and incorporates the methods most appropriate to the needs of import quarantine testing.\" After Sagacious produced a 2nd positive CFT glanders test, he produced a negative Western Blot glanders test. Arrangements were made to place him on extended quarantine pending the results of additional testing with both tests, slated for Wed 23 Aug 2017. Byline: Pat Raia  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail Glanders, also known as farcy, is a contagious infectious disease of equines, acute or chronic, usually fatal, caused by the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_, and characterized by the development of ulcerated nodules that are most commonly found in the upper airway, lungs ,and skin. Felines and other animals are susceptible to infection, which is usually fatal. Humans can be infected and the microorganism (_B. mallei_) is considered a potential bioterrorism agent. The disease, one among the oldest known and that used to be prevalent worldwide, is currently eradicated or effectively controlled in many countries. Recently the disease has been reported in some countries, including Iraq, Turkey, Pakistan, India, Mongolia, China, Brazil, United Arab Emirates, and countries in Africa. Glanders is one of the diseases contained in the list of diseases for mandatory reporting to the World Animal Health Organization (OIE). The bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_ a clonal pathogen, can be found in nasal secretions and skin ulcers of infected animals. The transmission of glanders occurs commonly from intake of water or food contaminated with nasal secretions and exudates eliminated from infected animals, contact with contaminated equipment (saddles, harness) and by eating contaminated equine meat. In the nasal form, nodules arise in septum and turbinates. Nodules progress to irregular edged ulcers; star-shaped scars are characteristic after the resolution of the ulcers. In the early stage, submandibular lymph nodes are enlarged and edematous, adhering to the skin and deep tissues in advanced stages of the disease. In the pulmonary form, inflammatory nodules with caseous or calcified centers are found in the lungs. With the progression of the disease areas of consolidation and pneumonia may be present. The nodules may break and eliminate the inflammatory content into the bronchial tree, spreading the infection to the upper respiratory tract. In the cutaneous form, nodules arise along the lymphatic vessels, especially on the extremities. The nodules may degenerate to form ulcers with drainage of highly infectious purulent material. The liver and spleen may have typical nodular lesions. Histologically, vasculitis, thrombosis, inflammatory cell infiltration and degeneration can be seen. A test based on complement fixation can also be used for screening, but the ELISA test, although more sensitive, is not being routinely used. PCR can be used for specific identification ( ). There are no vaccines. Prevention and control depend on early detection and eliminating infected animals in addition to quarantine and complete disinfection. Treatment, administered only in endemic areas, which does not lead to microbiological cure, is the use of doxycycline, ceftazidime, gentamycin, or streptomycin. Sulfa drugs (including in combination with trimethoprim) seem to be effective in prevention and glanders treatment ( ). For glanders-free countries, there are OIE recommendations on importing equines. An international veterinary certificate is required attesting that the animals showed no clinical signs of glanders and were kept in an exporting country free of the disease for at least 6 months prior to shipment ( ). It appears foreign horse owners will not be able to comply, therefore will be unable to repatriate their show horses? Further information would be welcome. As a horse owner, this would be devastating. We certainly hope Sagacious test later this month August 2017 clears him of this disease. - Mod.TG   .

Emerg Microbes Infect. 2017; 6(8): e69. doi: 10.1038/emi.2017.<br><br><strong>59  Abstract </strong><br> Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has recently been associated with an increased incidence of neonatal microcephaly and other neurological disorders. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito bite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some cases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main vector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other mosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the virus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit ZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of laboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. Interestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the midgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in Recife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially fed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx. quinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced. Collectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range of ZIKV vectors than anticipated.  <br><br>Communicated by: Roland Hübner Superior Health Council Brussels Belgium Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active virus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their ability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step toward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_ fed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in saliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing. The study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a competent vector. Several other studies have shown this species to be inefficient vectors or refractory to Zika virus infection. One wonders if the specific _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ used or the Zika virus isolates with which they were tested could account for these very different results. Resolving these discrepancies is important because this mosquito species is very widely distributed around the world and bears directly on risk of outbreaks in geographic areas where _Aedes aegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_ , Zika virus vectors, do not occur. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"68":{"title":"Mumps update (24): Australia (QL), New Zealand (OT),\r\n\tBrazil (AM) ","date":["18","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Mumps update (24): Australia (QL), New Zealand (OT),\r\n\tBrazil (AM) [EXTERNAL]","summary":" 3 Brazil (Manaus, Amazonas)  Fri 18 Aug 2017 Source: Em Tempo in Portuguese, trans. & summ., edited With 230 cases of mumps in Manaus Amazonas state in 19 places, registered since April 2017, mainly in schools, the Municipal Health Department (Semsa) warns parents to keep the updated immunization booklet for children and adolescents.

Given the outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections in the region, and the clinical similarity of cases of that virus infection and CHIKV infection, one wonders how many cases that were not laboratory confirmed but clinically diagnosed as ZIKV infections were, in reality, CHIKV infections. It is also possible that a significant proportion of the population have been infected by CHIKV in the previous 3 years and are now immune. It seems likely, however, that CHIKV is now endemic in the Americas, and sporadic, small outbreaks may continue to occur as they do in Asia and Africa. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"99":{"title":"Yellow fever - Americas (56): French Guiana ","date":["22","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH/EDR> Yellow fever - Americas (56): French Guiana [EXTERNAL]","summary":"   Tue 22 Aug 2017, 11:43 PM Source: SFR France-Antilles in French, trans.

It is a woman who stayed in the forest towards Saint-Élie and Oiapoque, in the border area with Brazil. The Institute Pasteur of Guiana yesterday Mon 21 Aug 2017 confirmed yellow fever virus infection in Guiana, for the 1st time since 1998. The infected person died on 9 Aug 2017. She could have been infected in the border area of Oiapoque in Brazil, according to the initial investigations of the ARS (Agence Regional de Santé; regional health agency). She had been in the forest near St Elie and in the Oyapock Valley. The mosquito control department of the CTG Collectivité Territoriale de Guyane  official name of French Guiana began its mosquito control operations around the identified places of transit of the deceased patient: the Cayenne hospital centre, the Kourou medical and surgical centre; the surrounding forest of Saint-Élie; degradation of Petit Saut; the lower Oyapock. The ARS recommends that unvaccinated people who present with symptoms and who have visited the area since 15 Aug 2017 should consult their doctor without delay. Unvaccinated people can be vaccinated at most general practitioners and at the following centres: - CPS of the Red Cross, - traveller centre or CDPS of the Centre Hospitalier de Cayenne, - PMI centers of the CTG. The ARS reminds all that vaccination is the main prevention measure against yellow fever.<br><br><strong> Transmission to humans, symptoms and treatments: </strong><br> Yellow fever is an acute viral disease transmissible from animal (monkey) to man and man to man by various mosquitoes (genus _Aedes_, but also other genera circulating in the forest). The yellow fever virus is transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito. After an incubation period of about one week, the disease is characterized by fever, chills, muscle pain, headache, nausea, vomiting. Severe forms (hemorrhage, liver disorders, kidney problems) can develop in 15 per cent of cases. Vaccination is the main prevention measure against yellow fever. The vaccine is safe, and very effective, a single dose is usually enough to give lasting immunity and lifetime protection against the disease. In 30 days, it gives an effective immune protection to 99 per cent of vaccinated subjects. In case of yellow fever, symptomatic treatment may be proposed (rehydration, antipyretic medicines to limit fever, vomiting and pain, antibiotics for superinfections). However, French Guiana is endemic for YF and the area where the woman was infected is forested and is likely to have foci of sylvan (forest) YF. Yellow fever was detected in 1951 in French Guiana and YF immunization has been compulsory there since 1967. In the year 2000, a cluster survey showed that immunization coverage in the population was estimated at 80-90 per cent, depending on the age category  . The last case of autochthonous YF notified in Guiana before the one cited above occurred in 1998 in a town on the border with Surinam. Since then, the compulsory notification system built around all health care structures and a reference laboratory at Cayenne's Pasteur Institute have received no notification of Yellow fever cases until now. Health authorities in French Guiana are wise to emphasize vaccination as the best preventive measure against YF. - Mod.TY   .

Oropouche has adapted to urban environments and is moving ever closer to Brazil's major cities. An arbovirus transmitted by a mosquito (like Zika and yellow fever), Oropouche causes acute fever and may lead to meningitis and meningoencephalitis (inflammation of the brain and meninges). \"Oropouche is a virus that could potentially emerge at any moment and cause a serious public health problem in Brazil,\" said Luiz Tadeu Moraes Figueiredo, a professor at the University of São Paulo's Ribeirão Preto Medical School (FMRP-USP). Figueiredo is a researcher for a Thematic Project supported by the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) focusing on emerging zoonotic viroses. According to him, about 500 000 cases of Oropouche fever have been reported in Brazil in recent decades but that the number of cases will grow because the virus, transmitted by the midge _Culicoides paraensis_, is no longer found only in Amazonian villages and is spreading to the big cities. \"_C. paraensis_ is distributed throughout the Americas, and Oropouche virus therefore has considerable emergence potential,\" he said. \"The virus may well spread from the Amazon region and central plateau to the most densely populated regions of the country.\" The incidence of Oropouche fever is also rising in urban areas of Peru and Caribbean countries. In Brazil, the virus has been isolated from birds in Rio Grande do Sul state and from a marmoset in Minas Gerais state. The presence of neutralizing antibodies (which bind to the virus, tell the immune system to destroy it, and prevent it from infecting the organism) has been detected in primates in the city of Goiânia Goiás state. \"We recently diagnosed a patient from Ilhéus city in the northeastern state of Bahia with Oropouche fever, in partnership with Eurico Arruda a professor in FMRP-USP's Department of Cellular Biology. This shows the virus is circulating around Brazil,\" Figueiredo said. In 2002, researchers at FMRP-USP diagnosed 128 people infected by Oropouche virus in Manaus, Amazonas state's capital city. They presented with typical symptoms of the infection, such as acute fever, joint pain, headache, and pain behind the eyes; 3 also developed a central nervous system infection. \"The virus was found in these patients' cerebrospinal fluid,\" Figueiredo said. The researchers were intrigued to find that one of these 3 patients had neurocysticercosis, an infection of the central nervous system caused by the pork tapeworm _Taenia solium_, and another had AIDS. \"This shows that some immunodepressive diseases can facilitate penetration of the central nervous system by the virus. Hardly anyone thinks of this when treating an arbovirus infection, but the possibility must be considered,\" Figueiredo said. The 128 patients with Oropouche in Manaus had been clinically diagnosed with dengue fever. The Oropouche and dengue viruses produce similar symptoms. For this reason, researchers at FMRP-USP and other institutions such as Fundação Oswaldo Cruz Fiocruz have begun to warn that many suspected cases of dengue in Brazil may be cases of infection by Oropouche. The report above indicates that it is spreading, as the biting midge vector, _Culicoides paraensis_, becomes more urbanized in its distribution. The results of blood samples taken in 20 municipalities in Amazonas state indicate the presence of the virus of Oropouche fever. This has been confirmed by Fiocruz Amazonia in an investigation carried out together with state health surveillance. The sampling corresponds to the 2011-2016 period. In total, 306 individuals were investigated, and 9 positives were found among them (see Oropouche virus - Brazil http://promedmail.org/post/20170814.5247798). Surveillance will need to be intensified, with corresponding laboratory support, to be able to differentiate Oropouche virus infection from infections caused by dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. Oropouche virus is a bunyavirus of the Simbu group. No vaccine is available, so avoidance of bites by the vector midge is the best preventive measure. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"190":{"title":"Glanders - Brazil: (TO) equine, human susp, RFI ","date":["23","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH/EDR> Glanders - Brazil: (TO) equine, human susp, RFI [EXTERNAL]","summary":"   Wed 23 Aug 2017 Source: G1 in Portuguese, machine trans., edited The cowboy working on the farm where a case of glanders was confirmed in a horse PRO/PORT Mormo - Brazil (02) (TO), equine, confirmed http://promedmail.org/post/20170823.5270939, is also suspected to have the disease.

It is rare in humans. It is unclear what symptoms occurred in the person and how the diagnosis was made. The following appears to be the most recent review of _B. mallei_ infections in humans including the description of disease manifestations: Van Zandt KE, Greer MT, Gelhaus HC. Glanders: an overview of infection in humans. Orphanet J Rare Dis. 2013 Sep 3;8:131. doi: 10.1186/1750-1172-8-131 (the full text and citations can be found at the original URL  ).<br><br><strong> \"Features of human clinical glanders </strong><br> \"General symptoms \"Many forms of glanders have been described, including chronic, disseminated, pulmonary, and septicemic. The variety of infections is largely explained by various routes of infection. Localized infections are generally regionally confined and typically characterized by foci of suppuration. The abscesses can ulcerate and drain for long periods of time. However, localized infections may disseminate, leading to pulmonary, septicemic, or multi-tissue infection 9. The most common clinical features of the eight laboratory-acquired infections from Fort Detrick included (in order of most common occurrence) afternoon to evening low-grade fever, malaise, fatigue, headache, myalgias including backache, lymphadenopathy, and chest pain. Approximately half of the patients not only felt better but were also clinically better for a period of time after the first wave of disease symptoms. This period lasted from a few days to 2 months then patients developed clinical signs of infection. \"Mucosal involvement \"Involvement of the eye and conjunctiva in a _B. mallei_ infection presents with excessive lacrimation and photophobia. Nasal involvement is characterized by inflammation and swelling of the nose, which is common following inhalation of _B. mallei_. This may be followed by copious nasal discharge. Additionally, infection may invade the nasal septum and bony tissues, causing fistulae and tissue destruction 9. The face may swell and regional lymph nodes may become inflamed. Infection may also extend lower in the respiratory tract, resulting in bronchitis which can be accompanied by cough and mucopurulent sputum production. Constitutional signs and symptoms such as fever and chills typically occur within the first few days following infection. Additionally, these symptoms may persist through treatment and be severe. Common signs and symptoms can include, but are not limited to, fever or low-grade fever in the afternoon to evening; chills with or without rigors; and severe headache 9. \"Cutaneous involvement \"Cutaneous manifestations include papular lesions that may erupt anywhere on the body with a more chronic, indolent course of infection. _B. mallei_ entry through an abrasion is typically followed by an inflammatory response, including pain and swelling. In these cases, a glanders node may appear as a single blister, gradually developing into an ulcer that may become hemorrhagic 18,35. A localized infection with a discharge typically develops at the entry site. Inflammation may extend along regional lymphatics and cause lymphangitis with numerous foci of suppuration along their course. The endotoxins present in _B. mallei_ strains affect the smooth muscle of the lymphatics 9 by enhancing the irritation and inflammation seen in the lymphatics. \"Pulmonary involvement \"A pulmonary infection typically results in pneumonia, pulmonary abscess, pleuritis, and plural effusion. Signs and symptoms of pulmonary infection can include cough, dyspnea, chest pain, and mucoplurent sputum. Nonspecific signs and symptoms such as fatigue, fever (often exceeding 102 deg F 38.9 deg C), chills, headache, myalgias, lymphangitis, sore throat, pleuritic chest pain, cough, tachypnea, dyspnea, discharge, and gastrointestinal signs often accompany respiratory infections 9. Many symptoms may take up to 2 to 3 weeks to develop. Nonspecific signs, such as dizziness, rigors, myalgia, nausea, night sweats, severe headache, tachycardia, weight loss, and mucosal eruptions are also usually present and may indicate a disseminated infection 9. \"Dissemination of infection \"Dissemination from local cutaneous or mucosal infection result in septicemia and the colonization of internal organs such as the spleen, liver, and lungs with the development of abscesses 9. Ultrasonography and computed tomography may reveal multiple, small discrete abscesses in both the liver and the kidney 23. These infections are typically associated with septic shock and high mortality.\" This publication describes what seems to have been the last of the cases of human _B. mallei_ in the USA: Srinivasan A, Kraus CN, DeShazer D, et al. Glanders in a military research microbiologist. N Engl J Med. 2001; 345: 256-8; (full text and citations can be found at the original URL \"Infection with _Burkholderia mallei_ (formerly _Pseudomonas mallei_) can cause a subcutaneous infection known as farcy or can disseminate to cause the condition known as glanders. In humans, acute infection with _B. mallei_ is characterized by necrosis of the tracheobronchial tree, pustular skin lesions, and either a febrile pneumonia, if the organism was inhaled, or signs of sepsis and multiple abscesses, if the skin was the portal of entry (1). At the turn of the 20th century, glanders was an important cause of death among horses, and there were secondary, often fatal, infections in humans (2). Because of the lethal and contagious nature of the disease, _B. mallei_ was considered an ideal agent for biologic warfare and was used for this purpose by Germany in World War I (3). \"Aggressive control measures essentially eliminated glanders from the West. However, with the resurgent concern about biologic warfare, _B. mallei_ is now being studied in laboratories worldwide. We describe here the first reported case of human glanders in the USA in more than 50 years and discuss some of the important events in the history of the disease and its initial eradication.<br><br><strong> \"Case report </strong><br> \"In March 2000, tender, left axillary adenopathy and fever (temperature, 38.6 deg C 101.5 deg F) developed in a 33 year old microbiologist at the US Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases who had type 1 diabetes mellitus. The patient had worked for 2 years investigating the basic microbiology of _B. mallei_ and did not routinely wear latex gloves. The adenopathy and fever persisted despite treatment for 10 days with a first-generation cephalosporin. An evaluation after this treatment, which included chest radiography as well as cultures of blood and urine, was unrevealing. During the next few weeks, the patient had increasing fatigue, night sweats, malaise, rigors, and weight loss. \"In early April 2000, his symptoms and adenopathy resolved during a 10-day course of clarithromycin, but he relapsed 4 days after the medication was stopped. On 2 May 2000, he was admitted to his local hospital with diabetic ketoacidosis. A computed tomographic (CT) scan showed multiple hepatic and splenic abscesses. \"On 4 May 2000, respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation developed, and the patient was transferred to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. Physical examination revealed a temperature of 40.3 deg C 104.5 deg F and a heart rate of 122 beats per minute. The patient had a grade 2/6 systolic murmur, coarse breath sounds, and moderate epigastric tenderness. Laboratory studies showed a white-cell count of 8300 per cubic millimeter, with 83 per cent neutrophils, 9 per cent monocytes, and 8 per cent lymphocytes. The hematocrit was 25.6 per cent. The concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were 53 U per liter and 56 U per liter, respectively, and the alkaline phosphatase was 197 IU per liter. Cultures of the patient's blood and a sample from a fine-needle aspiration biopsy of a liver abscess grew a small, bipolar, weakly staining, gram-negative rod that was identified by an automated bacterial-identification system as _Pseudomonas fluorescens_ or _P. putida_. However, gas-liquid chromatography of the cellular fatty acids (Microbial ID, Newark, Del.) placed the organism in the genus _Burkholderia_. Subsequent phenotypic testing and 16S ribosomal RNA gene-sequence analysis identified the organism as _B. mallei_. Initial susceptibility testing showed the isolate to be sensitive to imipenem, ceftazidime, and tetracycline. \"The patient was treated with imipenem and doxycycline, and there was rapid improvement. After two weeks, the imipenem was replaced by azithromycin, and the patient completed a six-month course of treatment with azithromycin and doxycycline. Although the organism was found retrospectively to be relatively resistant to azithromycin, a CT scan obtained after six months of treatment showed substantial improvement of the liver and spleen abscesses, and one year later the patient remained in good health.<br><br><strong> \"Discussion -</strong><br> This is the 1st reported human case of glanders in the English-language medical literature since 1949 (4) and it occurred in the context of research on agents of biologic warfare. \"Glanders may have been the first biologic weapon of the 20th century. During World War I, Germany had a program of biologic sabotage against several countries, including the United States, whereby cultures of _B. mallei_ and anthrax were distributed to undercover agents who attempted to infect livestock that were to be shipped to Allied countries (3). The intention was both the destruction of livestock and the transmission of the highly contagious, lethal agent from livestock to humans. It is currently suspected that attempts are being made to develop an aerosolized form of antibiotic-resistant _B. mallei_ that could become a biologic weapon as potent as anthrax. \"Glanders, an important human and veterinary disease, was eliminated without a vaccine or effective treatment. It appears to have been abolished by the veterinary use of a skin test to detect exposure to B. mallei combined with draconian agricultural measures to control infection (5). \"At the turn of the 20th century, Canada, Britain, and the USA all implemented glanders-control programs. By that time, the symptoms of equine glanders, which include fever and inflammation of the nasal mucosa with ultimate necrosis and obstruction of the oropharynx, had been well described (6). Laws were passed that required notification of the health department and the immediate slaughter of affected animals, with proper disposal of the carcasses. In addition, all horses on the premises where the infected horses were found had to be tested with the mallein skin test for exposure to _B. mallei_; any horses with a reaction also had to be slaughtered. Horses with no reaction were quarantined and then retested two to three weeks later. Furthermore, the equine contacts of the horses were traced to track down other horses that might have been exposed and then moved to other facilities. \"The case we describe illustrates the major clinical features of glanders, which can usually be traced to direct contact with _B. mallei_, as in workers exposed to animals with glanders (7) and in personnel who were exposed in laboratories during World War II (8). Although the patient discussed here could not recall a clear break in his skin or an accident in the laboratory, most reported occupational infections occur without recognized instances of exposure (9). As Robins commented in 1906, \"It is perhaps not advisable to be too dogmatic as to the invariable necessity of an abrasion being present in every case of human glanders . . . as in several such cases of our series it is distinctly stated that there was no abrasion.\" (7). As in our patient, _B. mallei_ often enters the body through the hand or arm. After an incubation period lasting between a few days and several weeks, local suppuration and regional lymphadenopathy occur. Constitutional symptoms often accompany the infection, with fever, rigors, and malaise predominating. If the infection is left untreated, abscesses in the lymph nodes will generally form, then break down and drain. \"Dissemination of the infection occurs 1 to 4 weeks after infection of the lymph nodes. Abscesses can be widespread, and _B. mallei_ can infect almost any tissue (7). Abscesses in the liver and the spleen, as were seen in our patient, appear to be relatively common, as does pulmonary involvement, including consolidation, abscesses, and pleural nodules. The acute onset and rapid resolution of the respiratory failure in our patient were more consistent with the respiratory distress syndrome associated with gram-negative bacteremia than with that associated with pulmonary glanders. Subcutaneous and intramuscular abscesses sometimes develop as well (7). \"There are few data regarding the antibiotic treatment of glanders, since the disease had largely disappeared by the time antibiotics became available. In vitro, ceftazidime, gentamicin, imipenem, doxycycline, and ciprofloxacin all have reliable activity against _B. mallei_ (10), and our patient's infection responded well to a combination of imipenem and doxycycline. Experimentally induced glanders also responds to a combination of sulfazine and trimethoprim (11). However, treatment of the disease in the setting of bioterrorism may be more difficult if the organism is drug-resistant. \"This case demonstrates the difficulties that microbiology laboratories may have in recognizing potential agents of biologic warfare. These microbes are rarely encountered and may be misidentified by conventional, phenotypic identification systems. Techniques such as cellular analysis of fatty acid and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing can be used to identify the organisms correctly, but these tests are not widely available. \"Finally, this case may serve as a harbinger of the resurgence of nearly forgotten diseases such as glanders, plague, smallpox, and anthrax. Research on these diseases is now being conducted in more laboratories, which increases the risk of occupational exposure. There is also the looming threat that some group will eventually mount a successful campaign of bioterrorism. Resources must be allocated both to prevent and to prepare for these frightening possibilities. The state of Tocantins is located in central Brazil. - Mod.LL ","keywordsMatched":[]},"454":{"title":"Botulism - Slovakia: st A3, 2015 ","date":["10","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Botulism - Slovakia: st A3, 2015 [EXTERNAL]","summary":"<br><br><strong>   Thu 10 Aug 2017 Source: Eurosurveillance Volume 22, Issue 32 edited Reoccurrence of botulinum neurotoxin subtype A3 inducing foodborne botulism, Slovakia, 2015 -</strong><br> The life-threatening illness botulism is caused by 7 serotypes (A-G) of botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT), however only serotypes A, B, E and F cause disease in humans. BoNTs prevent neurotransmitter release and lead to a flaccid paralysis. There are 3 main forms of human botulism: food-borne, wound and infant botulism 1,2. The BoNTs are produced by 6 phylogenetically and physiologically distinct bacteria (_Clostridium botulinum_ Groups I-IV, and strains of _C. baratii_ and _C. butyricum_) which are so diverse as to merit classification as different species. All of the BoNT-producing _Clostridium_ species have non BoNT-producing counterparts (not harboring the BoNT gene cluster) which are often assigned to different species names, such as _C. sporogenes_ for _C. botulinum_ Group I strains 2. This polyphyly of _C. botulinum_ together with its close relationship to non-toxigenic species can result either in the erroneous detection of toxigenic _Clostridium_ species or failure thereof. The BoNT gene cluster is often associated with mobile genetic elements, allowing for interconversion between toxigenic and nontoxigenic _Clostridium_ species, and leading to substantial variation in BoNT sequences and their genomic backgrounds 3. Today, the BoNT serotypes are divided into more than 40 subtypes, including BoNT/A1 to BoNT/A8 4, and mosaic forms 5. The BoNT diversity at the amino acid level can reach up to 36 percent within a serotype and is reflected by differences in their catalytic activity, receptor binding or pharmacokinetics 6. In addition to containing the gene for BoNT, the BoNT gene cluster contains the gene for the non-toxic non-haemagglutinin (NTNH) protein. The BoNT gene cluster also harbors either 3 hemagglutinin (HA) genes (ha1, ha2 and ha3) in the HA cluster or 3 orfX genes (orfX1, orfX2 and orfX3) in the orfX cluster. Together with BoNT, these accessory proteins can form complexes of varying size and composition 7. The variability observed in BoNTs due to the existence of 7 serotypes, mosaic forms, several different subtypes and the occurrence of BoNT in different complexes, as well as their heterogeneous genetic background are probably the main reasons for the spectrum of clinical presentations and disease duration associated with botulism, and pose a tremendous challenge to diagnostic laboratories 8. Botulism is associated with a wide variety of foods that are rich in protein and kept under the partial exclusion of oxygen, or in an environment where oxygen has been depleted by other bacteria. Marinated meat, fish, fruits, vegetables or mushrooms as well as home-canned products and home-cured or smoked meat or fish products, which are consumed unheated, are particularly known sources. BoNTs are heat-labile and can be destroyed by temperatures above 70 C 158 F in minutes 9,10. Nowadays, foodborne botulism is almost exclusively associated with home-produced foods, but commercial food products are occasionally involved in single cases or small outbreaks 11-13. Between 2010-2014, ECDC reported 492 cases in Europe 14, with the last case occurring in Slovakia in 2012 15.<br><br><strong> The event -</strong><br> In mid-August 2015 (day 0), an otherwise healthy adult in their 40s consumed, for dinner, 3 packs (100 g each) 3.52 ounces of a commercial hummus spread. The hummus, which was sold in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, had a best-before date of 9 days after consumption. The following morning (day 1), 9-11 hours after consumption of the hummus, the patient experienced nausea, vomiting, double vision, unsteady gait, dizziness, generalized weakness and difficulties swallowing, and was admitted to hospital. Despite receiving 3 doses of equine trivalent anti-A, B and E antitoxin, the patient felt into a coma on day 2 and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). As botulism is a mandatory notifiable disease in Slovakia, the clinic reported the suspected botulism case to local health authorities. A gastric lavage, but neither serum nor stool, was taken on day 2 and stored at 4 C 39.2 F for further analysis. After one week of storage, the gastric lavage was sent to the Public Health Institute in Ostrava, Czech Republic where it tested negative by mouse bioassay. Treatment consisted mainly of intensive symptomatic care and respiratory support for almost 50 days. The patient was discharged from hospital after 78 days, but still complained about breathing problems as of their last follow-up in May 2017.<br><br><strong> Methods: Epidemiological investigation -</strong><br> On day one, after being notified by the clinic, the regional health authorities started an epidemiological investigation by interviewing the hospitalized patient. The next day, day 2, the patient's household was inspected to check for additional cases and to collect food samples. There, a close relative who shares the same household was interviewed, a list of food items consumed by the patient over the last days was recorded and suspicious food items were collected. In cooperation with the Slovak State Veterinary and Food Administration (SVPS), an investigation on the composition and the origin of the ingredients used for production of the hummus was conducted at the food processing facility.<br><br><strong> Laboratory investigation </strong><br> Isolation of _Clostridium botulinum_ from hummus and molecular analysis. Small particles of hummus left on the packaging of the 3 nearly empty hummus tubes were streaked on tryptic soy agar and Schaedler agar plates, and subjected to anaerobic culture at 37 C 98.6 F in anaerobic jars following EN ISO 7937:2005. Almost all colonies showed typical clostridia-like morphology and were probed for the presence of bont genes with a multiplex PCR for bont/A, bont/B, bont/E and bont/F 16 according to CEN ISO/TS 17919:2013. Genetic analysis Isolates were transferred to the Consultant laboratory for neurotoxin-producing clostridia (botulism, tetanus), formerly called the Consultant Laboratory for _Clostridium botulinum_, at the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) in Berlin, Germany for further molecular biological investigation. Isolates were grown in tryptone-peptone-glucose-yeast extract (TPGY) medium at 32 C 89.6 F in an anaerobic workstation (MG500, Don Whitley, Shipley, United Kingdom), and tested for the presence of bont/A-G by single and multiplex quantitative PCR 17. In addition, a quantitative PCR was used to test for the ntnh gene as a surrogate marker for BoNT-producing _Clostridium spp._ 18. To further investigate the composition of the BoNT gene cluster, a set of 6 conventional PCRs targeting the 3 ha genes and the 3 orfX genes was applied 19. Toxin production in supernatants was confirmed by in-house ELISA tests as described 20,21. The 16S rRNA and bont/A gene sequences were obtained by Sanger sequencing 22. Sequences were assembled and compared with the GenBank database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information in the United States via Geneious software packages (Biomatters Limited, Auckland, New Zealand) using the BLAST algorithm 23. For subtyping, the amino acid sequence of the BoNT was compared with the 8 known BoNT/A subtypes 4. Sequences of the other BoNT/A subtypes were uploaded into Geneious and pairwise identities of the aligned sequences were calculated using the MAFFT algorithm 24. For comparison, the BoNT subtypes of the following BoNT strains causing food-borne botulism in the past (except for BoNT/A4 which originated from an infant botulism case) were selected (GenBank accession numbers in parenthesis): BoNT/A1 (HA cluster) strain ATCC3502 (AM412317); BoNT/A1 (orfX cluster) strain NCTC2916 (X52066); BoNT/A2 (orfX cluster) strain Mascarpone (DQ310546); BoNT/A3 (orfX cluster) strain Loch Maree (CP000963); BoNT/A4 (orfX cluster) strain 657 (EU341307); BoNT/A5 (HA cluster) strain 1430.11 (KC683799); BoNT/A6 (orfX cluster) strain CDC41370 (FJ981696); BoNT/A7 (unknown cluster) strain 2008-148 (JQ954969); BoNT/A8 (orfX cluster) strain Chemnitz (KM233166). Further microbiological investigation In order to identify additional possibly contaminated products of the same production date, the Regional Authority of Public Health (RAPH) in Banska Bystrica investigated the products' availability at several local supermarkets and the food bank. While no additional hummus was available from the food bank, 3 tubes of hummus with the same production date as the ones consumed were obtained from a supermarket. Unopened products were stored at 37 C 98.6 F for several days to reach suitable conditions for _C. botulinum_/_C. sporogenes_ germination and growth.<br><br><strong> Results -</strong><br> Epidemiological investigation: Results from the interview revealed that on day 0, the patient alone ate scrambled eggs for breakfast; the patient, a close relative and a friend shared the same meal of mushrooms in cream sauce with pasta for lunch; and the patient alone ate the hummus at dinner after obtaining it from a food bank. The interview of the patient and a close relative revealed that one tube of the hummus product showed gas production prior to being opened, but it tasted normal according to the patient. The epidemiologists notified the Regional Veterinary and Food Administration of the Slovak Republic and the 3 nearly empty tubes of hummus and 2 unopened packs of a commercial ready-to-eat sauerkraut and vegetarian sausage meal, from the same company as the hummus, were sent for laboratory investigation. Neither the scrambled eggs nor the pasta dish were available for sampling. An investigation at the producing company revealed that the hummus product consisted of the following ingredients: chick peas, tofu, rapeseed oil, onion, salt, maize starch and spices. It also revealed that the chick peas originated from Brazil or Argentina. Laboratory investigation: RAPH received the collected food items, including the 3 opened and nearly empty 100 g 3.52 ounces hummus tubes. Three strains with typical _C. botulinum_ morphology (designated Banska Bystrica, RAPH1223j and RAPH1224) were isolated, one from each tube. Two of them, Banska Bystrica and RAPH1223j, were PCR-positive for the bont/A gene. The vegetarian sausage and sauerkraut meal tested negative for the presence of _C. botulinum_ and the bont/A gene. On day 7, as soon as the 1st results were available, the hummus was withdrawn from the market and a Food and Feed Safety Alert was issued through the European Commission's Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF). The 3 unopened hummus tubes with the same production date that were obtained from a supermarket were subjected to 37 C 98.6 F storage. Microbiological analysis and PCR testing did not reveal the presence of _C. botulinum_ or _C. sporogenes_ despite some signs of gas formation during storage. Molecular biological characterisation of isolated strains: The sequences of the 16S rRNA gene analysed at RKI revealed that all 3 isolates (strains Banska Bystrica, RAPH1223j and RAPH1224) belonged to _C. botulinum_ Group I/_C. sporogenes_ (greater than 99 percent identity), which are almost indistinguishable at the 16S rRNA sequence level 2,25. The presence of bont/A and ntnh genes was confirmed by quantitative PCR, and expression of the toxin was shown by an in-house ELISA for isolates Banska Bystrica and RAPH1223j. From the 2 BoNT/A-positive isolates, the BoNT/A sequences were obtained and compared with GenBank entries at the nucleotide (nt) and the amino acid level. Both toxigenic isolates (Banska Bystrica and RAPH1223j) were found to harbor a bont/A gene of identical sequence; the bont/A sequence of one strain, Banska Bystrica, was submitted to GenBank under accession number KU376389. It showed the highest identity (greater than or equal to 99.6 percent) to bont/A sequences of the unusual subtype BoNT/A3. Table one shows the distances computed against all BoNT/A subtypes at the nt and the amino acid levels for Table, see original URL - Mod.LL. Compared with the prototype BoNT/A1, the BoNT of the new BoNT/A-positive isolates, Banska Bystrica and RAPH1223j, had an identity at the amino acid level of only 84.6 percent (compared with BoNT/A1 strain ATCC3502; HA cluster) or 84.5 percent (compared with BoNT/A1 strain NCTC2916; orfX cluster). Similar low amino acid level identities (between 84.3 percent and 87.7 percent) were found when compared with BoNT subtypes A4-A8, whereas amino acid level identity with subtype A2 (strain Mascarpone) was 92.9 percent. Sequence identities at the nt level were generally higher, but still diverged by up to 8.5 percent. Both isolates (Banska Bystrica and RAPH1223j) were negative for the ha1, ha2 and ha3 genes and positive for the orfX1, orfX2 and orfX3 genes by PCR; this is in agreement with the BoNT/A3 strain Loch Maree in which the bont/A gene is located in the orfX cluster.<br><br><strong> Discussion </strong><br> Our laboratory investigations support the diagnosis of a case of foodborne botulism caused by the unusual BoNT subtype A3 in food consumed by the patient. To our knowledge, this is only the 2nd time that this subtype was involved in foodborne botulism since 8 people died from contaminated wild duck paste in Loch Maree, Scotland in 1922 26. No other strain belonging to this specific A3 subtype was isolated or subtyped for nearly a century until Luquez and colleagues identified 3 strains from Argentina (in soil and salad) in 2012 27. Interestingly, the 2 described BoNT/A-positive isolates have an identical BoNT/A sequence at the amino acid level as one of the strains (CDC54054) isolated from Argentinian soil 27, and the chick peas used in the hummus consumed by the patient originated from South America, either from Brazil or Argentina. Initially, suspected botulism could not be confirmed by testing the gastric lavage taken on day 2. Considering the acidity and proteolytic activity, as well as the length of storage, the gastric lavage taken after emesis on day one was not an ideal sample. Serum and stool samples, which have been proposed to be the most reliable samples for diagnostic testing 28, might not have been collected, because of a lack of testing facilities and inexperienced clinical personnel, particularly since botulism is a rare disease and no cases have been notified in Slovakia since 2012 15. For the clinician, it is important to consider the optimal timing when choosing samples for botulism diagnosis. Despite demonstration of BoNT in serum as one of the key tests to confirm botulism, the time period in which BoNT can be detected from serum is usually limited to the 1st few days after oral ingestion. However, confirmation of BoNT-producing _Clostridium_ species (spores) from feces can often be achieved over a more prolonged period (up to two weeks) 28,29. Therefore, co-examination of serum and stool is recommended to confirm clinical cases of food-borne botulism 28-31. The mere detection of _C. botulinum_ from feces without clinical symptoms does not imply the presence of botulism given that _C. botulinum spores_ are not usually detected in the feces of healthy humans. However, on rare occasions, spores that have been ingested with naturally contaminated food (e.g. honey, fresh vegetables) might be detected in the feces of otherwise healthy people 28. In our case, foodborne botulism could only be confirmed by the isolation of _C. botulinum_ from 2 of the 3 consumed tubes of hummus. It is always hard to exclude that the analyzed food become cross-contaminated in the household with _C. botulinum_ by handling with kitchen utensils contaminated via another food. However, there was no indication that the hummus became cross-contaminated within the patient's household. In the aftermath of the current botulism case, 3 unopened hummus tubes with the same production date were subjected to 37 C 98.6 F storage and analyzed for the presence of _C. botulinum_ without any positive result. It is not unusual that _C. botulinum_ cannot be detected from other items of the same lot. In 3 botulism outbreaks in Europe in 2011, which involved commercial olive tapenade, almond-stuffed olives and korma sauce, _C. botulinum_ and BoNT could only be identified from one or 2 opened jars/pots obtained from the households, but not from any unopened jars/pots from the same lot (consisting of 60, 900, and 1836 items, respectively) that were tested 11,32-34. These cases indicate that even in modern industrialized food production, contamination of a single or a very few items within a lot cannot be completely excluded. In all those cases, consumer protection had utmost priority and food recalls were issued solely on the basis of positive results from the remaining product in the open containers from the affected households to prevent a potential spread of the disease 32-34. Hummus has been involved in a foodborne botulism outbreak in the past, possibly due to incorrect storage temperature 35 C 95 F. Whether this was the case in the event presented here could not be determined, but the patient did notice gas formation in the products. This might be indicative of spoilage as growth of _C. botulinum_ in spoiled products is often associated with gas production, e.g. foaming, bulging of cans 36. However, unlike Group II strains of _C. botulinum_ which can grow at refrigeration temperatures, Group I strains (to which this study's isolated strains belong) require growth temperatures above 10 C 50 F 2. This suggests that the hummus product was at least partially stored above refrigeration temperatures. Compared with the known 8 BoNT/A subtypes (BoNT/A1 to BoNT/A8 4), the subtype A3 is both very rare and the most distant from the prototype BoNT/A1 (Table 1), being up to 15.4 percent and 8 percent different at the amino acid and nt level, respectively. Notably, because of its amino acid sequence divergence, BoNT/A3 is known to be neutralized less efficiently by polyclonal antibodies generated against BoNT/A1 37. This has led us to speculate that the long lasting neurological effects observed in the patient despite the administration of 3 doses of trivalent antitoxin might at least be partially due to suboptimal neutralization by the antitoxin, which is directed against BoNT/A1. The rareness and divergence of the BoNT/A3 subtype poses the risk that it might not be detected by immunological or sequence-based diagnostic assays that have not been validated against it. In fact, one ELISA has already been shown to be unable to detect it 38. Furthermore, in one 39 of the 4 mentioned PCR methods in ISO ISO/TS 17919:2013, the sequence of one primer and the probe each contain one mismatch towards all BoNT/A3 sequences. These mismatches might therefore hamper identification of strains belonging to the A3 subtype by the corresponding PCR 40,41. Testing laboratories should be aware that strains harboring this rare subtype can occur in European countries and are advised to validate their methods accordingly. Unfortunately, the exchange of BoNT-producing strains and in some instances, even the sharing of their sequence information are restricted because of their nature as possible biowarfare agents and other dual-use concerns 42,43.<br><br><strong> Conclusion </strong><br> Rare and novel BoNT sequence variation can especially easily escape detection by sequence-based or immunological methods. As more sequences become available despite some restrictions, diagnostic facilities should check their PCRs frequently to ensure inclusion of all known sequence variations. As a result of the rareness of botulism, many laboratories have no or only individual assays for detection at hand. Specialized laboratories (e.g. national reference laboratories or consultant laboratories) able to apply a broader range of methods could aid those laboratories, but are often not easily identifiable by the laboratories responsible for testing the samples.

This has been confirmed by Fiocruz Amazonia in an investigation carried out together with state Health Surveillance. The sampling corresponds to the 2011-2016 period. In total, there were 306 individuals investigated, and there were 9 positives among them. The investigation gave negative results for dengue, chikungunya fever, and Zika viruses.

As the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has noted: \"The Oropouche virus exists in nature in 2 cycles, the wild and urban-epidemic cycles. In the wild cycle, wildlife such as primates, sloths, and certain arthropods serve as reservoirs, with the culicoid midge, _Culicoides paraensis_ flies acting as vectors.

Multiple candidate Zika vaccines have been shown protective against infection with the virus in animal studies, with several now in human trials, but none were tested in the context of pregnancy, according to the authors of the study published in Cell  . The 2 vaccine candidates investigated in the new study are the 1st to demonstrate efficacy in preventing vertical transmission of the virus and related fetal death in an animal model. Although the vaccines were administered to female mice prior to pregnancy, the result is considered an important step toward developing a vaccine that could be safely given to pregnant women. One of the 2 candidates is a modified messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine encoding Zika genes, developed by the biotechnology company Moderna. It is already in safety trials in women who are not pregnant. The other is a live-attenuated Zika strain developed by researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). The testing was carried out by scientists from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Washington University School of Medicine, and UTMB. The researchers 1st vaccinated the mice with 1 of the vaccines or a placebo. After mating, the animals were challenged with the virus 6 days into pregnancy. A week later, more than 50 percent of placentas and fetuses from mice administered the mRNA vaccine had virtually no Zika RNA. The remainder had \"substantially lower\" levels relative to placebo. The live vaccine provided broader protection: 78 percent of placentas and 83 percent of fetuses had Zika RNA at or below the level of detection, while the placebo group exhibited significantly higher levels of placental and fetal Zika RNA. Mice vaccinated with either vaccine had significantly higher rates of fetal viability; whereas 100 percent of fetuses from mice vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine were born, none survived to term in the placebo group. A working group funded by the Wellcome Trust recently approved ethical guidelines for testing such vaccines in pregnant women, normally excluded from drug trials.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea: \"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per cent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as \"potentially the most important medical advance\" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5). \"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.<br><br><strong> \"References </strong><br> 1.

Even more troubling, the virus seems to be circulating among displaced populations who frequently uproot and migrate, making it that much harder to contain. Following a recent visit to northeast Nigeria, Dr Philippa Easterbrook, a senior scientist for the WHO's global hepatitis program, spoke to Devex about a recently-developed WHO response plan created to reduce the number of new cases of the virus and provide training to local health workers as a means of improving case management and diagnosis. This water-borne infection was 1st reported in August 2016 in Chad's Samalat region, to the country's southeast. As of July 2017, the country had reported more than 1600 suspected or confirmed cases, and 18 deaths. The virus then surfaced in neighboring Niger in January 2017, in the Diffa region, an area near the Chad and Nigeria borders. Hepatitis E cases here spiked dramatically in mid-April 2017, and decreased before then increasing again. Now approximately 1450 people are suspected to have been infected, more than half of those women, with 38 fatalities. With the frequent movement of internally displaced populations, the infection eventually arrived in Nigeria in May 2017, in Damasak, a town near the Niger border, and has since seen 696 cases total, mostly at the Ngala internally displaced people's camp, near the Cameroon border in Borno state. Currently, all cases of hepatitis E in the Lake Chad region have been among displaced persons and refugees, Easterbrook explained. \"This led us to the working hypothesis that these outbreaks are all linked and related to large population movements,\" she said. Without immediate attention, humanitarians are concerned that the virus could spread even further within impacted countries and even into unaffected areas, such as neighboring Cameroon or the Central African Republic. Even more so, this outbreak is highlighting the unsanitary water conditions affecting those impacted by conflict in the Lake Chad Basin. Hepatitis E is most dangerous in pregnant women, and has an incubation period of 2 to 10 weeks where the infection remains asymptomatic and undetected in most people. Usually symptoms include flu-like symptoms such as: Low-grade fever, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and most notably jaundice. Because the virus carries symptoms also seen in hepatitis A, yellow fever and malaria cases, diagnosing patients and managing cases can be a challenge. Roughly 5 percent of cases develop more serious complications, according to Easterbrook, however the biggest risk is developing acute liver failure, or in pregnant women, post-partum hemorrhaging which can be fatal. The most pressing agenda in the response plan is the improvement of water and sanitation hygiene in the region. As the virus spreads via contaminated water, Easterbrook cited that the improvement of WASH conditions would not only support the reduction in new hepatitis E cases, but could also reduce the prevalence of other infectious diseases, namely hepatitis A, cholera, and typhoid. To date, roughly 200 restrooms and 100 showers have been constructed in Ngala camp. WHO has also worked with local partners to rehabilitate water points and distribute hygiene kits, which include items such as sanitary napkins and water purification tablets, to women and households. However, cultural barriers impede the progress of these initiatives. \"Some people would rather have low-level restroom facilities rather than walk some distance to a more modernized latrine,\" Easterbrook explained.

Homeless populations are at higher risk for GAS infections due to factors including close proximity in shelter settings, limited access to personal hygiene measures, higher rates of infestations (lice, scabies, and bed bugs), and barriers to accessing medical services. Montreal Public Health is collaborating with services for homeless individuals, clinical teams, and community partners to ensure the improvement of health and hygiene measures, the rapid detection of cases, and the clinical management of symptomatic individuals.  Noémie Savard MD Direction régionale de santé publique Le Centre intégré universitaire de santé et de services sociaux (CIUSSS) du Centre-Sud-de-l'Île-de-Montréal Montréal, Quebec Canada ProMED-mail is grateful to Dr Noémie Savard for this description of an outbreak due to group A streptococci genotype emm74 in homeless people in Quebec. GAS can be highly contagious; skin lesions, poor personal hygiene, and crowding in shelters for the homeless would be expected to facilitate its spread from person to person. Some strains of GAS are more virulent than others. Tissue invasiveness of GAS has been attributed to several virulence factors, especially the cell wall M protein, encoded by the _emm_ gene. Strains have been typed based on the antigenic specificity of its M protein. More recently GAS are typed on the basis of sequence analysis of the portion of the _emm_ gene that encodes M serospecificity ( ). Over 200 _emm_ types have been identified. Other molecular techniques to further characterize outbreak strains include pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of chromosomal DNA fragments, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), detection of exotoxin-encoding genes, and whole genome sequencing ( ,  ,  , and  ). Molecular analysis of the isolates aids documenting a common source for an outbreak. An outbreak of invasive GAS disease due genotype emm74 occurred in Toronto recently (see ProMED-mail Streptococcus, group A - Canada (02): (ON) fatal, homeless shelter, emm74, clonal http://promedmail.org/post/20170406.4952247). This _emm_ type was detected initially in December 2015 and in temporal association with this outbreak, there has been a substantial increase in invasive GAS infection due to emm74 in the local community. Genotyping by whole genome sequencing established that the Toronto emm74 outbreak strains were highly clonal (ProMED-mail Streptococcus, group A - Canada (02): (ON) fatal, homeless shelter, emm74, clonal http://promedmail.org/post/20170406.4952247). It would be important to learn if genotyping by whole genome sequencing has been done on the Quebec outbreak strains to see if they match each other and also if they match the Toronto strains. - Mod.ML   .

Cyclosporiasis is the least-common reportable protozoan infection in the United States. In 2008, the reported disease rate among 10 states was 2.25 per 100 000 population. The true incidence of foodborne cyclosporiasis in the United States has been estimated at 11 407 to 19 808 cases per year (15 hospitalizations), accounting for 0.1 percent of all foodborne illness. Approximately 42 percent of cases are imported. 1110 individual cases of cyclosporiasis were reported during 1997 to 2008. 849 (76.5 percent) of the cases occurred in 7 states, including 498 (44.9 percent of total) in Florida. 51.7 percent of cases with known travel history were autochthonous. No fatal cases were reported during 1998 to 2006. During 1998 to 2002, 9 foodborne outbreaks (325 cases) of cyclosporiasis were reported; 0 in 2007; 3 (66 total cases) in 2008; 1 (8 cases) in 2009; 0 in 2010. 11 outbreaks (3533 cases) related to imported food were reported during 1996 to 2014.

Man­itoba Agriculture's Holly Derksen said, \"I think this is probably the most severe that I've seen it.\" It is unclear if there are other, unreported, cases. The virus also may take root in its namesake barley or other cereals like wheat. \"It does seem like this year 2017 there are some bigger patches and when it is a severely infected plant you will not have seed production,\" she said. \"It really depends on the incidence in the field, but if there are big patches that are affected, there could be some significant yield loss.\" Byline: Alexis Stockford  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail Barley yellow dwarf (BYD) disease occurs worldwide and affects a wide range of grass species (Gramineae) including cereal crops like barley, wheat, oats, rice, maize, and rye. It is the most destructive of the virus diseases for wheat. Grain yields may be reduced by 1/3. Symptoms include leaf discolouration from yellow to purple (depending on the host species), stunting, reduced tillering, and empty seed heads. Plants infected in autumn may not survive the winter or show severe symptoms when growth resumes. Diseased plants often occur in circular patches within a field, which are associated with colonisation by the aphid vectors. BYD viruses have now been split into several species in the family Luteoviridae (mostly in the genus _Luteovirus_). They are differentiated by their ability to be transmitted by various aphid species (family Aphididae) and their virulence on a selected variety of oats. Some of the viruses are transmitted equally well by several aphids, whereas others can be transmitted by only one or 2 species. The bird cherry(-oat) aphid (_Rhopalosiphum padi_) and grain (wheat) aphid (_Sitobion avenae_) are vectors of the severe _Barley yellow dwarf virus-PAV_ (type member of genus _Luteovirus_). Coinfections of several BYD viruses may occur in one plant, which can result in either more severe (synergistic) or milder (due to cross protection) symptoms, depending on the virus partners. The viruses cannot be transmitted by seed, pollen, or mechanical means and cannot survive in stubble or in the soil. Volunteer cereal plants or grassy weeds may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management includes use of crop cultivars with reduced sensitivity to the viruses and control of the aphid vectors.

Emerg Microbes Infect. 2017; 6(8): e69. doi: 10.1038/emi.2017.<br><br><strong>59  Abstract </strong><br> Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has recently been associated with an increased incidence of neonatal microcephaly and other neurological disorders. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito bite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some cases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main vector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other mosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the virus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit ZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of laboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. Interestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the midgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in Recife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially fed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx. quinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced. Collectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range of ZIKV vectors than anticipated.  <br><br>Communicated by: Roland Hübner Superior Health Council Brussels Belgium Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active virus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their ability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step toward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_ fed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in saliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing. The study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a competent vector. Several other studies have shown this species to be inefficient vectors or refractory to Zika virus infection. One wonders if the specific _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ used or the Zika virus isolates with which they were tested could account for these very different results. Resolving these discrepancies is important because this mosquito species is very widely distributed around the world and bears directly on risk of outbreaks in geographic areas where _Aedes aegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_ , Zika virus vectors, do not occur. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"92":{"title":"Invasive mosquito - Canada: (ON) ","date":["22","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH> Invasive mosquito - Canada: (ON) [EXTERNAL]","summary":"   Tue 22 Aug 2017, 11:28 AM ET Source: CBC News edited An adult _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, the species responsible for the majority of human Zika virus cases, has been found in Canada for the 1st time. Evidence shows mosquitoes capable of carrying Zika virus may have a colony in Ontario. Staff from the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit recently found the insect in a trap, a discovery health officials believe signals the species is becoming established in southern Ontario. \"It was just in such good shape, we are absolutely 100 per cent sure of what species it is,\" said Fiona Hunter, from Brock University, who heads up the lab that tested Windsor's mosquitoes. \"It didn't just blow in from the (United) States.\" Last week week ending 20 Aug 2017, the health unit revealed 2 _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes, also known as the Asian tiger mosquito, had also been found in the area. \"Once they establish themselves here it would be more difficult to control and maybe we'll see some diseases we haven't seen before,\" said Dr Wajid Ahmed, the region's acting medical officer of health, at the time. Having the Asian tiger mosquito show up in Canada was a bit of a surprise, considering it wasn't expected to migrate north for at least another decade, Hunter explained. But the odds of it arriving is still higher than the latest species. \"The Asian tiger mosquito is known to exist farther north in the (United) States ... but _Aedes aegypti_ is supposed to be sub-tropical and tropical - Mod.TY, so what on earth is it doing here?\" All aedes mosquitoes found in Windsor-Essex so far have tested negative for both the Zika and West Nile virus. Given there are no active cases of the diseases, there's less cause for alarm, according to Hunter. \"I think it's alarming  for the country  that our climate is changing,\" she said. \"In the last decade we've added another 10 mosquito species to our endemic list ... so we know something is going on.\"  communicated by: ProMED-mail Although finding _Aedes aegypti_ in southern Canada is a surprise, one should remember that this tropical and sub-tropical species became seasonally established along the east coast of the USA and was responsible for yellow fever outbreaks in northern cities such as Philadelphia more than 200 years ago. However, it will not become established in Canada for the same reason it has not become established in the north central and north east states of the USA. However, _Aedes albopictus_ distribution is another matter. This species has been extending its known range northward and recently has been found in Nebraska, Connecticut, Indiana, Ohio, Minnesota and Wisconsin, 3 of which border Ontario across the Great Lakes . Unlike _A. aegypti_, _A. albopictus_ eggs can go into diapause and withstand freezing winter temperatures. A University of Wisconsin-Madison entomologist Susan Paskewitz points out that viable populations of this species have not yet become established in these northern states and it seems unlikely that they will in Ontario either. However, continued surveillance for both is prudent. - Mod.TY   .

That being said, there have only been 9 confirmed cases of WPV1 associated paralytic disease worldwide this year (2017), compared with 37 cases reported last year (2016). In contrast there have been 40 confirmed cases of cVDPV2 confirmed this year (2017) compared with 5 last year (2016). As a reminder, outbreaks due to cVDPV's are considered as significant in the big picture of polio eradication, as they are due to vaccine polioviruses that have reverted in neurovirulence following passage through multiple individuals while circulating in the susceptible population. The goal of the polio eradication initiative is to interrupt transmission of both the WPV's and the cVDPVs. The presence of cVDPVs occurs when there are areas with low vaccination coverage where the vaccine virus (from the OPV) can continue circulating through the susceptible population. - Mod.MPP ","keywordsMatched":[]},"452":{"title":"Poliomyelitis update (21): Syria (DY), Congo DR, cVDPV,\r\n\tglobal ","date":["10","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Poliomyelitis update (21): Syria (DY), Congo DR, cVDPV,\r\n\tglobal [EXTERNAL]","summary":"<br><br><strong>   Thu 10 Aug 2017 Source: Polio Eradication Initiative edited Poliovirus Weekly Update as of: 9 Aug 2017, World Health Organization -</strong><br> New wild poliovirus cases reported this week: 0 Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2017: 8 Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2016: 37 New cVDPV cases reported this week: 0 Total number of cVDPV cases in 2017: 37 Total number of cVDPV cases in 2016: 5 Headlines - The United Kingdom has announced 100 million in new funding to polio eradication to meet the final challenges. - Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: 2 positive environmental samples of wild poliovirus type 1 in Pakistan and 1 in Afghanistan; 3 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus in Syria and 3 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Details in country-specific sections below. Afghanistan - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains five. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 19 Jun 2017 from Kandahar. One new WPV1-positive environmental sample was reported in the past week, collected on 7 Jul 2017 from Lashkargah in Helmand province. - Preparations are continuing for the next round of the National Immunization Days starting on 14 Aug 2017. There is special focus on ensuring high quality vaccination drive in the southern region of the country. Pakistan - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week; the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains three. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 11 Jun 2017, from Killa Abdullah, Balochistan. - Two new WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week, the most recent collected on 19 Jul 2017, from Karachi in Sindh. - A special vaccination round is being implemented during August 2017 targeting areas with recent polio cases and positive environmental samples. These include Rawalpindi / Islamabad and demographically connected areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Quetta Block and parts of Karachi. - Under the National Emergency Action Plan for polio eradication, the country is planning to implement 2 nation-wide and 2 sub-national vaccination rounds from September to December 2017. Nigeria - No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 21 Aug 2016 in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno. - Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016). - Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance. Lake Chad Basin - The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno, Nigeria in 2016) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) (Borno and Sokoto provinces in Nigeria in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak. - Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region. Central Africa - Three new cases of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). This brings the total number of cases this year to 7, in 2 separate outbreaks of cVDPV2: in Haut Lomami province (5 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on 13 Jun 2017); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on 26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017, with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May 2017). - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time.

Middle East - In Syria, 3 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were officially confirmed at WHO headquarters in the past week, bringing the total number of cases in this outbreak to 30. Onset of paralysis of these cases is between 3 Mar 2017 and 16 Jun 2017. 29 of the cases are from Mayadeen district, Deir Ez-Zour governorate, and 1 case is from Talabyad district, Raqqa governorate. - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized and implemented, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols.

According to this weekly update from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), there are 2 active transmission sites related to cVDPVs - one in Syria and the 2nd in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). Both are areas that have had transmission identified from earlier this year (2017). In the case of Syria, it appears that the transmission of the cVDPV has been localized to the Deir al Zour governorate with a single case having been reported from the neighboring Raqqah governorate (suggesting this may have been an isolated importation). To date there have been 30 cases of polio attributable to the cVDPV in Syria. In the case of the DR Congo, while cases had been identified in 2 provinces, it appears that circulation has continued in only one of the 2 provinces - Haut Lomami province. As the dates of onset of most recent confirmed cases in both Syria and the DR Congo are in mid-June, and control vaccination campaigns were begun in mid-July (in Syria) and late June and mid July (in the 2 affected provinces in the DR Congo), and we are now in early August, it would not be surprising to learn of additional cases over the coming weeks that were infected before the immunization campaigns were completed.. Also noteworthy in the above update is the identification of 2 WPV1 positive environmental samples in Karachi, Sindh Pakistan. The most recent reported (and confirmed) case of polio due to WPV1 in Sindh was in 2016. ( ).  So the identification of the WPV1 in environmental samples is of concern as it indicates an infected individual(s) has been in the area and might be a source for continued tranmission of the WPV1.. - Mod.MPP ","keywordsMatched":[]},"456":{"title":"Hepatitis E - Africa: (Lake Chad Basin) ","date":["10","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Hepatitis E - Africa: (Lake Chad Basin) [EXTERNAL]","summary":"   Thu 10 Aug 2017 Source: Devex.com edited The hepatitis E virus has become the latest menace in West Africa's ongoing Lake Chad Basin crisis, compounding major challenges already impacting the region, including the threat of violent militant group Boko Haram, food insecurity and limited access to remote and vulnerable populations. Even more troubling, the virus seems to be circulating among displaced populations who frequently uproot and migrate, making it that much harder to contain. Following a recent visit to northeast Nigeria, Dr Philippa Easterbrook, a senior scientist for the WHO's global hepatitis program, spoke to Devex about a recently-developed WHO response plan created to reduce the number of new cases of the virus and provide training to local health workers as a means of improving case management and diagnosis. This water-borne infection was 1st reported in August 2016 in Chad's Samalat region, to the country's southeast. As of July 2017, the country had reported more than 1600 suspected or confirmed cases, and 18 deaths. The virus then surfaced in neighboring Niger in January 2017, in the Diffa region, an area near the Chad and Nigeria borders. Hepatitis E cases here spiked dramatically in mid-April 2017, and decreased before then increasing again. Now approximately 1450 people are suspected to have been infected, more than half of those women, with 38 fatalities. With the frequent movement of internally displaced populations, the infection eventually arrived in Nigeria in May 2017, in Damasak, a town near the Niger border, and has since seen 696 cases total, mostly at the Ngala internally displaced people's camp, near the Cameroon border in Borno state. Currently, all cases of hepatitis E in the Lake Chad region have been among displaced persons and refugees, Easterbrook explained. \"This led us to the working hypothesis that these outbreaks are all linked and related to large population movements,\" she said. Without immediate attention, humanitarians are concerned that the virus could spread even further within impacted countries and even into unaffected areas, such as neighboring Cameroon or the Central African Republic. Even more so, this outbreak is highlighting the unsanitary water conditions affecting those impacted by conflict in the Lake Chad Basin. Hepatitis E is most dangerous in pregnant women, and has an incubation period of 2 to 10 weeks where the infection remains asymptomatic and undetected in most people. Usually symptoms include flu-like symptoms such as: Low-grade fever, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and most notably jaundice. Because the virus carries symptoms also seen in hepatitis A, yellow fever and malaria cases, diagnosing patients and managing cases can be a challenge. Roughly 5 percent of cases develop more serious complications, according to Easterbrook, however the biggest risk is developing acute liver failure, or in pregnant women, post-partum hemorrhaging which can be fatal. The most pressing agenda in the response plan is the improvement of water and sanitation hygiene in the region. As the virus spreads via contaminated water, Easterbrook cited that the improvement of WASH conditions would not only support the reduction in new hepatitis E cases, but could also reduce the prevalence of other infectious diseases, namely hepatitis A, cholera, and typhoid. To date, roughly 200 restrooms and 100 showers have been constructed in Ngala camp. WHO has also worked with local partners to rehabilitate water points and distribute hygiene kits, which include items such as sanitary napkins and water purification tablets, to women and households. However, cultural barriers impede the progress of these initiatives. \"Some people would rather have low-level restroom facilities rather than walk some distance to a more modernized latrine,\" Easterbrook explained. Byline: Christin Roby  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. These types can cause significant outbreaks with acute hepatitis deaths, especially in 2nd and 3rd trimester pregnant women. Genotypes 3 and 4 are zoonotic, with swine being a major reservoir, and tend to be seen in the developed world. Type 3 in particular can cause chronic infection, especially in the immunocompromised host. - Mod.LL   .

Mod.JG, edited Last weekend, more than 20 children with severe respiratory symptoms were admitted to the Regional Hospital, and they were diagnosed with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. During the last week, 2 3-year-old children with severe respiratory illness were admitted to the intensive care unit, and one of them was waiting to be referred to Puerto Montt. Therefore, with information updated until last Sat 26 Aug 2017, more than 30 children with RSV infection have been reported, and all of them are hospitalized in pediatrics, pediatric intensive care, and neonatal intensive care units. Meanwhile, because of the severity of their condition  most of them being infants  7 children have been referred to hospitals in Santiago and Concepcion so they may receive adequate care, since Coyhaique Regional Hospital (CRH) does not have a pediatric intensive care unit (ICU). This is what Dr. Jaime Lopez-Quintana, Head of the CRH reported: \"This year 2017, RSV is behaving quite aggressively, and our adult intensive care unit is completely full with children. This is not an adequate condition for taking care of these children; this is not what our children in this region deserve,\" as he reported this situation to Ms. Gisela Alarcon-Rojas, Subsecretary of Healthcare Networks of the Chilean Ministry of Health, who verified the condition of children being taken care of in the (adult) ICU. So, with this complex situation, Dr. Lopez-Quintana added that specialists from important children referral centers, particularly from Dr. Luis Calvo-Mackenna and Dr. Exequiel Fernandez-Cortes hospitals, will soon arrive to this region. \"We hope to have for the next 2 weeks the support of pediatricians trained in intensive medicine who may help the team we have here in Coyhaique,\" emphasized Dr. Lopez-Quintana. According to information brought by the medical sub-direction from the Coyhaique Regional Hospital, the affected children are hospitalized in the following areas: pediatrics, neonatal intensive care unit, and (general) intensive care unit. There are 10 infants hospitalized in the pediatrics service, while another 11 children have already been discharged; so now there are 14 beds available. In the neonatal ICU, 7 children are hospitalized; 2 of them are severely ill, and the capacity of the unit is 2 beds; while in the general ICU, 6 infants are hospitalized, and there are 2 beds available. \"With respect to bed availability, the hospital is still able to cope with the situation. However, a working overload for the personnel has been observed, so that extra personnel have been recruited to cover the work shifts,\" explained Dr. Joaquin Garcia-Gay, Medical Subdirector of the CRH. Also, Dr. Garcia-Gay explained that if a child develops a febrile illness, respiratory distress, intercostal retraction and malaise for 2 days, these are some of the symptoms that may indicate the presence of RSV, which mainly affects infants less than 2 years old. \"So, if such symptoms occur, then the child must be brought to the Urgency Service. However, for those patients that develop mild respiratory symptoms, such as common cold or other similar conditions, it is preferable they are not brought to the Urgency Service, since they may be at risk for becoming infected with RSV from patients that are being hospitalized,\" the specialist advised.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Most infants are infected before one year of age, and virtually everyone gets an RSV infection by 2 years of age. Each year, on average, in the United States, RSV leads to: - 57 527 hospitalizations among children younger than 5 years old - 2.1 million outpatient visits among children younger than 5 years old - 177 000 hospitalizations and 14 000 deaths among adults older than 65 years. In the United States and other areas with similar climates, RSV infections occur primarily during fall, winter, and spring  . It is currently winter in Chile. It is not clear what may have led to this current RSV outbreak in Chile. In 2001, an outbreak of RSV struck Santiago, Chile. 150 hospital admissions were registered daily during the height of the southern hemisphere winter. It was speculated that pollution may have played a role as Santiago is one of the world's most polluted cities. Chile's geography of surrounding mountains and heat inversions in winter dramatically increases the concentration of pollutants. Pollution leads to irritation of the respiratory tract making it more difficult for the immune system to respond to infections. (Excerpted from C Orellana.

Discovery of a highly divergent coronavirus in the Asian house shrew from China illuminates the origin of the alphacoronaviruses. J Virol. 2017. pii: JVI.00764-17.<br><br><strong> abstract available at   Abstract -</strong><br> Although shrews are one of the largest groups of mammals, little is known about their role in the evolution and transmission of viral pathogens, including coronaviruses (CoVs). We captured 266 Asian house shrews (_Suncus murinus_) in Jiangxi and Zhejiang Provinces, China, during 2013 to 2015. CoV RNA was detected in 24 Asian house shrews, with an overall prevalence of 9.02 percent. Complete viral genome sequences were successfully recovered from the RNA-positive samples. The newly discovered shrew CoV fell into 4 lineages reflecting their geographic origins, indicative of largely allopatric evolution. Notably, these viruses were most closely related to alphacoronaviruses but sufficiently divergent that they should be considered a novel member of the genus _Alphacoronavirus_, which we denote Wénchéng shrew virus (WESV). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that WESV was a highly divergent member of the alphacoronaviruses and, more dramatically, that the S gene of WESV fell in a cluster that was genetically distinct from that of known coronaviruses. The divergent position of WESV suggests that coronaviruses have a long association with Asian house shrews. In addition, the genome of WESV contains a distinct NS7 gene that exhibits no sequence similarity to genes of any known viruses. Together, these data suggest that shrews are natural reservoirs for coronaviruses and may have played an important and long-term role in CoV evolution. The origin of alphacoronaviruses had been linked to bats. These data suggest that shrews might have played a role, too. - Mod.PM   .

No more reports will be submitted.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail The Chinese giant salamander (_Andrias davidianus_) is the largest amphibian in the world. It can grow to more than one meter (3.3 ft) in length. This species used to be widespread in central, south western, and southern China, but it is considered to be critically endangered. It has declined catastrophically over the last 30 years, principally due to over-exploitation, and it is now very rare, with few surviving populations known. Commercial over-exploitation for human consumption is the main threat to this species. It has also suffered from habitat destruction (such as from the construction of dams) and habitat degradation (such as water pollution from mines). For a picture go to  . In 2010, an outbreak of disease occurred amongst farmed Chinese giant salamanders in Shanxi Province, China. Clinical signs included anorexia, lethargy, ecchymosis, and swollen areas on the head and limbs and skin ulceration. An investigation was carried out and they isolated for the 1st time a ranavirus infection associated with mass mortality in Chinese giant salamanders. This virus was named Chinese giant salamander virus (CGSV-L). This virus has not been studied in the wild. It might be possible that it circulates causing little impact, but under the stressing circumstances that might arise in captivity the virulence increases. - Mod.PMB   .

A series of test has confirmed that H5 avian influenza, not the H7 bird flu strain, hit the farms in San Carlos and Sta Rita villages, of San Luis town, Pampanga. There has been no animal-to-human transmission of the disease yet, confirmed Agriculture Secretary Manny Piñol. The agriculture department began culling chickens, ducks, game fowl, and quail through carbon dioxide suffocation, in San Carlos and Sta. Rita villages, San Luis town on Sat 12 Aug 2017. A total of 400 000 birds would be culled, Piñol estimated. Policemen and agriculture authorities have also imposed checks on all exit and entry points in 12 towns in Pampanga provinces. The transport of poultry products from 5 villages in 3 towns of Pampanga such as Mexico, San Luis, Sta. Ana has been strictly prohibited. The agriculture department is also investigating the source of the disease whether it was brought by migratory birds or by ducks smuggled from China. Governor Lilia Pineda has placed the entire Pampanga province under a state of calamity following the outbreak of avian flu. This could mean P2 billion (Dh166 million) loss for the poultry sector, but poultry owners affected by the bird flu virus will be compensated, she added. Pampanga is one of the major sources of poultry products sold in Metro Manila and Central Luzon. A report on the country's bird flu outbreak will be submitted to the Paris-based World Organization for Animal Health. A poultry owner reported the deaths of at least 15 000 quail birds in San Carlos village in April and May 2017. The disease has killed a total of 37.000 fowls since April 2017. Bird flu viruses have spread in Europe and Africa in recent months. The H7N9 strain has led to transmission to human cases, including fatalities, in China.

DEFRA UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs has upgraded the threat to the UK from 'very low' to 'low'  meaning the risk is \"rare but could occur\" (EFSA European Food Safety Authority terminology). This severe disease of pigs entered Europe through Georgia in 2007, and has since continued to the Russian Federation and eastern Europe, including EU countries in the Baltic States, Poland and very recently the Czech Republic, in wild boar. In early August 2017, an outbreak was confirmed for the 1st time in Romania among backyard pigs. African swine fever is caused by infection with ASF virus (ASFV), which can have fatality rates of up to 100 per cent. The virus causes acute disease in domestic pigs and wild boar, and may cause varying clinical signs that are similar to other pig diseases such as high fever, lethargy and loss of appetite. Pigs may also die suddenly without clinical signs. Although the virus does not cause disease in humans, the impact it has on the economy, especially through trade and farming, is substantial. As a consequence of ASF in Poland and the Baltic States the value of pork and pig exports was reduced by USD 960 million (2014-2015). In Denmark, the predicted impact of an ASF outbreak is estimated at USD 12 million in direct losses and USD 349 million in exports. Unless the appropriate control measures are put in place, additional outbreaks could occur across Europe, further into Russia and beyond to Asia. An outbreak in the UK is unlikely as imports of meat and pigs are extremely well regulated and the UK does not have a wild boar population substantial enough or widespread enough to maintain an outbreak. However, personal imports of pork products from affected areas could result in disease incursion if deliberately or accidently fed to pigs or wild boar, actions which are illegal. The seriousness of an outbreak for some countries could be far worse than others; China is home to over half the world's pig population and an outbreak of ASF could result in devastating consequences. In a Veterinary Record article see reference below world-expert on ASF Dr Linda Dixon leader of the ASF group at The Pirbright Institute, outlines the factors that increase the likelihood of ASF spreading to China and highlights areas that could be improved to reduce the risk of an outbreak including biosecurity.  communicated by: ProMED-mail Subscribers may refer to more data in the article above, addressing the following questions: - how does ASF spread? - how quickly does it spread? - how can the spread of ASFV be prevented? - what is The Pirbright Institute doing to help? The last item includes the following statement: \"The vaccine research is crucial for the prevention and control of ASF, and good progress has so far been made. An effective vaccine will enable better control and prevention measures to be put in place in the future, helping stem the losses currently being suffered by farmers around the world.\" The editorial \"Preparing for the worst: African swine fever in China\", by Linda K Dixon, was recently published in the Veterinary Record  Vet Rec. 2017; 181: 115-6, doi: 10.1136/vr.j3525.  . - Mod.AS   .

Cases were reported with likely exposure in Yunnan province for the 1st time. As of 25 Jul 2017, a total of 1557 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses, including at least 605 deaths, have been reported to WHO. The number of human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses and the geographical distribution of human cases in the 5th epidemic wave (that is, onset since 1 Oct 2016) have been greater than in any earlier wave. This suggests that the virus has spread, and emphasizes that further intensive surveillance and control measures in both the human and animal health sectors are crucial. However, the number of reported confirmed cases has continued to decline over the past few weeks with only one case reported thus far with an onset of illness after 23 Jun 2017. According to reports received by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) on surveillance activities for avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses in China, positives among virological samples continue to be detected in poultry from live bird markets, commercial, and backyard farms. The agricultural authorities in China have also announced plans to commence vaccination of domestic poultry nation-wide against infection with avian influenza A(H7) viruses beginning in September 2017.<br><br><strong> Risk assessment -</strong><br> 1. What is the likelihood that additional human cases of infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses will occur? Most human cases are exposed to the A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, further human cases can be expected. Additional sporadic human cases of influenza A(H7N9) in other provinces in China that have not yet reported human cases are also expected. 2. What is the likelihood of human-to-human transmission of avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses? Even though small clusters of cases have been reported, including those involving healthcare workers, currently available epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans, thus the likelihood is low. 3. What is the risk of international spread of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus by travellers? Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.<br><br><strong> Avian influenza A(H9N2) viruses -</strong><br> Current situation: on 30 Jun 2017, one case of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) virus was reported to WHO from China in a 2-month old female child who lives in Guangdong province, China. She had onset of influenza-like illness (ILI) on 28 Apr 2017. The patient was hospitalized on 9 Jun 2017. A sample collected from the patient on 13 Jun 2017 as part of ILI surveillance was laboratory-confirmed as positive for A(H9N2) influenza virus on 16 Jun 2017. The patient was exposed to backyard poultry prior to illness. The case has fully recovered.<br><br><strong> Risk assessment -</strong><br> 1. What is the likelihood that additional human cases of infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) viruses will occur? Most human cases are exposed to the A(H9N2) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments. Human infection tends to result in mild clinical illness. Since the virus continues to be detected in poultry populations, further human cases can be expected. 2. What is the likelihood of human-to-human transmission of avian influenza A(H9N2) viruses? No case clusters have been reported. Currently available epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans, thus the likelihood is low. 3.

If this were to occur, further community level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.<br><br><strong> Overall risk management recommendations -</strong><br> - WHO does not advise special traveller screening at points of entry or restrictions with regard to the current situation of influenza viruses at the human-animal interface. For recommendations on safe trade in animals from countries affected by these influenza viruses, refer to OIE guidance. - WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal faeces. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices. - Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health. Continued vigilance is needed within affected and neighbouring areas to detect infections in animals and humans. As the extent of virus circulation in animals is not clear, epidemiological and virological surveillance and the follow-up of suspected human cases should remain high. - All human infections caused by a new influenza subtype are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005). State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this report. - It is critical that influenza viruses from animals and people are fully characterized in appropriate animal or human health influenza reference laboratories and reported according to international standards. Under WHO's Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework, Member States are expected to share their influenza viruses with pandemic potential on a regular and timely basis with the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), a WHO-coordinated network of public health laboratories. The viruses are used by the public health laboratories to assess the risk of pandemic influenza and to develop candidate vaccine viruses.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\.

According to the media, \"The Philippines will cull 200 000 chickens, quail and ducks after confirming the country's 1st outbreak of bird flu,\" Agriculture Secretary Emmanuel Pinol said on Friday 4 Aug 2017?. The avian flu outbreak was detected in a farm in San Luis municipality in Pampanga province, north of the capital Manila, which later spread to 5 neighbouring farms. There has been no case of human transmission, although health officials are conducting checks on farm workers. \"We have declared a one-km quarantine radius with the epicenter being San Luis. All fowl found within the area will be culled and buried, and the estimated population is 200 000,\" Pinol told reporters at a news conference. The volume of birds to be culled was half of Pinol's initial estimate of 400 000, which he said was based on a preliminary evaluation and was later revised after inspection. The government's report on Friday 4 Aug 2017? to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) described the flu virus in affected birds as an H5 subtype of highly pathogenic (high-path) avian influenza. Initial tests ruled out high-path H5N1 as the virus strain, Dr. Celia Carlos told reporters, and samples will be sent to Australia for further testing. \"The Department of Health is doing surveillance of possible human cases, especially concentrating on people who have been exposed to the affected animals or poultry,\" Carlos said. Culling should be completed within the next 3 days, said Pinol. The virus may have come from migratory birds from China or smuggled ducks, also from China, he said. There were indications as early as April 2017 of bird flu hitting one farm, but the situation worsened in July 2017, with around 37 000 birds dying during the period, Pinol said. The Philippines is the latest country in Asia, Europe and Africa where the bird flu viruses have spread in recent months.

That being said, there have only been 9 confirmed cases of WPV1 associated paralytic disease worldwide this year (2017), compared with 37 cases reported last year (2016). In contrast there have been 40 confirmed cases of cVDPV2 confirmed this year (2017) compared with 5 last year (2016). As a reminder, outbreaks due to cVDPV's are considered as significant in the big picture of polio eradication, as they are due to vaccine polioviruses that have reverted in neurovirulence following passage through multiple individuals while circulating in the susceptible population. The goal of the polio eradication initiative is to interrupt transmission of both the WPV's and the cVDPVs. The presence of cVDPVs occurs when there are areas with low vaccination coverage where the vaccine virus (from the OPV) can continue circulating through the susceptible population. - Mod.MPP ","keywordsMatched":[]},"48":{"title":"Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (86): Africa,\r\n\tAsia ","date":["18","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (86): Africa,\r\n\tAsia [EXTERNAL]","summary":" 4 Cholera - Pakistan (Punjab Province)  Wed 16 Aug 2017 Source: The News edited The number of cases of cholera, a highly contagious and fatal disease is continuously on the rise and there is a threat that spread of the infection may take shape of an epidemic if proper preventive and control measures are not taken well in time. The 1st 2 cases of cholera were tested positive by National Institute of Health Islamabad on Mon 31 Jul 2017 and another 2 confirmed positive for the infection on Fri 4 Aug 2017. All the 4 patients were undergoing treatment at Benazir Bhutto Hospital BH where as many as 4 more suspects of the infection have been admitted for treatment. Data collected by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017 reveals that the allied hospitals have sent stool samples of over 10 child patients to NIH for confirmation of cholera in last week week of Sun 6 Aug 2017. On Sat 12 Aug 2017, as many as 20 child patients with severe diarrhoea were admitted at the BBH of which 4 were suspected as patients of cholera and their stool samples were sent to NIH for confirmation, said Associate Professor of Paediatrics at Rawalpindi Medical University Dr Tariq Saeed when contacted by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017. He added the hospital has not received confirmation reports from the NIH because of holidays there from Saturday to Monday. However, we have been keeping the suspects in isolation under strict monitoring, he said. He added that repeated rainfalls in the region and water inundation inside and outside homes in a number of localities particularly in thickly populated areas of the city are causing contamination of water and foodstuff that increases chances of spread of a number of infections among population while children are at greater risk of contracting life-threatening infections including cholera. It is important that the transmission of cholera occurs primarily by drinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the feces (waste product) of an infected person, including one with no apparent symptoms. It is observed that heavy rainfall causes collection of heavily contaminated water in streets and houses and the waste water flooding out of various nullahs watercourses including Nullah Leh in town causes infections including cholera, typhoid, dysentery, gastroenteritis, hepatitis A and E, shigellosis and giardiasis. Professor Tariq said the consumption of contaminated water and foodstuff causes cholera, an infection in the small intestine caused by bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. Its main symptoms are watery diarrhea and vomiting that can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, and death in cases which are not treated in time, he said. Health experts say that to avoid cholera and other infections, one must use boiled water for drinking and should use vegetables after washing with clean water and it must be kept in mind that raw vegetables should not be eaten in the existing weather conditions instead these should be used after cooking. To a query, Professor Tariq said the heavy rainfall and water accumulation may contaminate water at sources and there may be chances of contamination of water at tube wells so individuals must boil water before drinking to avoid cholera and other infections. He added the appearance of cholera is alarming and it is time for people to take extra ordinary preventive measures to safeguard their children and themselves from the disease. In case water is accumulated inside home due to heavy rainfall and flooded out of sewage lines, it must be wiped out immediately and the space should be washed with clean water as soon as possible to avoid infections. Avoiding inundation of contaminated water inside homes is a must to avoid cholera and other infections, said Professor Tariq.

According to this weekly update from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), there are 2 active transmission sites related to cVDPVs - one in Syria and the 2nd in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). Both are areas that have had transmission identified from earlier this year (2017). In the case of Syria, it appears that the transmission of the cVDPV has been localized to the Deir al Zour governorate with a single case having been reported from the neighboring Raqqah governorate (suggesting this may have been an isolated importation). To date there have been 30 cases of polio attributable to the cVDPV in Syria. In the case of the DR Congo, while cases had been identified in 2 provinces, it appears that circulation has continued in only one of the 2 provinces - Haut Lomami province. As the dates of onset of most recent confirmed cases in both Syria and the DR Congo are in mid-June, and control vaccination campaigns were begun in mid-July (in Syria) and late June and mid July (in the 2 affected provinces in the DR Congo), and we are now in early August, it would not be surprising to learn of additional cases over the coming weeks that were infected before the immunization campaigns were completed.. Also noteworthy in the above update is the identification of 2 WPV1 positive environmental samples in Karachi, Sindh Pakistan. The most recent reported (and confirmed) case of polio due to WPV1 in Sindh was in 2016. ( ).  So the identification of the WPV1 in environmental samples is of concern as it indicates an infected individual(s) has been in the area and might be a source for continued tranmission of the WPV1.. - Mod.MPP ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Republic of Congo":{"33":{"title":"Poliomyelitis update (22): Syria, Afghanistan, Somalia,\r\n\tglobal ","date":["16","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Poliomyelitis update (22): Syria, Afghanistan, Somalia,\r\n\tglobal [EXTERNAL]","summary":"<br><br><strong> 3 Global: Global Polio Eradication Initiative, Syria, Afghanistan  Wed 16 Aug 2017 Source: Global Polio Eradication Initiative edited Poliovirus weekly update  as of 16-Aug-2017 - New wild poliovirus cases reported this week: 1 Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2017: 9 Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2016: 37 New cVDPV cases reported this week: 3 Total number of cVDPV cases in 2017: 40 Total number of cVDPV cases in 2016: 5 Headlines -</strong><br> - Marking Pakistan's Independence Day 14 August this week, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau paid tribute to both countries' ongoing collaboration, including on the effort to eradicate polio.\" Our 2 countries established a diplomatic relationship shortly after Pakistan was declared a sovereign nation in 1947.

That being said, there have only been 9 confirmed cases of WPV1 associated paralytic disease worldwide this year (2017), compared with 37 cases reported last year (2016). In contrast there have been 40 confirmed cases of cVDPV2 confirmed this year (2017) compared with 5 last year (2016). As a reminder, outbreaks due to cVDPV's are considered as significant in the big picture of polio eradication, as they are due to vaccine polioviruses that have reverted in neurovirulence following passage through multiple individuals while circulating in the susceptible population. The goal of the polio eradication initiative is to interrupt transmission of both the WPV's and the cVDPVs. The presence of cVDPVs occurs when there are areas with low vaccination coverage where the vaccine virus (from the OPV) can continue circulating through the susceptible population. - Mod.MPP ","keywordsMatched":[]},"48":{"title":"Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (86): Africa,\r\n\tAsia ","date":["18","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (86): Africa,\r\n\tAsia [EXTERNAL]","summary":" 4 Cholera - Pakistan (Punjab Province)  Wed 16 Aug 2017 Source: The News edited The number of cases of cholera, a highly contagious and fatal disease is continuously on the rise and there is a threat that spread of the infection may take shape of an epidemic if proper preventive and control measures are not taken well in time. The 1st 2 cases of cholera were tested positive by National Institute of Health Islamabad on Mon 31 Jul 2017 and another 2 confirmed positive for the infection on Fri 4 Aug 2017. All the 4 patients were undergoing treatment at Benazir Bhutto Hospital BH where as many as 4 more suspects of the infection have been admitted for treatment. Data collected by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017 reveals that the allied hospitals have sent stool samples of over 10 child patients to NIH for confirmation of cholera in last week week of Sun 6 Aug 2017. On Sat 12 Aug 2017, as many as 20 child patients with severe diarrhoea were admitted at the BBH of which 4 were suspected as patients of cholera and their stool samples were sent to NIH for confirmation, said Associate Professor of Paediatrics at Rawalpindi Medical University Dr Tariq Saeed when contacted by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017. He added the hospital has not received confirmation reports from the NIH because of holidays there from Saturday to Monday. However, we have been keeping the suspects in isolation under strict monitoring, he said. He added that repeated rainfalls in the region and water inundation inside and outside homes in a number of localities particularly in thickly populated areas of the city are causing contamination of water and foodstuff that increases chances of spread of a number of infections among population while children are at greater risk of contracting life-threatening infections including cholera. It is important that the transmission of cholera occurs primarily by drinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the feces (waste product) of an infected person, including one with no apparent symptoms. It is observed that heavy rainfall causes collection of heavily contaminated water in streets and houses and the waste water flooding out of various nullahs watercourses including Nullah Leh in town causes infections including cholera, typhoid, dysentery, gastroenteritis, hepatitis A and E, shigellosis and giardiasis. Professor Tariq said the consumption of contaminated water and foodstuff causes cholera, an infection in the small intestine caused by bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. Its main symptoms are watery diarrhea and vomiting that can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, and death in cases which are not treated in time, he said. Health experts say that to avoid cholera and other infections, one must use boiled water for drinking and should use vegetables after washing with clean water and it must be kept in mind that raw vegetables should not be eaten in the existing weather conditions instead these should be used after cooking. To a query, Professor Tariq said the heavy rainfall and water accumulation may contaminate water at sources and there may be chances of contamination of water at tube wells so individuals must boil water before drinking to avoid cholera and other infections. He added the appearance of cholera is alarming and it is time for people to take extra ordinary preventive measures to safeguard their children and themselves from the disease. In case water is accumulated inside home due to heavy rainfall and flooded out of sewage lines, it must be wiped out immediately and the space should be washed with clean water as soon as possible to avoid infections. Avoiding inundation of contaminated water inside homes is a must to avoid cholera and other infections, said Professor Tariq.

According to this weekly update from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), there are 2 active transmission sites related to cVDPVs - one in Syria and the 2nd in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). Both are areas that have had transmission identified from earlier this year (2017). In the case of Syria, it appears that the transmission of the cVDPV has been localized to the Deir al Zour governorate with a single case having been reported from the neighboring Raqqah governorate (suggesting this may have been an isolated importation). To date there have been 30 cases of polio attributable to the cVDPV in Syria. In the case of the DR Congo, while cases had been identified in 2 provinces, it appears that circulation has continued in only one of the 2 provinces - Haut Lomami province. As the dates of onset of most recent confirmed cases in both Syria and the DR Congo are in mid-June, and control vaccination campaigns were begun in mid-July (in Syria) and late June and mid July (in the 2 affected provinces in the DR Congo), and we are now in early August, it would not be surprising to learn of additional cases over the coming weeks that were infected before the immunization campaigns were completed.. Also noteworthy in the above update is the identification of 2 WPV1 positive environmental samples in Karachi, Sindh Pakistan. The most recent reported (and confirmed) case of polio due to WPV1 in Sindh was in 2016. ( ).  So the identification of the WPV1 in environmental samples is of concern as it indicates an infected individual(s) has been in the area and might be a source for continued tranmission of the WPV1.. - Mod.MPP ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Costa Rica":{"62":{"title":"Zika virus (16): Americas, Asia, research,\r\n\tobservations ","date":["17","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Zika virus (16): Americas, Asia, research,\r\n\tobservations [EXTERNAL]","summary":" 11 _Culex quinquefasciatus_ as vectors  Wed 9 Aug 2017 Source: Emerging Microbes & Infections edited ref: Guedes DR, Paiva MH, Donato MM, et al.

Emerg Microbes Infect. 2017; 6(8): e69. doi: 10.1038/emi.2017.<br><br><strong>59  Abstract </strong><br> Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has recently been associated with an increased incidence of neonatal microcephaly and other neurological disorders. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito bite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some cases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main vector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other mosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the virus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit ZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of laboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. Interestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the midgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in Recife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially fed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx. quinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced. Collectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range of ZIKV vectors than anticipated.  <br><br>Communicated by: Roland Hübner Superior Health Council Brussels Belgium Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active virus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their ability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step toward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_ fed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in saliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing. The study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a competent vector. Several other studies have shown this species to be inefficient vectors or refractory to Zika virus infection. One wonders if the specific _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ used or the Zika virus isolates with which they were tested could account for these very different results. Resolving these discrepancies is important because this mosquito species is very widely distributed around the world and bears directly on risk of outbreaks in geographic areas where _Aedes aegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_ , Zika virus vectors, do not occur. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"91":{"title":"Chikungunya (27) - Americas, Europe, Asia ","date":["18","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Chikungunya (27) - Americas, Europe, Asia [EXTERNAL]","summary":"<br><br><strong> Cases in various countries: Regional summaries - Americas -</strong><br> WHO/PAHO report 18 Aug 2017 Reported cases of chikungunya fever in the Americas, by country or territory - 2017 to EW 33 week ending 18 Aug 2017.

Given the outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections in the region, and the clinical similarity of cases of that virus infection and CHIKV infection, one wonders how many cases that were not laboratory confirmed but clinically diagnosed as ZIKV infections were, in reality, CHIKV infections. It is also possible that a significant proportion of the population have been infected by CHIKV in the previous 3 years and are now immune. It seems likely, however, that CHIKV is now endemic in the Americas, and sporadic, small outbreaks may continue to occur as they do in Asia and Africa. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"165":{"title":["Zika Virus in Costa Rica"],"date":["08","August","2017"],"url":"wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/alert/zika-virus-costa-rica","summary":"Mosquitoes that can spread Zika usually live in places below 6,500 feet.

BoNTs prevent neurotransmitter release and lead to a flaccid paralysis. There are 3 main forms of human botulism: food-borne, wound and infant botulism 1,2. The BoNTs are produced by 6 phylogenetically and physiologically distinct bacteria (_Clostridium botulinum_ Groups I-IV, and strains of _C. baratii_ and _C. butyricum_) which are so diverse as to merit classification as different species. All of the BoNT-producing _Clostridium_ species have non BoNT-producing counterparts (not harboring the BoNT gene cluster) which are often assigned to different species names, such as _C. sporogenes_ for _C. botulinum_ Group I strains 2. This polyphyly of _C. botulinum_ together with its close relationship to non-toxigenic species can result either in the erroneous detection of toxigenic _Clostridium_ species or failure thereof. The BoNT gene cluster is often associated with mobile genetic elements, allowing for interconversion between toxigenic and nontoxigenic _Clostridium_ species, and leading to substantial variation in BoNT sequences and their genomic backgrounds 3. Today, the BoNT serotypes are divided into more than 40 subtypes, including BoNT/A1 to BoNT/A8 4, and mosaic forms 5. The BoNT diversity at the amino acid level can reach up to 36 percent within a serotype and is reflected by differences in their catalytic activity, receptor binding or pharmacokinetics 6. In addition to containing the gene for BoNT, the BoNT gene cluster contains the gene for the non-toxic non-haemagglutinin (NTNH) protein. The BoNT gene cluster also harbors either 3 hemagglutinin (HA) genes (ha1, ha2 and ha3) in the HA cluster or 3 orfX genes (orfX1, orfX2 and orfX3) in the orfX cluster. Together with BoNT, these accessory proteins can form complexes of varying size and composition 7. The variability observed in BoNTs due to the existence of 7 serotypes, mosaic forms, several different subtypes and the occurrence of BoNT in different complexes, as well as their heterogeneous genetic background are probably the main reasons for the spectrum of clinical presentations and disease duration associated with botulism, and pose a tremendous challenge to diagnostic laboratories 8. Botulism is associated with a wide variety of foods that are rich in protein and kept under the partial exclusion of oxygen, or in an environment where oxygen has been depleted by other bacteria. Marinated meat, fish, fruits, vegetables or mushrooms as well as home-canned products and home-cured or smoked meat or fish products, which are consumed unheated, are particularly known sources. BoNTs are heat-labile and can be destroyed by temperatures above 70 C 158 F in minutes 9,10. Nowadays, foodborne botulism is almost exclusively associated with home-produced foods, but commercial food products are occasionally involved in single cases or small outbreaks 11-13. Between 2010-2014, ECDC reported 492 cases in Europe 14, with the last case occurring in Slovakia in 2012 15.<br><br><strong> The event -</strong><br> In mid-August 2015 (day 0), an otherwise healthy adult in their 40s consumed, for dinner, 3 packs (100 g each) 3.52 ounces of a commercial hummus spread. The hummus, which was sold in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, had a best-before date of 9 days after consumption. The following morning (day 1), 9-11 hours after consumption of the hummus, the patient experienced nausea, vomiting, double vision, unsteady gait, dizziness, generalized weakness and difficulties swallowing, and was admitted to hospital. Despite receiving 3 doses of equine trivalent anti-A, B and E antitoxin, the patient felt into a coma on day 2 and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). As botulism is a mandatory notifiable disease in Slovakia, the clinic reported the suspected botulism case to local health authorities. A gastric lavage, but neither serum nor stool, was taken on day 2 and stored at 4 C 39.2 F for further analysis. After one week of storage, the gastric lavage was sent to the Public Health Institute in Ostrava, Czech Republic where it tested negative by mouse bioassay. Treatment consisted mainly of intensive symptomatic care and respiratory support for almost 50 days. The patient was discharged from hospital after 78 days, but still complained about breathing problems as of their last follow-up in May 2017.<br><br><strong> Methods: Epidemiological investigation -</strong><br> On day one, after being notified by the clinic, the regional health authorities started an epidemiological investigation by interviewing the hospitalized patient. The next day, day 2, the patient's household was inspected to check for additional cases and to collect food samples. There, a close relative who shares the same household was interviewed, a list of food items consumed by the patient over the last days was recorded and suspicious food items were collected. In cooperation with the Slovak State Veterinary and Food Administration (SVPS), an investigation on the composition and the origin of the ingredients used for production of the hummus was conducted at the food processing facility.<br><br><strong> Laboratory investigation </strong><br> Isolation of _Clostridium botulinum_ from hummus and molecular analysis. Small particles of hummus left on the packaging of the 3 nearly empty hummus tubes were streaked on tryptic soy agar and Schaedler agar plates, and subjected to anaerobic culture at 37 C 98.6 F in anaerobic jars following EN ISO 7937:2005. Almost all colonies showed typical clostridia-like morphology and were probed for the presence of bont genes with a multiplex PCR for bont/A, bont/B, bont/E and bont/F 16 according to CEN ISO/TS 17919:2013. Genetic analysis Isolates were transferred to the Consultant laboratory for neurotoxin-producing clostridia (botulism, tetanus), formerly called the Consultant Laboratory for _Clostridium botulinum_, at the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) in Berlin, Germany for further molecular biological investigation. Isolates were grown in tryptone-peptone-glucose-yeast extract (TPGY) medium at 32 C 89.6 F in an anaerobic workstation (MG500, Don Whitley, Shipley, United Kingdom), and tested for the presence of bont/A-G by single and multiplex quantitative PCR 17. In addition, a quantitative PCR was used to test for the ntnh gene as a surrogate marker for BoNT-producing _Clostridium spp._ 18. To further investigate the composition of the BoNT gene cluster, a set of 6 conventional PCRs targeting the 3 ha genes and the 3 orfX genes was applied 19. Toxin production in supernatants was confirmed by in-house ELISA tests as described 20,21. The 16S rRNA and bont/A gene sequences were obtained by Sanger sequencing 22. Sequences were assembled and compared with the GenBank database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information in the United States via Geneious software packages (Biomatters Limited, Auckland, New Zealand) using the BLAST algorithm 23. For subtyping, the amino acid sequence of the BoNT was compared with the 8 known BoNT/A subtypes 4. Sequences of the other BoNT/A subtypes were uploaded into Geneious and pairwise identities of the aligned sequences were calculated using the MAFFT algorithm 24. For comparison, the BoNT subtypes of the following BoNT strains causing food-borne botulism in the past (except for BoNT/A4 which originated from an infant botulism case) were selected (GenBank accession numbers in parenthesis): BoNT/A1 (HA cluster) strain ATCC3502 (AM412317); BoNT/A1 (orfX cluster) strain NCTC2916 (X52066); BoNT/A2 (orfX cluster) strain Mascarpone (DQ310546); BoNT/A3 (orfX cluster) strain Loch Maree (CP000963); BoNT/A4 (orfX cluster) strain 657 (EU341307); BoNT/A5 (HA cluster) strain 1430.11 (KC683799); BoNT/A6 (orfX cluster) strain CDC41370 (FJ981696); BoNT/A7 (unknown cluster) strain 2008-148 (JQ954969); BoNT/A8 (orfX cluster) strain Chemnitz (KM233166). Further microbiological investigation In order to identify additional possibly contaminated products of the same production date, the Regional Authority of Public Health (RAPH) in Banska Bystrica investigated the products' availability at several local supermarkets and the food bank. While no additional hummus was available from the food bank, 3 tubes of hummus with the same production date as the ones consumed were obtained from a supermarket. Unopened products were stored at 37 C 98.6 F for several days to reach suitable conditions for _C. botulinum_/_C. sporogenes_ germination and growth.<br><br><strong> Results -</strong><br> Epidemiological investigation: Results from the interview revealed that on day 0, the patient alone ate scrambled eggs for breakfast; the patient, a close relative and a friend shared the same meal of mushrooms in cream sauce with pasta for lunch; and the patient alone ate the hummus at dinner after obtaining it from a food bank. The interview of the patient and a close relative revealed that one tube of the hummus product showed gas production prior to being opened, but it tasted normal according to the patient. The epidemiologists notified the Regional Veterinary and Food Administration of the Slovak Republic and the 3 nearly empty tubes of hummus and 2 unopened packs of a commercial ready-to-eat sauerkraut and vegetarian sausage meal, from the same company as the hummus, were sent for laboratory investigation. Neither the scrambled eggs nor the pasta dish were available for sampling. An investigation at the producing company revealed that the hummus product consisted of the following ingredients: chick peas, tofu, rapeseed oil, onion, salt, maize starch and spices. It also revealed that the chick peas originated from Brazil or Argentina. Laboratory investigation: RAPH received the collected food items, including the 3 opened and nearly empty 100 g 3.52 ounces hummus tubes. Three strains with typical _C. botulinum_ morphology (designated Banska Bystrica, RAPH1223j and RAPH1224) were isolated, one from each tube. Two of them, Banska Bystrica and RAPH1223j, were PCR-positive for the bont/A gene. The vegetarian sausage and sauerkraut meal tested negative for the presence of _C. botulinum_ and the bont/A gene. On day 7, as soon as the 1st results were available, the hummus was withdrawn from the market and a Food and Feed Safety Alert was issued through the European Commission's Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF). The 3 unopened hummus tubes with the same production date that were obtained from a supermarket were subjected to 37 C 98.6 F storage. Microbiological analysis and PCR testing did not reveal the presence of _C. botulinum_ or _C. sporogenes_ despite some signs of gas formation during storage. Molecular biological characterisation of isolated strains: The sequences of the 16S rRNA gene analysed at RKI revealed that all 3 isolates (strains Banska Bystrica, RAPH1223j and RAPH1224) belonged to _C. botulinum_ Group I/_C. sporogenes_ (greater than 99 percent identity), which are almost indistinguishable at the 16S rRNA sequence level 2,25. The presence of bont/A and ntnh genes was confirmed by quantitative PCR, and expression of the toxin was shown by an in-house ELISA for isolates Banska Bystrica and RAPH1223j. From the 2 BoNT/A-positive isolates, the BoNT/A sequences were obtained and compared with GenBank entries at the nucleotide (nt) and the amino acid level. Both toxigenic isolates (Banska Bystrica and RAPH1223j) were found to harbor a bont/A gene of identical sequence; the bont/A sequence of one strain, Banska Bystrica, was submitted to GenBank under accession number KU376389. It showed the highest identity (greater than or equal to 99.6 percent) to bont/A sequences of the unusual subtype BoNT/A3. Table one shows the distances computed against all BoNT/A subtypes at the nt and the amino acid levels for Table, see original URL - Mod.LL. Compared with the prototype BoNT/A1, the BoNT of the new BoNT/A-positive isolates, Banska Bystrica and RAPH1223j, had an identity at the amino acid level of only 84.6 percent (compared with BoNT/A1 strain ATCC3502; HA cluster) or 84.5 percent (compared with BoNT/A1 strain NCTC2916; orfX cluster). Similar low amino acid level identities (between 84.3 percent and 87.7 percent) were found when compared with BoNT subtypes A4-A8, whereas amino acid level identity with subtype A2 (strain Mascarpone) was 92.9 percent. Sequence identities at the nt level were generally higher, but still diverged by up to 8.5 percent. Both isolates (Banska Bystrica and RAPH1223j) were negative for the ha1, ha2 and ha3 genes and positive for the orfX1, orfX2 and orfX3 genes by PCR; this is in agreement with the BoNT/A3 strain Loch Maree in which the bont/A gene is located in the orfX cluster.<br><br><strong> Discussion </strong><br> Our laboratory investigations support the diagnosis of a case of foodborne botulism caused by the unusual BoNT subtype A3 in food consumed by the patient. To our knowledge, this is only the 2nd time that this subtype was involved in foodborne botulism since 8 people died from contaminated wild duck paste in Loch Maree, Scotland in 1922 26. No other strain belonging to this specific A3 subtype was isolated or subtyped for nearly a century until Luquez and colleagues identified 3 strains from Argentina (in soil and salad) in 2012 27. Interestingly, the 2 described BoNT/A-positive isolates have an identical BoNT/A sequence at the amino acid level as one of the strains (CDC54054) isolated from Argentinian soil 27, and the chick peas used in the hummus consumed by the patient originated from South America, either from Brazil or Argentina. Initially, suspected botulism could not be confirmed by testing the gastric lavage taken on day 2. Considering the acidity and proteolytic activity, as well as the length of storage, the gastric lavage taken after emesis on day one was not an ideal sample. Serum and stool samples, which have been proposed to be the most reliable samples for diagnostic testing 28, might not have been collected, because of a lack of testing facilities and inexperienced clinical personnel, particularly since botulism is a rare disease and no cases have been notified in Slovakia since 2012 15. For the clinician, it is important to consider the optimal timing when choosing samples for botulism diagnosis. Despite demonstration of BoNT in serum as one of the key tests to confirm botulism, the time period in which BoNT can be detected from serum is usually limited to the 1st few days after oral ingestion. However, confirmation of BoNT-producing _Clostridium_ species (spores) from feces can often be achieved over a more prolonged period (up to two weeks) 28,29. Therefore, co-examination of serum and stool is recommended to confirm clinical cases of food-borne botulism 28-31. The mere detection of _C. botulinum_ from feces without clinical symptoms does not imply the presence of botulism given that _C. botulinum spores_ are not usually detected in the feces of healthy humans. However, on rare occasions, spores that have been ingested with naturally contaminated food (e.g. honey, fresh vegetables) might be detected in the feces of otherwise healthy people 28. In our case, foodborne botulism could only be confirmed by the isolation of _C. botulinum_ from 2 of the 3 consumed tubes of hummus. It is always hard to exclude that the analyzed food become cross-contaminated in the household with _C. botulinum_ by handling with kitchen utensils contaminated via another food. However, there was no indication that the hummus became cross-contaminated within the patient's household. In the aftermath of the current botulism case, 3 unopened hummus tubes with the same production date were subjected to 37 C 98.6 F storage and analyzed for the presence of _C. botulinum_ without any positive result. It is not unusual that _C. botulinum_ cannot be detected from other items of the same lot. In 3 botulism outbreaks in Europe in 2011, which involved commercial olive tapenade, almond-stuffed olives and korma sauce, _C. botulinum_ and BoNT could only be identified from one or 2 opened jars/pots obtained from the households, but not from any unopened jars/pots from the same lot (consisting of 60, 900, and 1836 items, respectively) that were tested 11,32-34. These cases indicate that even in modern industrialized food production, contamination of a single or a very few items within a lot cannot be completely excluded. In all those cases, consumer protection had utmost priority and food recalls were issued solely on the basis of positive results from the remaining product in the open containers from the affected households to prevent a potential spread of the disease 32-34. Hummus has been involved in a foodborne botulism outbreak in the past, possibly due to incorrect storage temperature 35 C 95 F. Whether this was the case in the event presented here could not be determined, but the patient did notice gas formation in the products. This might be indicative of spoilage as growth of _C. botulinum_ in spoiled products is often associated with gas production, e.g. foaming, bulging of cans 36. However, unlike Group II strains of _C. botulinum_ which can grow at refrigeration temperatures, Group I strains (to which this study's isolated strains belong) require growth temperatures above 10 C 50 F 2. This suggests that the hummus product was at least partially stored above refrigeration temperatures. Compared with the known 8 BoNT/A subtypes (BoNT/A1 to BoNT/A8 4), the subtype A3 is both very rare and the most distant from the prototype BoNT/A1 (Table 1), being up to 15.4 percent and 8 percent different at the amino acid and nt level, respectively. Notably, because of its amino acid sequence divergence, BoNT/A3 is known to be neutralized less efficiently by polyclonal antibodies generated against BoNT/A1 37. This has led us to speculate that the long lasting neurological effects observed in the patient despite the administration of 3 doses of trivalent antitoxin might at least be partially due to suboptimal neutralization by the antitoxin, which is directed against BoNT/A1. The rareness and divergence of the BoNT/A3 subtype poses the risk that it might not be detected by immunological or sequence-based diagnostic assays that have not been validated against it. In fact, one ELISA has already been shown to be unable to detect it 38. Furthermore, in one 39 of the 4 mentioned PCR methods in ISO ISO/TS 17919:2013, the sequence of one primer and the probe each contain one mismatch towards all BoNT/A3 sequences. These mismatches might therefore hamper identification of strains belonging to the A3 subtype by the corresponding PCR 40,41. Testing laboratories should be aware that strains harboring this rare subtype can occur in European countries and are advised to validate their methods accordingly. Unfortunately, the exchange of BoNT-producing strains and in some instances, even the sharing of their sequence information are restricted because of their nature as possible biowarfare agents and other dual-use concerns 42,43.<br><br><strong> Conclusion </strong><br> Rare and novel BoNT sequence variation can especially easily escape detection by sequence-based or immunological methods. As more sequences become available despite some restrictions, diagnostic facilities should check their PCRs frequently to ensure inclusion of all known sequence variations. As a result of the rareness of botulism, many laboratories have no or only individual assays for detection at hand. Specialized laboratories (e.g. national reference laboratories or consultant laboratories) able to apply a broader range of methods could aid those laboratories, but are often not easily identifiable by the laboratories responsible for testing the samples.

Ministers and food safety chiefs from around the European Union are set to meet on Tue 6 Sep 2017 in a bid to get countries to stop \"blaming and shaming\" each other over the scare involving the chemical fipronil. Millions of eggs have been pulled from supermarket shelves across Europe and dozens of poultry farms closed since the discovery of fipronil, which can harm human health, was made public on 1 Aug 2017. The issue has sparked a row between Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, the 3 countries at the epicentre of the crisis, about how long they knew about the problem. \"Blaming and shaming will bring us nowhere and I want to stop this,\" Vytenis Andriukaitis, the European Commissioner for health and food safety, told AFP as he announced the meeting. \"We need to work together to draw the necessary lessons and move forward instead.\" European Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said that \"this is not, let's be clear, a crisis meeting\" and it is being held next month September 2017 to get \"distance to the events\". Fipronil is commonly used to get rid of fleas, lice and ticks from animals but is banned by the European Union from use in the food industry. The EU insists there is no threat to human health, but the World Health Organization (WHO) says that when eaten in large quantities it can harm people's kidneys, liver and thyroid glands. Brussels said the 15 affected EU countries were Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Sweden, Britain, Austria, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Denmark, along with non-EU Switzerland. But in a sign the crisis is going global, Brussels also announced that Hong Kong had received some tainted eggs from the Netherlands, with the southern Chinese city becoming the 1st place in Asia known to be affected. As well as dealing with the immediate food safety issue, the EU is also seeking to calm tempers over the egg row after a series of divisive crises in the bloc in recent years, from Brexit to migration. Belgium earlier this week week of Mon 6 Aug 2017 accused the Netherlands of knowing about the fipronil eggs since November 2016 and failing to notify other countries. On Thu 10 Aug 2017 Dutch Health Minister Edith Schippers admitted the government had made \"errors\" but denied a cover-up. \"We were well aware of a report of the presence of fipronil in the pens of egg-laying hens in November 2016, but there was no indication at the time that fipronil itself was found in the eggs,\" said Schippers. A Dutch whistleblower separately said he had told the authorities that Chickfriend, the Dutch company at the centre of the scandal, was illegally using fipronil in the treatment of lice in chicken pens in The Netherlands. \"I am the anonymous whistleblower,\" Nick Hermens told the NPO public broadcaster. A Belgian company, Poultry Vision, has said it provided Chickfriend with the chemical. Dutch and Belgian investigators carried out coordinated raids on several premises on Thu 10 Aug 2017, arresting 2 people at Chickfriend. However, Belgium itself has been forced to admit that it knew about fipronil in eggs back in June 2017 but kept it secret for nearly 2 months because of a criminal investigation. Fresh discoveries of contaminated eggs have continued daily. Denmark said on Fri 11 Aug 2017 it had found 2 tonnes of fipronil-tainted scrambled eggs, bringing the total of contaminated eggs to 22 tonnes, mainly from Belgium. Poland said it had discovered about 40 000 eggs imported from Germany. French Agriculture Minister Stephane Travert said that since April 2017 the country had sold nearly 250 000 contaminated eggs, imported from Belgium and the Netherlands, but the risk for consumers was \"very low\" given French eating habits. The food scare is one of the biggest to hit Europe since the 2013 horsemeat scandal when equine meat was falsely labelled and mis-sold. Previous food scandals include contamination of chickens and eggs by dioxin in 1999, which began in Belgium, and mad-cow disease via cattle feed contaminated by the ground-up carcasses of animals infected with a deadly brain disorder - which ran from roughly 1986 to 1998 and started in Britain.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\.

Emerg Microbes Infect. 2017; 6(8): e69. doi: 10.1038/emi.2017.<br><br><strong>59  Abstract </strong><br> Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has recently been associated with an increased incidence of neonatal microcephaly and other neurological disorders. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito bite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some cases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main vector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other mosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the virus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit ZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of laboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. Interestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the midgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in Recife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially fed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx. quinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced. Collectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range of ZIKV vectors than anticipated.  <br><br>Communicated by: Roland Hübner Superior Health Council Brussels Belgium Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active virus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their ability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step toward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_ fed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in saliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing. The study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a competent vector. Several other studies have shown this species to be inefficient vectors or refractory to Zika virus infection. One wonders if the specific _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ used or the Zika virus isolates with which they were tested could account for these very different results. Resolving these discrepancies is important because this mosquito species is very widely distributed around the world and bears directly on risk of outbreaks in geographic areas where _Aedes aegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_ , Zika virus vectors, do not occur. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"135":{"title":["Zika Virus in El Salvador "],"date":["08","August","2017"],"url":"wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/alert/zika-virus-el-salvador","summary":"Mosquitoes that can spread Zika usually live in places below 6,500 feet.

Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world. A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries. Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years. \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\" \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea\". The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years 2 million DALYs since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln 13 million DALYs in the US, and 36-mln 36 million DALYs in Ethiopia. \"Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,\" continues Prof Melegaro \"our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population. Tailoring immunization campaigns to achieve measles eradication goals is essential and currently, for some countries, this means considering also the role of unprotected adolescents and young adults.

Measles vaccination coverage is suboptimal in Italy (ranging between 85.4 percent and 90.6 percent for one dose during the period 2007-2016) 1, which has led to large pockets of susceptible adults. We describe an outbreak in an Italian hospital between February and April 2017 among healthcare workers (HCW), hospital support personnel (hospital workers in activities not involving direct contact with patients), hospital visitors and community contacts. This outbreak was part of a wider epidemic in Italy that started in January 2017 and has, as at Sun 30 Jul 2017, led to 4001 cases nationwide (275 in HCW) 2.<br><br><strong> Outbreak description </strong><br> A HCW was referred to the emergency department (ED) of an Italian hospital for a rash developed after taking antibacterials for a mild cough and coryza. The rash was considered an allergic reaction to the antibacterial and the HCW was admitted to the hospital inpatient clinic. Three days later, the HCW's child was admitted to hospital for a rash diagnosed as due to a non-communicable systemic disease. Subsequent serology showed that both the HCW and the child had measles. The origin of the infection for the index case is still unknown. It should be noted, however, that at least 10 community cases of measles occurred in the same period in the area of residence of the HCW. Using the standard case definition of the European Commission 3, a total of 34 measles cases during the following weeks were identified by tracing the contacts of the index case. Among them, 15 were HCWs, 5 were support personnel, 4 were hospital visitors and 11 were community contacts of the above cases. The secondary cases to the index (n = 8) occurred in 2 of the HCW's relatives, in 4 other HCWs, and in 2 support workers who were not immediately recognized as belonging to the hospital outbreak. One of the secondary cases, a HCW, was in service until the onset of symptoms, accessing all rooms on 2 inpatient wards. Tertiary cases (n = 6) involved the family of this HCW, 3 HCWs and a member of support personnel. A total of 2 weeks after the admission of the index case, 2 of the HCWs belonging to tertiary cases presented during the night to the ED where they stayed for nearly 10 hours. An additional 15 cases could be traced following this single exposure window, namely 7 HCWs, 2 support workers, 3 relatives of theirs and 3 visitors to the ED during the time the 2 HCWs were present. One more community case was related to contact outside hospital with one of the tertiary HCW cases. Additional cases were related to a visitor at one of the involved inpatient wards, who probably got in contact with one of the tertiary cases who were HCW during the incubation period and generated 3 cases in the community, among them a family pediatrician. Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the epidemic curve and the outbreak tree for figures, see original URL - Mod.LL.<br><br><strong> Characteristics of cases </strong><br> Up to 6 cases occurred in children up to 9 years of age, while 2 occurred in adolescents between 10 and 17 years and the majority of cases (n = 27) in adults 18 years and older. Figure 3 describes the age distribution among different categories of cases. Vaccination status was known for 24 cases. Sixteen were unvaccinated (2 children, 14 adults), 2 had received one dose, one a full course of 2 doses, and 5 cases occurred in contacts who received one dose of post-exposure vaccination. Of the 5 contacts who received post exposure vaccine, one was an infant younger than one year for whom information about the date of vaccination is not available; for the other 4, the delay between presumed contact date and immunization was 3 days in 2 cases, 6 and 12 days for the remaining 2 cases. Among the HCWs, 2 were vaccinated, 11 were unvaccinated and for 2 of them the data was unavailable. Among the 5 cases belonging to support personnel 2 were unvaccinated and the status was unknown for the remaining 3. Genotyping was available for 3 cases: genotype B3, subtype 3.1 was found in all of them.<br><br><strong> Conclusion and recommendations -</strong><br> Measles elimination in Europe, despite the immunization efforts, is still jeopardized by recurrent outbreaks in susceptible populations 4-7. Nosocomial transmission of measles is an important and emerging way of spreading the infection 8-11. Anyone staying in the hospital environment, regardless of role, can be affected because measles is highly contagious and persists in the environment for up to 2 hours, thus requiring appropriate and timely infection control measures 12,13. Considering that transmission may occur 3 days before the onset of rash, early diagnosis when only non-specific preliminary symptoms (cough, coryza and conjunctivitis) are present is crucial for containing the outbreak 14. A single exposure window, that occurred 2 weeks after the admission of the index case, when 2 cases were present in the ED, resulted in further 15 cases. Appropriate procedures are needed for patients with suspect transmissible infection in the ED, an issue not limited to measles but shared with several other highly infective conditions 13. A 2-dose vaccination is the most effective measure to prevent measles 15. This is of crucial importance for HCWs, with a view to their higher risk of exposure and of transmission to vulnerable patients. However, it should be noted that in at least 5 cases in this outbreak, measles occurred in personnel working in the hospital environment in support functions, highlighting the need to take into consideration the role of such personnel in the spread of the infection. Given that most of the support personnel belong to outsourced services, coordination is needed between occupational health unit and occupational health responsible of outsourced services.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail The full report can be found at the source URL. - Mod.ML There is no doubt that inadequate immunization levels are the major contributor to outbreaks of measles. Most of this is due to not receiving the 2 doses of vaccine due to personal or parenteral choice. Aggressive programs to reverse this unfortunate trend are needed to prevent outbreaks of this potentially lethal disease. The nosocomial setting as reflected in the 3rd post represents a special case situation. It is not clear why health care workers are not required to be immunized for measles. Additionally, when a case of measles is introduced into a health care facility, it has been my experience that the infection is not recognized promptly to minimize nosocomial spread. - Mod.LL   .

Updated recommendations and resources on HAV are provided.<br><br><strong> Situation -</strong><br> As of 14 Aug 2017, 333 confirmed or probable HAV cases have been reported in an ongoing local outbreak in San Diego County.

The cases range in age from 19 to 87 years (median = 44 years), and 227 (68 percent) are male, with 2 (1 percent) self-identifying as men who have sex with men (MSM). 131 (39 percent) of the HAV cases are homeless and reported injection or non-injection illicit drug use, 53 (16 percent) were homeless only, 36 (11 percent) were illicit drug users only, 76 (23 percent) were neither homeless nor drug users, and 37 (11 percent) had an unknown status for homelessness and drug use. Of the cases with test results available for review, 58 of 262 (22 percent) have chronic hepatitis C infection, and 15 of 261 (6 percent) have chronic hepatitis B infection. Despite the fact that the majority of the cases in this outbreak had a known indication for HAV immunization, only one case had been vaccinated prior to becoming infected: a 20-year-old who had routine HAV immunizations as a child. Most of the outbreak cases have been from the El Cajon/La Mesa area and downtown San Diego. Some cases have been confirmed in individuals who were only in the southern or northern parts of the county during their exposure periods. There are several clusters of epidemiologically associated cases, although no specific common food, beverage, or drug sources have been identified. Case clusters have been reported in individuals who have used the same homeless services providers and in the following types of facilities with shared restrooms: jails, single room occupancy hotels, residential drug treatment facilities, and assisted living facilities. 3 healthcare workers contracted HAV infection in this outbreak, as have four food handlers, although no secondary cases have resulted from the individuals working in these sensitive occupations. The CDC has confirmed HAV RNA in serum samples of 199 outbreak cases. Viral sequencing indicates that 8 unique, closely related strains of HAV genotype 1B are involved. These strains are different than those associated with an ongoing HAV outbreak in southeastern Michigan and the outbreaks linked to frozen strawberries in 2016 and pomegranate arils (seed pods) in 2013. The main outbreak strain in San Diego is identical to one of the strains causing an ongoing HAV outbreak in Santa Cruz County. Investigations of the confirmed and probable cases, as well as 37 suspect cases, are ongoing. 19 HAV cases have been reported in 2017 that are travel-related and are not part of the local outbreak totals. Of note, 1 case was diagnosed with symptomatic HAV infection 4 weeks after a trip to Paris, and viral sequence analysis indicated that the HAV strain causing his infection is identical to the one causing an outbreak among MSM in France.<br><br><strong> Background </strong><br> Person-to-person transmission through the fecal-oral route is the primary means of HAV transmission in the USA. Most infections result from close personal contact with an infected household member or sexual partner, or their fecally contaminated environment. Hands may play a significant role in the direct and indirect spread of HAV. Commonsource outbreaks and sporadic cases can also occur from exposure to fecally contaminated food or water. Individuals with increased risk for HAV infection include: travelers to countries with high or intermediate endemicity of HAV, MSM, users of injection and non-injection illicit drugs, persons with clotting factor disorders, and persons working with nonhuman primates. HAV outbreaks have been reported among the homeless, who have a higher morbidity and mortality when compared with the general population and an increased risk of infection due to living conditions. Individuals with chronic liver conditions, such as hepatitis B or C, are also recommended to get HAV vaccination because of their increased morbidity and mortality risks should they contract HAV.<br><br><strong> Recommendations for providers -</strong><br> 1. Consider HAV infection in individuals, especially the homeless and those who use illicit drugs, with discrete symptom onset and jaundice or elevated liver function tests. - Symptoms of concern include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, fever, malaise, dark urine, light-colored stool, and abdominal pain. - A complete serology panel with testing for hepatitis A, B, and C is recommended in symptomatic patients. HIV testing is also recommended for those with an undocumented HIV-status. - Serologic testing for HAV infection is not recommended in asymptomatic individuals or as screening before vaccination. 2. Promptly report all confirmed and suspect HAV cases to the Epidemiology Program. - Please fax Confidential Morbidity Report (CMRa)  , or call 619-692-8499 (Monday-Friday, 8 AM-5 PM), or 858565-5255 (after hours, during weekends, and on county-observed holidays). - Since this outbreak involves homeless individuals, providers are urged to contact the Epidemiology Program while suspected cases are still at the healthcare facility. This action will ensure that a public health investigator can interview the patient by phone for a risk history and will facilitate serum specimen submission to the San Diego County Public Health Laboratory for possible genotyping. 3. Provide post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for close contacts of confirmed HAV cases. - Susceptible people exposed to HAV should receive a dose of single-antigen HAV vaccine intramuscular (IM) immune globulin (IG) (0.1 mL/kg), or both, as soon as possible within 2 weeks of last exposure. The PEP dosage of IG was recently increased and is higher than that noted in the package insert. - The efficacy of combined HAV/Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine (Twinrix®) for PEP has not been evaluated, so it is not recommended for PEP. - Detailed information on PEP may be found on the CDPH California Department of Public Health Hepatitis A PEP Guidance Quicksheet (updated July 2017)   and the CDPH Hepatitis A PEP IG Administration Quicksheet (updated August 2017)  . 4. Provide HAV vaccine to homeless individuals, illicit drug users, patients with chronic liver diseases, MSM, and other at-risk people who are not already immunized, and to any individual who desires immunity to HAV. - The 1st dose of single-antigen HAV vaccine (Havrix®, Vaqta®) appears to protect more persons than the 1st dose of the combined HAV/HBV (Twinrix®) vaccine, but efficacy is comparable after completion of the respective series. Providers should consider short-term risks of exposure to HAV, the likelihood of follow-up to complete immunization, and the need for protection from HBV when selecting vaccines for those at risk. Immunization against HAV with existing supplies should not be delayed to obtain a different formulation of vaccine. - Providers who do not have available vaccine may direct patients to an immunization clinic at the nearest County Public Health Center. -Providers who care for homeless individuals may contact the Immunization Program at 619-692-5607 (Monday-Friday, 8 AM-5 PM) to learn how to obtain 317-funded HAV vaccine for use during this outbreak. - Homeless individuals and illicit drug users are also at higher risk for other vaccine preventable diseases and should be brought up-to-date with recommended vaccines per the relevant CDC immunization schedule. - Providers should check the San Diego Immunization Registry to see if patients are already vaccinated and note any vaccinations given. - Some individuals who are at risk for HAV may be uncomfortable disclosing the reasons that they are at risk to a provider, so the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices routinely recommends HAV vaccination \"for any person wishing to obtain immunity.\" - Adult HAV vaccination is covered by Medi-Cal without prior authorization. 5. Provide HAV vaccination to individuals who have frequent, ongoing close contact with homeless individuals and illicit drug users, and to all food handlers in San Diego County. - The County Public Health Officer recommends HAV vaccination for individuals with ongoing, close contact with homeless and illicit drug using individuals in San Diego County. This local recommendation is being made due to the current outbreak and includes persons working in health care, public safety, sanitation, homeless shelters, and homeless and behavioral service provider agencies. - The County Public Health Officer recommends HAV vaccination for all food handlers in San Diego County. This local recommendation is being made to reduce the potential risk of an ill food handler transmitting HAV to others. 6. Encourage those who are planning an international trip to check the CDC Travelers' Health website and to obtain recommended vaccinations before travel. - High-risk areas for HAV include parts of Africa and Asia, and moderate-risk areas include Central and South America, Eastern Europe, and parts of Asia. - There are currently HAV outbreaks associated with MSM occurring in New York City and in Western Europe, notably France, Portugal, and Spain. MSM should be vaccinated against HAV, especially prior to travel, and be instructed on prevention measures for HAV and other sexually transmitted illnesses. 7. Ensure that all healthcare workers use standard precautions in patient care to protect themselves against HAV. HAV, like norovirus, is a non-enveloped virus, and it may be similarly difficult to inactivate in the environment. Alcohol-based hand rubs and typically-used surface disinfectants may not be effective. Therefore, additional precautions to take include: - Wash hands with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds after providing care for an HAV patient. - Use contact precautions, in addition to standard precautions, in the care of diapered or incontinent HAV patients. - Wash hands with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds before eating and after using a restroom. - Use employee-designated restrooms when available, and do not touch the door handle directly when exiting a restroom. - Do not eat in patient care areas and never share food, drink or cigarettes with patients. - Do not handle a cell phone just before (or while) eating. Studies have shown that cell phones have high rates of surface contamination with enteric organisms (and for hospital employees, organisms associated with hospital acquired infections). - Perform environmental cleaning in areas housing HAV patients with bleach products or other products effective against norovirus. - HAV vaccine is recommended for unvaccinated healthcare workers caring for HAV patients or individuals at risk for HAV. The vaccine should be available and encouraged for other unvaccinated healthcare personnel concerned about increased exposure to HAV.  <br><br>Communicated by: Eric McDonald County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency California USA ProMED thanks Eric McDonald for this posting. An outbreak epicurve showing number of cases plotted against week of onset of symptoms is included in the report and can be found at the source URL above. Since mid-April 2017, about 15-20 cases per week have been reported and seems to be continuing at this rate. A more detailed description of the case cohort is included in this report and 66 percent had either homelessness and/or non-injection illicit drug use as risk factors. At this point, there have been 11 deaths in the cohort but it is not clear if co-infection with either HBV or HCV is a risk factor for death. Clearly, MSM is not a significant risk factor in this ongoing outbreak. - Mod. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ ","keywordsMatched":[]},"73":{"title":"Measles update (42): Europe, Middle East, Africa, Pacific\r\n\t","date":["18","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Measles update (42): Europe, Middle East, Africa, Pacific\r\n\t[EXTERNAL]","summary":"<br><br><strong> Pacific -</strong><br> 5 Australia (Perth, Western Australia)  Fri 18 Aug 2017 9:58 AM AWST Source: The West Australian edited Health authorities have confirmed a 3rd case of measles in a student from the Perth Waldorf School Western Australia, WA and warned there could be more.

Given the outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections in the region, and the clinical similarity of cases of that virus infection and CHIKV infection, one wonders how many cases that were not laboratory confirmed but clinically diagnosed as ZIKV infections were, in reality, CHIKV infections. It is also possible that a significant proportion of the population have been infected by CHIKV in the previous 3 years and are now immune. It seems likely, however, that CHIKV is now endemic in the Americas, and sporadic, small outbreaks may continue to occur as they do in Asia and Africa. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"199":{"title":"Invasive mosquito - UK: (England) ","date":["23","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH> Invasive mosquito - UK: (England) [EXTERNAL]","summary":"   Wed 23 Aug 2017, 1:38 PM Source: Express edited Health specialists have blitzed a clutch of notorious Asian tiger mosquitoes suspected to have smuggled their way into Britain through the Eurotunnel. The invasive Asiatic mosquitoes can carry dengue fever and the chikungunya virus, and attack in daylight. Experts from Public Health England destroyed the batch of mosquito eggs and larvae at the busy Ashford International truck stop earlier this month August 2017. This is the 2nd time that one of the planet's most dangerous insects  so-named because of its striped body and legs  has been discovered entering into the UK during the last year. Asian tiger mosquitoes  scientific name, _Aedes albopictus_  have been spreading across Europe and are blamed for up to a million global cases of chikungunya globally every year. The disease has no cure and leaves victims in a fever and with excruciating joint pains as well as headaches, nausea and rashes. There is a death risk of one in a thousand cases. France confirmed 4 cases in 2014 and there was an epidemic in Italy a decade ago. Asian tiger mosquitoes are spreading the disease through the way their eggs and larvae have been exported from native forest haunts in south east Asia in tyre imports. The grubs eggs can survive for months and larvae and pupae develop in small pockets of water retained by tyres. To counter the threat, the authorities are maintaining a \"mosquito surveillance programme\" at 30 UK ports and airports as well as checks at motorway services on routes from south coast ports and Eurotunnel. Dr Jenny Harries, deputy medical director at Public Health England, said: \"Through these activities we identified a small number of eggs and larvae from the _Aedes albopictus_ mosquito in traps at Ashford International truck stop. A 2014 report of _Aedes aegypti_ in southern England was rejected. A statement by Jolyon Medlock, head of Medical Entomology & Zoonoses Ecology, Public Health England, Microbiological Research Authority (MRA), Emergency Response Department, Health Protection and Medical Directorate, Porton Down, Salisbury stated, \"This is misleading information as no invasive aedes mosquitoes have been found in the UK. There have been a number of news articles in British newspapers recently 2014 about invasive mosquitoes, reporting mainly on efforts to increase surveillance for _Aedes albopictus_, however no confirmed reports of any invasive aedes mosquito have been found during this surveillance, nor have any reports been submitted to the Medical Entomology group at Public Health England.\" (see Invasive mosquito - UK (02): (England) comment http://promedmail.org/post/20140923.2795988).

It is rare in humans. It is unclear what symptoms occurred in the person and how the diagnosis was made. The following appears to be the most recent review of _B. mallei_ infections in humans including the description of disease manifestations: Van Zandt KE, Greer MT, Gelhaus HC. Glanders: an overview of infection in humans. Orphanet J Rare Dis. 2013 Sep 3;8:131. doi: 10.1186/1750-1172-8-131 (the full text and citations can be found at the original URL  ).<br><br><strong> \"Features of human clinical glanders </strong><br> \"General symptoms \"Many forms of glanders have been described, including chronic, disseminated, pulmonary, and septicemic. The variety of infections is largely explained by various routes of infection. Localized infections are generally regionally confined and typically characterized by foci of suppuration. The abscesses can ulcerate and drain for long periods of time. However, localized infections may disseminate, leading to pulmonary, septicemic, or multi-tissue infection 9. The most common clinical features of the eight laboratory-acquired infections from Fort Detrick included (in order of most common occurrence) afternoon to evening low-grade fever, malaise, fatigue, headache, myalgias including backache, lymphadenopathy, and chest pain. Approximately half of the patients not only felt better but were also clinically better for a period of time after the first wave of disease symptoms. This period lasted from a few days to 2 months then patients developed clinical signs of infection. \"Mucosal involvement \"Involvement of the eye and conjunctiva in a _B. mallei_ infection presents with excessive lacrimation and photophobia. Nasal involvement is characterized by inflammation and swelling of the nose, which is common following inhalation of _B. mallei_. This may be followed by copious nasal discharge. Additionally, infection may invade the nasal septum and bony tissues, causing fistulae and tissue destruction 9. The face may swell and regional lymph nodes may become inflamed. Infection may also extend lower in the respiratory tract, resulting in bronchitis which can be accompanied by cough and mucopurulent sputum production. Constitutional signs and symptoms such as fever and chills typically occur within the first few days following infection. Additionally, these symptoms may persist through treatment and be severe. Common signs and symptoms can include, but are not limited to, fever or low-grade fever in the afternoon to evening; chills with or without rigors; and severe headache 9. \"Cutaneous involvement \"Cutaneous manifestations include papular lesions that may erupt anywhere on the body with a more chronic, indolent course of infection. _B. mallei_ entry through an abrasion is typically followed by an inflammatory response, including pain and swelling. In these cases, a glanders node may appear as a single blister, gradually developing into an ulcer that may become hemorrhagic 18,35. A localized infection with a discharge typically develops at the entry site. Inflammation may extend along regional lymphatics and cause lymphangitis with numerous foci of suppuration along their course. The endotoxins present in _B. mallei_ strains affect the smooth muscle of the lymphatics 9 by enhancing the irritation and inflammation seen in the lymphatics. \"Pulmonary involvement \"A pulmonary infection typically results in pneumonia, pulmonary abscess, pleuritis, and plural effusion. Signs and symptoms of pulmonary infection can include cough, dyspnea, chest pain, and mucoplurent sputum. Nonspecific signs and symptoms such as fatigue, fever (often exceeding 102 deg F 38.9 deg C), chills, headache, myalgias, lymphangitis, sore throat, pleuritic chest pain, cough, tachypnea, dyspnea, discharge, and gastrointestinal signs often accompany respiratory infections 9. Many symptoms may take up to 2 to 3 weeks to develop. Nonspecific signs, such as dizziness, rigors, myalgia, nausea, night sweats, severe headache, tachycardia, weight loss, and mucosal eruptions are also usually present and may indicate a disseminated infection 9. \"Dissemination of infection \"Dissemination from local cutaneous or mucosal infection result in septicemia and the colonization of internal organs such as the spleen, liver, and lungs with the development of abscesses 9. Ultrasonography and computed tomography may reveal multiple, small discrete abscesses in both the liver and the kidney 23. These infections are typically associated with septic shock and high mortality.\" This publication describes what seems to have been the last of the cases of human _B. mallei_ in the USA: Srinivasan A, Kraus CN, DeShazer D, et al. Glanders in a military research microbiologist. N Engl J Med. 2001; 345: 256-8; (full text and citations can be found at the original URL \"Infection with _Burkholderia mallei_ (formerly _Pseudomonas mallei_) can cause a subcutaneous infection known as farcy or can disseminate to cause the condition known as glanders. In humans, acute infection with _B. mallei_ is characterized by necrosis of the tracheobronchial tree, pustular skin lesions, and either a febrile pneumonia, if the organism was inhaled, or signs of sepsis and multiple abscesses, if the skin was the portal of entry (1). At the turn of the 20th century, glanders was an important cause of death among horses, and there were secondary, often fatal, infections in humans (2). Because of the lethal and contagious nature of the disease, _B. mallei_ was considered an ideal agent for biologic warfare and was used for this purpose by Germany in World War I (3). \"Aggressive control measures essentially eliminated glanders from the West. However, with the resurgent concern about biologic warfare, _B. mallei_ is now being studied in laboratories worldwide. We describe here the first reported case of human glanders in the USA in more than 50 years and discuss some of the important events in the history of the disease and its initial eradication.<br><br><strong> \"Case report </strong><br> \"In March 2000, tender, left axillary adenopathy and fever (temperature, 38.6 deg C 101.5 deg F) developed in a 33 year old microbiologist at the US Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases who had type 1 diabetes mellitus. The patient had worked for 2 years investigating the basic microbiology of _B. mallei_ and did not routinely wear latex gloves. The adenopathy and fever persisted despite treatment for 10 days with a first-generation cephalosporin. An evaluation after this treatment, which included chest radiography as well as cultures of blood and urine, was unrevealing. During the next few weeks, the patient had increasing fatigue, night sweats, malaise, rigors, and weight loss. \"In early April 2000, his symptoms and adenopathy resolved during a 10-day course of clarithromycin, but he relapsed 4 days after the medication was stopped. On 2 May 2000, he was admitted to his local hospital with diabetic ketoacidosis. A computed tomographic (CT) scan showed multiple hepatic and splenic abscesses. \"On 4 May 2000, respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation developed, and the patient was transferred to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. Physical examination revealed a temperature of 40.3 deg C 104.5 deg F and a heart rate of 122 beats per minute. The patient had a grade 2/6 systolic murmur, coarse breath sounds, and moderate epigastric tenderness. Laboratory studies showed a white-cell count of 8300 per cubic millimeter, with 83 per cent neutrophils, 9 per cent monocytes, and 8 per cent lymphocytes. The hematocrit was 25.6 per cent. The concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were 53 U per liter and 56 U per liter, respectively, and the alkaline phosphatase was 197 IU per liter. Cultures of the patient's blood and a sample from a fine-needle aspiration biopsy of a liver abscess grew a small, bipolar, weakly staining, gram-negative rod that was identified by an automated bacterial-identification system as _Pseudomonas fluorescens_ or _P. putida_. However, gas-liquid chromatography of the cellular fatty acids (Microbial ID, Newark, Del.) placed the organism in the genus _Burkholderia_. Subsequent phenotypic testing and 16S ribosomal RNA gene-sequence analysis identified the organism as _B. mallei_. Initial susceptibility testing showed the isolate to be sensitive to imipenem, ceftazidime, and tetracycline. \"The patient was treated with imipenem and doxycycline, and there was rapid improvement. After two weeks, the imipenem was replaced by azithromycin, and the patient completed a six-month course of treatment with azithromycin and doxycycline. Although the organism was found retrospectively to be relatively resistant to azithromycin, a CT scan obtained after six months of treatment showed substantial improvement of the liver and spleen abscesses, and one year later the patient remained in good health.<br><br><strong> \"Discussion -</strong><br> This is the 1st reported human case of glanders in the English-language medical literature since 1949 (4) and it occurred in the context of research on agents of biologic warfare. \"Glanders may have been the first biologic weapon of the 20th century. During World War I, Germany had a program of biologic sabotage against several countries, including the United States, whereby cultures of _B. mallei_ and anthrax were distributed to undercover agents who attempted to infect livestock that were to be shipped to Allied countries (3). The intention was both the destruction of livestock and the transmission of the highly contagious, lethal agent from livestock to humans. It is currently suspected that attempts are being made to develop an aerosolized form of antibiotic-resistant _B. mallei_ that could become a biologic weapon as potent as anthrax. \"Glanders, an important human and veterinary disease, was eliminated without a vaccine or effective treatment. It appears to have been abolished by the veterinary use of a skin test to detect exposure to B. mallei combined with draconian agricultural measures to control infection (5). \"At the turn of the 20th century, Canada, Britain, and the USA all implemented glanders-control programs. By that time, the symptoms of equine glanders, which include fever and inflammation of the nasal mucosa with ultimate necrosis and obstruction of the oropharynx, had been well described (6). Laws were passed that required notification of the health department and the immediate slaughter of affected animals, with proper disposal of the carcasses. In addition, all horses on the premises where the infected horses were found had to be tested with the mallein skin test for exposure to _B. mallei_; any horses with a reaction also had to be slaughtered. Horses with no reaction were quarantined and then retested two to three weeks later. Furthermore, the equine contacts of the horses were traced to track down other horses that might have been exposed and then moved to other facilities. \"The case we describe illustrates the major clinical features of glanders, which can usually be traced to direct contact with _B. mallei_, as in workers exposed to animals with glanders (7) and in personnel who were exposed in laboratories during World War II (8). Although the patient discussed here could not recall a clear break in his skin or an accident in the laboratory, most reported occupational infections occur without recognized instances of exposure (9). As Robins commented in 1906, \"It is perhaps not advisable to be too dogmatic as to the invariable necessity of an abrasion being present in every case of human glanders . . . as in several such cases of our series it is distinctly stated that there was no abrasion.\" (7). As in our patient, _B. mallei_ often enters the body through the hand or arm. After an incubation period lasting between a few days and several weeks, local suppuration and regional lymphadenopathy occur. Constitutional symptoms often accompany the infection, with fever, rigors, and malaise predominating. If the infection is left untreated, abscesses in the lymph nodes will generally form, then break down and drain. \"Dissemination of the infection occurs 1 to 4 weeks after infection of the lymph nodes. Abscesses can be widespread, and _B. mallei_ can infect almost any tissue (7). Abscesses in the liver and the spleen, as were seen in our patient, appear to be relatively common, as does pulmonary involvement, including consolidation, abscesses, and pleural nodules. The acute onset and rapid resolution of the respiratory failure in our patient were more consistent with the respiratory distress syndrome associated with gram-negative bacteremia than with that associated with pulmonary glanders. Subcutaneous and intramuscular abscesses sometimes develop as well (7). \"There are few data regarding the antibiotic treatment of glanders, since the disease had largely disappeared by the time antibiotics became available. In vitro, ceftazidime, gentamicin, imipenem, doxycycline, and ciprofloxacin all have reliable activity against _B. mallei_ (10), and our patient's infection responded well to a combination of imipenem and doxycycline. Experimentally induced glanders also responds to a combination of sulfazine and trimethoprim (11). However, treatment of the disease in the setting of bioterrorism may be more difficult if the organism is drug-resistant. \"This case demonstrates the difficulties that microbiology laboratories may have in recognizing potential agents of biologic warfare. These microbes are rarely encountered and may be misidentified by conventional, phenotypic identification systems. Techniques such as cellular analysis of fatty acid and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing can be used to identify the organisms correctly, but these tests are not widely available. \"Finally, this case may serve as a harbinger of the resurgence of nearly forgotten diseases such as glanders, plague, smallpox, and anthrax. Research on these diseases is now being conducted in more laboratories, which increases the risk of occupational exposure. There is also the looming threat that some group will eventually mount a successful campaign of bioterrorism. Resources must be allocated both to prevent and to prepare for these frightening possibilities.

Ministers and food safety chiefs from around the European Union are set to meet on Tue 6 Sep 2017 in a bid to get countries to stop \"blaming and shaming\" each other over the scare involving the chemical fipronil. Millions of eggs have been pulled from supermarket shelves across Europe and dozens of poultry farms closed since the discovery of fipronil, which can harm human health, was made public on 1 Aug 2017. The issue has sparked a row between Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, the 3 countries at the epicentre of the crisis, about how long they knew about the problem. \"Blaming and shaming will bring us nowhere and I want to stop this,\" Vytenis Andriukaitis, the European Commissioner for health and food safety, told AFP as he announced the meeting. \"We need to work together to draw the necessary lessons and move forward instead.\" European Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said that \"this is not, let's be clear, a crisis meeting\" and it is being held next month September 2017 to get \"distance to the events\". Fipronil is commonly used to get rid of fleas, lice and ticks from animals but is banned by the European Union from use in the food industry. The EU insists there is no threat to human health, but the World Health Organization (WHO) says that when eaten in large quantities it can harm people's kidneys, liver and thyroid glands. Brussels said the 15 affected EU countries were Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Sweden, Britain, Austria, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Denmark, along with non-EU Switzerland. But in a sign the crisis is going global, Brussels also announced that Hong Kong had received some tainted eggs from the Netherlands, with the southern Chinese city becoming the 1st place in Asia known to be affected. As well as dealing with the immediate food safety issue, the EU is also seeking to calm tempers over the egg row after a series of divisive crises in the bloc in recent years, from Brexit to migration. Belgium earlier this week week of Mon 6 Aug 2017 accused the Netherlands of knowing about the fipronil eggs since November 2016 and failing to notify other countries. On Thu 10 Aug 2017 Dutch Health Minister Edith Schippers admitted the government had made \"errors\" but denied a cover-up. \"We were well aware of a report of the presence of fipronil in the pens of egg-laying hens in November 2016, but there was no indication at the time that fipronil itself was found in the eggs,\" said Schippers. A Dutch whistleblower separately said he had told the authorities that Chickfriend, the Dutch company at the centre of the scandal, was illegally using fipronil in the treatment of lice in chicken pens in The Netherlands. \"I am the anonymous whistleblower,\" Nick Hermens told the NPO public broadcaster. A Belgian company, Poultry Vision, has said it provided Chickfriend with the chemical. Dutch and Belgian investigators carried out coordinated raids on several premises on Thu 10 Aug 2017, arresting 2 people at Chickfriend. However, Belgium itself has been forced to admit that it knew about fipronil in eggs back in June 2017 but kept it secret for nearly 2 months because of a criminal investigation. Fresh discoveries of contaminated eggs have continued daily. Denmark said on Fri 11 Aug 2017 it had found 2 tonnes of fipronil-tainted scrambled eggs, bringing the total of contaminated eggs to 22 tonnes, mainly from Belgium. Poland said it had discovered about 40 000 eggs imported from Germany. French Agriculture Minister Stephane Travert said that since April 2017 the country had sold nearly 250 000 contaminated eggs, imported from Belgium and the Netherlands, but the risk for consumers was \"very low\" given French eating habits. The food scare is one of the biggest to hit Europe since the 2013 horsemeat scandal when equine meat was falsely labelled and mis-sold. Previous food scandals include contamination of chickens and eggs by dioxin in 1999, which began in Belgium, and mad-cow disease via cattle feed contaminated by the ground-up carcasses of animals infected with a deadly brain disorder - which ran from roughly 1986 to 1998 and started in Britain.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\.

Corr.SB, edited In the midst of the health scandal of the eggs contaminated with fipronil coming from the Netherlands, the prefecture capital, Arras of Pas-de-Calais confirms analyses carried out in a French farm. All eggs laid on the farm since 28 Jul 2017 will be destroyed. In parallel, the northern prefecture confirmed today 9 Aug 2017 that a processor of egg products based in Roncq (Nord department) received a delivery of batches of contaminated eggs. New investigations are underway. The prefecture of Pas-de-Calais confirmed this Wed 9 Aug 2017 the presence of fipronil in a chicken farm with laying hens in the department. It is the 1st French farm in which traces of this insecticide, which caused the crisis of contaminated eggs that originated in the Netherlands, have been found. At the same time, the prefecture of the Nord department Lille also confirmed that a processing company the department is also involved: a processor of egg products based in Roncq was supplied with batches of contaminated eggs. According to the Pas-de-Calais prefecture, cited by 20 Minutes, the risk of contamination of the chickens has been linked to the use, by the operator, of a pest control product, DEGA-16, containing the banned substance. The site manager warned the authorities one of his suppliers was using DEGA-16, reports La Voix du Nord. Indeed, Chickfriend, the Belgian distributor of the product, illegally added fipronil to the composition of its antiparasitic drug, intended to eradicate the red louse. Pending the results of the analyzes, the eggs from this farm had been previously set aside and their sale suspended as a precaution, on 28 Jul 2017. As the results confirmed the presence of fipronil, these eggs will all be destroyed. As for the manufacturing company located in Roncq, the northern prefecture provides details this Wed 9 Aug 2017 on its site  ; in French. It said that it had been informed on 8 Aug 2017 that the processor of egg products, Ovoservices, had also \"shipped batches of contaminated eggs.\" The authorities have told our colleagues that the company \"immediately put in place the recall measures for destruction of the eggs so that they could not be sold to its customers.\" \"At the same time, the Departmental Directorate of Populations is conducting an investigation in each farm in the eggs sector of the department to ensure that the DEGA 16 has not been used,\" said the Nord prefecture. The investigations should make it possible to check \"the possible diffusion\" of the products from this plant, on French and European territories. This likely means the distribution of products from this plant. - Mod.TG Faced with the growing crisis, professionals in the sector are reassuring. Xavier Garenaux, president of the Licques Volaille poultry Defense Union of (Pas-de-Calais), reminds us that chickens intended for slaughter are killed too young to know about a possible treatment against the red louse. Most farmed chickens live only 35 to 40 days (81 days for Label Rouge chickens). Only the eggs, resulting from the farming of laying hens, would therefore be potentially affected by this health scandal.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. The WHO has set a very low level of fipronil in the eggs. While this article does not tell us the level of fipronil in the eggs, it is believed to be above the admissible limits. Without regard to the amount of fipronil in the eggs, it is possible there are happy chickens as they are no longer facing mites. - With current fipronil levels, Germany's Federal Institute for Risk Assessment estimates a child who weighs around 16 kg (35 lb) could eat 1.7 eggs per day without reaching the threshold where fipronil levels become dangerous. This includes products that contain egg, like pancakes or pasta. An adult who weights 65 kg (143 lb) could eat 7 eggs a day. The levels currently measured in contaminated eggs aren't very high and thus not dangerous for adults, however authorities and experts have advised parents to not let their children eat contaminated eggs ( ). Additionally, according to the UK Food Standards Agency ( ): \"Our risk assessment, based on all the information available, indicates that as part of a normal healthy diet this low level of potential exposure is unlikely to be a risk to public health and there is no need for consumers to be concerned. Our advice is that there is no need for people to change the way they consume or cook eggs or products containing eggs.\" So while fipronil is not approved for use in food producing animals, the agencies monitoring this situation have a risk assessment in place indicating the risk is low to consumers, but nevertheless are acting out of caution to protect them. - Mod.TG In addition to the detection of fipronil-contaminated eggs in France reported above, such findings have now been reported from several other European countries, including Romania, Sweden, Switzerland, Luxembourg, and the UK. One ton of contaminated egg yolk liquid was uncovered in Romania later on Thu 10 Aug 2017, according to the country's veterinary health authority ANSVSA. It was the 1st discovery of contaminated egg product in eastern Europe since the scandal erupted. The egg yolk liquid was found in a warehouse on the western side of the country and had been imported from Germany, but \"none of the product has been offered for sale,\" said ANSVSA. British authorities reported earlier on Thu 10 Aug 2017 that around 700 000 eggs from affected Dutch farms had been distributed in Britain. The UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) said the eggs were mixed in large batches to be used in processed foods and not sold fresh, as they were in countries like the Netherlands and Germany. 4 major British grocery chains have withdrawn such products, including sandwiches and salads, the FSA said in a statement. \"However, as this represents 0.007 per cent of the eggs we consume in the UK every year, it remains the case that it is very unlikely that there is any risk to public health from consuming these foods,\" the statement said. The FSA also said that the recalls were not being carried out owing to safety concerns, but because the ingredient is not authorized for use. Luxembourg said that eggs sold in the discount supermarket Aldi had been withdrawn after one batch was found to contain sufficient levels of fipronil to potentially pose a threat to young children, who cannot consume as much as adults safely. Aldi earlier this month August 2017 pulled all Dutch eggs from its stores in Germany, but the company said on Thu 10 Aug 2017 that its German markets would restock eggs as of Fri 11 Aug 2017. Police in the Netherlands have detained 2 men suspected of being involved in the illegal use of fipronil. Millions of fipronil-contaminated eggs have been recalled since the scandal broke.

Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world. A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries. Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years. \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\" \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea\". The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years 2 million DALYs since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln 13 million DALYs in the US, and 36-mln 36 million DALYs in Ethiopia. \"Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,\" continues Prof Melegaro \"our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population. Tailoring immunization campaigns to achieve measles eradication goals is essential and currently, for some countries, this means considering also the role of unprotected adolescents and young adults.

It was 1st isolated in 1937 from the blood of a febrile woman in the West Nile district of Uganda, hence the name of the virus 2. WNV is maintained in nature in an enzootic cycle involving ornithophilic mosquitoes as transmission vectors and certain birds as reservoir hosts. Spillover from this cycle occasionally results in severe outbreaks. West Nile virus has been detected in a variety of bird species. Some infected birds, especially crows and jays, are known to get sick and die from the infection. Reporting and testing of dead birds is one way to check for the presence of West Nile virus in the environment. Some surveillance programs rely on citizens to report dead bird sightings to local authorities. West Nile virus is transmitted to birds through the bite of infected mosquitoes. Mosquitoes become infected by biting infected birds. Some birds that are predators (such as hawks and owls) or scavengers (such as crows) may become infected after eating sick or dead birds that were already infected with West Nile virus. Since West Nile virus was discovered in the United States in 1999, the virus has been detected in over 300 species of dead birds. Although some infected birds, especially crows and jays, frequently die of infection, most birds survive. Wildlife agencies routinely investigate sick or dead bird events if large numbers are impacted. This type of reporting could help with the early detection of illnesses like West Nile virus or avian influenza (bird flu), known to cause deaths in birds. There is no evidence that a person can get infected from handling live or dead infected birds. However, you should avoid bare-handed contact when handling any dead animal. If you must pick up a dead bird, use gloves or an inverted plastic bag to place the bird's carcass (body) in a garbage bag 3. References: 1.

Zika virus (or Zika) has been reported in Grenada. Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in Grenada are infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:  Women who are pregnant:  Do not travel to Grenada.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to Grenada or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers considering pregnancy:  Before you or your partner travel, talk to your health care provider about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection.  Wait before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.  If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex &ndash; or do not have sex &ndash; for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More Zika information for pregnant women  2.

Travelers considering pregnancy  Talk to your health care provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.

Children like him are already weakened by hunger and illness, but are now facing the threat of contracting cholera. The deadly disease is one of the fastest spreading in Somaliland and is claiming the lives of many, from the old to the very young. In some areas, 500 cases are reported each day. And quarantine tents have been put up to deal with the most severely ill until they can be housed on hospital wards. Cholera is a treatable disease contracted through drinking dirty water. But it is something much of Somaliland's 4.5 million population have had to resort to as they stand on the brink of starvation. With more than half their livestock wiped out and no rain for 3 years, people consume whatever water they can find, even if it is contaminated by human waste or rotting animal carcasses. ITV News also spoke to a father who has lost 3 of his children to cholera, \"a father who had to bury 3 young children, who were only yesterday 6 Aug 2017 calling me dad and playing with me.\" That is what has driven him to educate others about cholera so that they don't have to go through the devastation he has. Authorities have rushed to put together teams of volunteers to go into communities to help people avoid contracting cholera. The disease  which has not been seen in developed countries like the UK for over 100 years  can easily be treated using an oral rehydration sachet. But without treatment, a person can quickly become dehydrated, go into shock and die. For the people of Somaliland, fighting disease is just one of their daily struggles while they wait for the rain to come and aid to arrive.

The 1st 2 cases of cholera were tested positive by National Institute of Health Islamabad on Mon 31 Jul 2017 and another 2 confirmed positive for the infection on Fri 4 Aug 2017. All the 4 patients were undergoing treatment at Benazir Bhutto Hospital BH where as many as 4 more suspects of the infection have been admitted for treatment. Data collected by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017 reveals that the allied hospitals have sent stool samples of over 10 child patients to NIH for confirmation of cholera in last week week of Sun 6 Aug 2017. On Sat 12 Aug 2017, as many as 20 child patients with severe diarrhoea were admitted at the BBH of which 4 were suspected as patients of cholera and their stool samples were sent to NIH for confirmation, said Associate Professor of Paediatrics at Rawalpindi Medical University Dr Tariq Saeed when contacted by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017. He added the hospital has not received confirmation reports from the NIH because of holidays there from Saturday to Monday. However, we have been keeping the suspects in isolation under strict monitoring, he said. He added that repeated rainfalls in the region and water inundation inside and outside homes in a number of localities particularly in thickly populated areas of the city are causing contamination of water and foodstuff that increases chances of spread of a number of infections among population while children are at greater risk of contracting life-threatening infections including cholera. It is important that the transmission of cholera occurs primarily by drinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the feces (waste product) of an infected person, including one with no apparent symptoms. It is observed that heavy rainfall causes collection of heavily contaminated water in streets and houses and the waste water flooding out of various nullahs watercourses including Nullah Leh in town causes infections including cholera, typhoid, dysentery, gastroenteritis, hepatitis A and E, shigellosis and giardiasis. Professor Tariq said the consumption of contaminated water and foodstuff causes cholera, an infection in the small intestine caused by bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. Its main symptoms are watery diarrhea and vomiting that can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, and death in cases which are not treated in time, he said. Health experts say that to avoid cholera and other infections, one must use boiled water for drinking and should use vegetables after washing with clean water and it must be kept in mind that raw vegetables should not be eaten in the existing weather conditions instead these should be used after cooking. To a query, Professor Tariq said the heavy rainfall and water accumulation may contaminate water at sources and there may be chances of contamination of water at tube wells so individuals must boil water before drinking to avoid cholera and other infections. He added the appearance of cholera is alarming and it is time for people to take extra ordinary preventive measures to safeguard their children and themselves from the disease. In case water is accumulated inside home due to heavy rainfall and flooded out of sewage lines, it must be wiped out immediately and the space should be washed with clean water as soon as possible to avoid infections. Avoiding inundation of contaminated water inside homes is a must to avoid cholera and other infections, said Professor Tariq.

The health workers deputed from the District Health Office (DHO) have been treating locals with preventive medicines while the critical ones have been undergoing treatment in the Bahadurgunj Hospital in the district. Meanwhile, the DHO has urged the general public to take precautions and preventive measures as there is high risk of diarrhoea spreading in the flood-hit areas. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ Aggressive interventions to stem outbreaks of cholera include providing sources of clean water and a vaccination campaign.

Zika virus (or Zika) has been reported in Guinea-Bissau. Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in Guinea-Bissau are infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:  Women who are pregnant:  Do not travel to Guinea-Bissau.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to Guinea-Bissau or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.

Children like him are already weakened by hunger and illness, but are now facing the threat of contracting cholera. The deadly disease is one of the fastest spreading in Somaliland and is claiming the lives of many, from the old to the very young. In some areas, 500 cases are reported each day. And quarantine tents have been put up to deal with the most severely ill until they can be housed on hospital wards. Cholera is a treatable disease contracted through drinking dirty water. But it is something much of Somaliland's 4.5 million population have had to resort to as they stand on the brink of starvation. With more than half their livestock wiped out and no rain for 3 years, people consume whatever water they can find, even if it is contaminated by human waste or rotting animal carcasses. ITV News also spoke to a father who has lost 3 of his children to cholera, \"a father who had to bury 3 young children, who were only yesterday 6 Aug 2017 calling me dad and playing with me.\" That is what has driven him to educate others about cholera so that they don't have to go through the devastation he has. Authorities have rushed to put together teams of volunteers to go into communities to help people avoid contracting cholera. The disease  which has not been seen in developed countries like the UK for over 100 years  can easily be treated using an oral rehydration sachet. But without treatment, a person can quickly become dehydrated, go into shock and die. For the people of Somaliland, fighting disease is just one of their daily struggles while they wait for the rain to come and aid to arrive.

The 1st 2 cases of cholera were tested positive by National Institute of Health Islamabad on Mon 31 Jul 2017 and another 2 confirmed positive for the infection on Fri 4 Aug 2017. All the 4 patients were undergoing treatment at Benazir Bhutto Hospital BH where as many as 4 more suspects of the infection have been admitted for treatment. Data collected by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017 reveals that the allied hospitals have sent stool samples of over 10 child patients to NIH for confirmation of cholera in last week week of Sun 6 Aug 2017. On Sat 12 Aug 2017, as many as 20 child patients with severe diarrhoea were admitted at the BBH of which 4 were suspected as patients of cholera and their stool samples were sent to NIH for confirmation, said Associate Professor of Paediatrics at Rawalpindi Medical University Dr Tariq Saeed when contacted by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017. He added the hospital has not received confirmation reports from the NIH because of holidays there from Saturday to Monday. However, we have been keeping the suspects in isolation under strict monitoring, he said. He added that repeated rainfalls in the region and water inundation inside and outside homes in a number of localities particularly in thickly populated areas of the city are causing contamination of water and foodstuff that increases chances of spread of a number of infections among population while children are at greater risk of contracting life-threatening infections including cholera. It is important that the transmission of cholera occurs primarily by drinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the feces (waste product) of an infected person, including one with no apparent symptoms. It is observed that heavy rainfall causes collection of heavily contaminated water in streets and houses and the waste water flooding out of various nullahs watercourses including Nullah Leh in town causes infections including cholera, typhoid, dysentery, gastroenteritis, hepatitis A and E, shigellosis and giardiasis. Professor Tariq said the consumption of contaminated water and foodstuff causes cholera, an infection in the small intestine caused by bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. Its main symptoms are watery diarrhea and vomiting that can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, and death in cases which are not treated in time, he said. Health experts say that to avoid cholera and other infections, one must use boiled water for drinking and should use vegetables after washing with clean water and it must be kept in mind that raw vegetables should not be eaten in the existing weather conditions instead these should be used after cooking. To a query, Professor Tariq said the heavy rainfall and water accumulation may contaminate water at sources and there may be chances of contamination of water at tube wells so individuals must boil water before drinking to avoid cholera and other infections. He added the appearance of cholera is alarming and it is time for people to take extra ordinary preventive measures to safeguard their children and themselves from the disease. In case water is accumulated inside home due to heavy rainfall and flooded out of sewage lines, it must be wiped out immediately and the space should be washed with clean water as soon as possible to avoid infections. Avoiding inundation of contaminated water inside homes is a must to avoid cholera and other infections, said Professor Tariq.

No more reports will be submitted.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail The Chinese giant salamander (_Andrias davidianus_) is the largest amphibian in the world. It can grow to more than one meter (3.3 ft) in length. This species used to be widespread in central, south western, and southern China, but it is considered to be critically endangered. It has declined catastrophically over the last 30 years, principally due to over-exploitation, and it is now very rare, with few surviving populations known. Commercial over-exploitation for human consumption is the main threat to this species. It has also suffered from habitat destruction (such as from the construction of dams) and habitat degradation (such as water pollution from mines). For a picture go to  . In 2010, an outbreak of disease occurred amongst farmed Chinese giant salamanders in Shanxi Province, China. Clinical signs included anorexia, lethargy, ecchymosis, and swollen areas on the head and limbs and skin ulceration. An investigation was carried out and they isolated for the 1st time a ranavirus infection associated with mass mortality in Chinese giant salamanders. This virus was named Chinese giant salamander virus (CGSV-L). This virus has not been studied in the wild. It might be possible that it circulates causing little impact, but under the stressing circumstances that might arise in captivity the virulence increases. - Mod.PMB   .

Ministers and food safety chiefs from around the European Union are set to meet on Tue 6 Sep 2017 in a bid to get countries to stop \"blaming and shaming\" each other over the scare involving the chemical fipronil. Millions of eggs have been pulled from supermarket shelves across Europe and dozens of poultry farms closed since the discovery of fipronil, which can harm human health, was made public on 1 Aug 2017. The issue has sparked a row between Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, the 3 countries at the epicentre of the crisis, about how long they knew about the problem. \"Blaming and shaming will bring us nowhere and I want to stop this,\" Vytenis Andriukaitis, the European Commissioner for health and food safety, told AFP as he announced the meeting. \"We need to work together to draw the necessary lessons and move forward instead.\" European Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said that \"this is not, let's be clear, a crisis meeting\" and it is being held next month September 2017 to get \"distance to the events\". Fipronil is commonly used to get rid of fleas, lice and ticks from animals but is banned by the European Union from use in the food industry. The EU insists there is no threat to human health, but the World Health Organization (WHO) says that when eaten in large quantities it can harm people's kidneys, liver and thyroid glands. Brussels said the 15 affected EU countries were Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Sweden, Britain, Austria, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Denmark, along with non-EU Switzerland. But in a sign the crisis is going global, Brussels also announced that Hong Kong had received some tainted eggs from the Netherlands, with the southern Chinese city becoming the 1st place in Asia known to be affected. As well as dealing with the immediate food safety issue, the EU is also seeking to calm tempers over the egg row after a series of divisive crises in the bloc in recent years, from Brexit to migration. Belgium earlier this week week of Mon 6 Aug 2017 accused the Netherlands of knowing about the fipronil eggs since November 2016 and failing to notify other countries. On Thu 10 Aug 2017 Dutch Health Minister Edith Schippers admitted the government had made \"errors\" but denied a cover-up. \"We were well aware of a report of the presence of fipronil in the pens of egg-laying hens in November 2016, but there was no indication at the time that fipronil itself was found in the eggs,\" said Schippers. A Dutch whistleblower separately said he had told the authorities that Chickfriend, the Dutch company at the centre of the scandal, was illegally using fipronil in the treatment of lice in chicken pens in The Netherlands. \"I am the anonymous whistleblower,\" Nick Hermens told the NPO public broadcaster. A Belgian company, Poultry Vision, has said it provided Chickfriend with the chemical. Dutch and Belgian investigators carried out coordinated raids on several premises on Thu 10 Aug 2017, arresting 2 people at Chickfriend. However, Belgium itself has been forced to admit that it knew about fipronil in eggs back in June 2017 but kept it secret for nearly 2 months because of a criminal investigation. Fresh discoveries of contaminated eggs have continued daily. Denmark said on Fri 11 Aug 2017 it had found 2 tonnes of fipronil-tainted scrambled eggs, bringing the total of contaminated eggs to 22 tonnes, mainly from Belgium. Poland said it had discovered about 40 000 eggs imported from Germany. French Agriculture Minister Stephane Travert said that since April 2017 the country had sold nearly 250 000 contaminated eggs, imported from Belgium and the Netherlands, but the risk for consumers was \"very low\" given French eating habits. The food scare is one of the biggest to hit Europe since the 2013 horsemeat scandal when equine meat was falsely labelled and mis-sold. Previous food scandals include contamination of chickens and eggs by dioxin in 1999, which began in Belgium, and mad-cow disease via cattle feed contaminated by the ground-up carcasses of animals infected with a deadly brain disorder - which ran from roughly 1986 to 1998 and started in Britain.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\.

Pointing out that carcasses of infected monkeys found in Goa's hinterlands have mostly been of the langoor species, officials say that a systematic study with a database of the same is thus required to evaluate this phenomenon. As many as 82 human cases of KFD or monkey fever have been registered in the state from January to June, this year 2017. The incidence of disease, however, appears less menacing in the face of 3 deaths and 284 cases in 2016; it is slowly spreading to other talukas. In 2015, when the disease was 1st detected in Goa, it was limited to Sattari taluka. The following year, a few cases were detected in Dharbandora, while this year 2017, 5 persons from Pernem taluka were detected with the virus. There are no figures, however, of the source of this disease, i.e. the monkeys. Forest officials, however, stated that of the 2 monkey species in Goa, only one was seen dying of the infection. \"There are 2 species of monkeys in Goa: Macacque and the Langoor. We have noticed that the monkey carcasses have only been of the langoor species. However, we require a systematic study with database to review this,\" an official said. Sources in the department urged that a body of experts appointed by the high court is required to provide scientifically-backed data. \"These monkeys are very social animals and move in groups. We cannot identify the disease by sight on a particular monkey, but since their ticks are the main carriers of the disease, we can assume that the entire group can be infected if even one of them has it. There should be continuous observation and analysis over a period of time to arrive at a conclusion,\" they said. The disease is caused by a virus belonging to the family Flaviviridae, which also includes yellow fever and dengue fever. The symptoms of the disease include a high fever with frontal headaches, followed by haemorrhagic symptoms, such as bleeding from the nasal cavity, throat, and gums, as well as gastrointestinal bleeding. Other symptoms include vomiting, muscle stiffness, tremors, absent reflexes, and mental disturbances Dobler, Gerhard (2010). \"Zoonotic tick-borne flaviviruses.\" Veterinary Microbiology. 140 (3/4): 221-228.

There will be muscle aches and weakness during this period, and the affected person is unable to engage in physical activities. Prophylaxis by vaccination, as well as preventive measures like protective clothing, tick control, and mosquito control are advised. The vaccine for KFDV consists of formalin-inactivated KFDV. The vaccine has a 62.4 percent effectiveness rate for individuals who receive 2 doses. For individuals who receive an additional dose, the effectiveness increases to 82. \"Coverage and Effectiveness of Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) Vaccine in Karnataka, South India, 2005-10.\" Plos Neglected Tropical Diseases. 7 (1): 1-4.

Children like him are already weakened by hunger and illness, but are now facing the threat of contracting cholera. The deadly disease is one of the fastest spreading in Somaliland and is claiming the lives of many, from the old to the very young. In some areas, 500 cases are reported each day. And quarantine tents have been put up to deal with the most severely ill until they can be housed on hospital wards. Cholera is a treatable disease contracted through drinking dirty water. But it is something much of Somaliland's 4.5 million population have had to resort to as they stand on the brink of starvation. With more than half their livestock wiped out and no rain for 3 years, people consume whatever water they can find, even if it is contaminated by human waste or rotting animal carcasses. ITV News also spoke to a father who has lost 3 of his children to cholera, \"a father who had to bury 3 young children, who were only yesterday 6 Aug 2017 calling me dad and playing with me.\" That is what has driven him to educate others about cholera so that they don't have to go through the devastation he has. Authorities have rushed to put together teams of volunteers to go into communities to help people avoid contracting cholera. The disease  which has not been seen in developed countries like the UK for over 100 years  can easily be treated using an oral rehydration sachet. But without treatment, a person can quickly become dehydrated, go into shock and die. For the people of Somaliland, fighting disease is just one of their daily struggles while they wait for the rain to come and aid to arrive. The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are: - Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_; - Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam; - Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however, have suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be effective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and outbreak situations (63, 64).<br><br><strong> \"References </strong><br> 57.

The state reported 482 cases of JE of which 67 resulted in death, as per the data. According to the additional director (health), Dr Pushkar Anand, 139 deaths that mostly included children have been reported from the paediatric ward of State-run Baba Raghav Das Medical College this year 2017 in UP; 6 cases of deaths were reported from 12-14 Aug 2017, he added. In UP, the most severely affected districts are Gorakhpur, Maharajganj, Kushinagar, Basti, Siddharthanagar, Sant Kabir Nagar, Deoria, and Mau. NVBDCP data reveals that in 2010, UP reported 3540 cases of AES, which claimed 494 lives. JE saw 325 cases being reported in that year, and 59 lives were lost. Similarly in 2011, 579 deaths in 3492 cases of AES were reported, while JE claimed 27 lives out of 224 cases. In 2012, a year that saw a change of government in the state, 3484 cases of AES were reported and 557 patients died, while 139 cases of JE and 23 deaths were also reported. The AES death toll breached the 600 mark for the 1st time in 2013. 609 out of 3096 cases reported resulted in deaths. JE deaths too crossed the 40-figure-mark in the same year with 47 deaths reported in 281 cases. In 2014, out of the 3329 AES cases reported, there were deaths, while for JE it was 34 deaths out of 191 cases. In 2015, as many as 479 lives were lost due to AES of which 2894 cases were reported. JE claimed 42 lives from the 351 reported cases, according to the official data. In 2016, 3919 cases of AES were reported in which 621 lives were lost. The death toll due to JE stood at an all time high of 73 out of 410 cases reported. Apart from UP, this year 2017, AES and JE deaths were reported from Assam, Bihar, Manipur, Odisha, and West Bengal. In Bihar, 29 AES deaths were reported from 66 cases reported, while 7 JE deaths were reported out of 19 cases. Manipur saw 6 AES and 6 JE deaths. As many as 690 AES cases were reported, while 141 JE cases were reported in the state. In Odisha, 10 AES deaths out of 473 cases were reported. However no death due to JE took place in the state, although 13 cases were reported. In West Bengal, 81 AES deaths took place out of 826 cases reported this year, while 10 JE deaths were reported out of 37 cases reported. Overall, 5926 cases of AES have been reported in the country till 13 Aug 2017, of which 406 deaths have been reported. The country also witnessed 93 JE deaths this year out of 903 cases reported in the same period. Speaking to PTI, Dr RN Singh, who has been working in the field of prevention of encephalitis said that until and unless, there is a complete ban on open defecation and installation of India Mark handpumps, the disease cannot be eradicated.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail As with cases of encephalitis in Uttar Pradesh and the other states in northeastern India mentioned above, not all encephalitis cases are due to JE virus infections and are classified as AES with undetermined etiology. AES is a term used for multiple etiologies or often when no etiology has been determined. The report above does not indicate whether JE vaccination campaigns have been active in the affected states this year (2017). Other etiologies for AES, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_), lychee fruit consumption, and agricultural-related toxicants have been proposed. The report above does not indicate what the etiologies of the AES cases might be. Getting to an accurate diagnosis in these cases of AES will require active field surveillance with epidemiological studies supported by timely laboratory testing. Until valid diagnoses of AES are determined and the routes of transmission are known, prevention will not be possible. The comments of Dr RN Sing in the report above citing the need for access to clean water again raise the possibility of enteropathogens as a major cause of AES. In any case, access to clean water is important for public health generally, including for AES prevention. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"31":{"title":"Japanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (UP) AES due to\r\n\tscrub typhus ","date":["16","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (UP) AES due to\r\n\tscrub typhus [EXTERNAL]","summary":"   Wed 16 Aug 2017 Source: The Hindu edited Based on a study carried out in 2015, a team led by Dr Manoj V Murhekar, Director of the Chennai-based National Institute of Epidemiology, found scrub typhus to be responsible for acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in 63 percent of patients admitted to the Baba Raghav Das Medical College Hospital in Gorakhpur Uttar Pradesh state, UP. The study was repeated last year 2016 by the same team by comparing children with AES and healthy children who are siblings of the patients or living in the same village. It found that AES patients had 35 times greater possibility of having antibodies against scrub typhus compared with healthy children thereby confirming that AES was caused by scrub typhus. Excerpts from an interview with Dr Manoj Murhekar: - Have you carried out any studies this year 2017 on children admitted to BRD hospital with AES? How likely is scrub typhus to have caused AES this year as well? The causation of the disease or etiology will not change from year to year. In 2015 and 2016 we have seen that scrub typhus was responsible for over 60 percent of AES and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) causes less than 10 percent of AES in children below 15 years. Scrub typhus was responsible for over 60 percent of AES even in 2014. There is vaccination for JE virus but no intervention has been implemented widely for scrub typhus. So the etiology wouldn't have changed compared with last year. - Besides BRD hospital, is there any other referral hospital in that region? What is the extent of population that BRD hospital caters to? Except BRD hospital, there is no referral hospital in the Gorakhpur Division in Uttar Pradesh. The hospital caters to people living in Gorakhpur Division (4 districts) and Basti division in UP, Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, and even Nepal. - Why do we see a large number of children with AES each year at BRD hospital? There is a lot of scrub typhus fever in the community. Between 20-25 percent of fever in children being attended to at PHCs primary health centres is caused by scrub typhus. Only a small percentage of these children progress to AES. Most of the cases in the community are sub-clinical with no symptoms or very mild fever. Only some children with fever will progress to AES. The hospital sees 1500-2000 cases each year and 80 percent of these cases are during July to October. About 1/4 of patients with AES are adults. Generally, adults develop immunity against scrub typhus, so only those who have not been exposed to scrub typhus will progress to AES. - Is there any specific reason why scrub typhus is found only in this region? It is not correct to say it is restricted only to this region. Scrub typhus is found even in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu. In Tamil Nadu it is found in Vellore and Thiruvallur districts. About 7-10 percent of fever in these 2 districts is caused by scrub typhus. The reason why it is found only in these 2 districts in Tamil Nadu is because researchers have investigated for scrub typhus in these 2 districts. - Is it possible to treat scrub typhus and prevent the infection from progressing to AES? In the beginning of this year 2017, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) recommended to the Uttar Pradesh government to use doxycycline antibiotic to treat children with fever for 5 days. The ICMR shared an algorithm with the Uttar Pradesh government which tells which fever should be treated with doxycycline and the dosage. If treated early with doxycycline, then children will not progress to AES. This prevention strategy has to be implemented widely and even by doctors in the private sector before we see results. In July 2017, ICMR and doctors from the Christian Medical College, Vellore went to Gorakhpur and conducted awareness campaign for Indian Medical Association (IMA) and Indian Association of Paediatrics (IAP) doctors, chief medical officers, and programme officers. - Why is the death rate high at 20 percent in children with AES? At BRD hospital, we have observed patients with AES. The mortality is about 20 percent due to multi-organ involvement. In the case of AES caused by scrub typhus, the mortality is about 15-17 percent compared with AES caused by JE. This is because treatment started early with azithromycin can treat AES caused by scrub typhus. Azithromycin is in the class of medicines as doxycycline but easy to administer in sick children as it is given intravenously. - What is vaccine coverage for Japanese encephalitis and why don't we see herd immunity with this vaccine? In 2012, the vaccine coverage for Japanese encephalitis was only 50 percent but has improved to 75 percent now. A study we carried out in 2015 found 75 percent coverage for the 1st dose and only 42 percent for the 2nd dose. 3 of the 4 children aged 25-36 months in Gorakhpur region had received at least one dose of the vaccine. We need 2 doses of the vaccine  during 9-12 months for the 1st dose and 16-24 months for the 2nd dose  for optimal protection. With just one dose, the efficacy is over 80 percent. No studies have been done to find the duration of protection. With increasing vaccine coverage the incidence of JE has dropped from about 20 percent a few years ago to less than 10 percent now. In the case of mosquito-borne diseases, herd immunity will not play a major role. So increasing the vaccine coverage should be a priority.

AES is a term used for multiple etiologies or often when no etiology has been determined. The report above implicates scrub typhus as a major cause of AES. It is not clear why most of the AES cases are in children, but scrub typhus infections occur in people of all ages. Scrub typhus in India has been receiving additional attention in recent years. a 2013 review article indicated that scrub typhus is seriously neglected and under-reported ( ). ProMED-mail has posted multiple reports of scrub typhus in several Indian states in the past, especially since 2011. For background information, see ProMED-mail post Scrub typhus - India (05): background http://promedmail.org/post/20111208.3546. The report above indicates that JE vaccination campaigns have been active there this year (2017) but have not provided complete coverage. Other etiologies for AES, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_), lychee fruit consumption, and agricultural-related toxicants have been proposed. The above report is another implicating scrub typhus as an important etiology of the AES cases. However, getting to an accurate diagnosis in these cases of AES will require active field surveillance with epidemiological studies supported by timely laboratory testing. Prospective studies are required to confirm the degree of scrub typhus involvement in AES cases. - Mod.TY A recent report in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases (1), which ProMED-mail posted (2), indicated that the scrub typhus may account for a significant proportion of acute encephalitis syndrome in the northeastern Indian state of Assam. ProMED-mail has posted multiple reports of scrub typhus in several Indian states, especially since 2011 (3), so that it is not surprising that scrub typhus could account for many cases of acute encephalitis in other Indian states (4). However, I noted at the time in the moderator comments (2) that although headache is a common part of the symptom complex of scrub typhus, acute encephalitis or meningoencephalitis, with a history of altered sensorium, seizures or neck stiffness, and abnormal neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid findings, complicates a minority of scrub typhus cases (5-7).

The 1st 2 cases of cholera were tested positive by National Institute of Health Islamabad on Mon 31 Jul 2017 and another 2 confirmed positive for the infection on Fri 4 Aug 2017. All the 4 patients were undergoing treatment at Benazir Bhutto Hospital BH where as many as 4 more suspects of the infection have been admitted for treatment. Data collected by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017 reveals that the allied hospitals have sent stool samples of over 10 child patients to NIH for confirmation of cholera in last week week of Sun 6 Aug 2017. On Sat 12 Aug 2017, as many as 20 child patients with severe diarrhoea were admitted at the BBH of which 4 were suspected as patients of cholera and their stool samples were sent to NIH for confirmation, said Associate Professor of Paediatrics at Rawalpindi Medical University Dr Tariq Saeed when contacted by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017. He added the hospital has not received confirmation reports from the NIH because of holidays there from Saturday to Monday. However, we have been keeping the suspects in isolation under strict monitoring, he said. He added that repeated rainfalls in the region and water inundation inside and outside homes in a number of localities particularly in thickly populated areas of the city are causing contamination of water and foodstuff that increases chances of spread of a number of infections among population while children are at greater risk of contracting life-threatening infections including cholera. It is important that the transmission of cholera occurs primarily by drinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the feces (waste product) of an infected person, including one with no apparent symptoms. It is observed that heavy rainfall causes collection of heavily contaminated water in streets and houses and the waste water flooding out of various nullahs watercourses including Nullah Leh in town causes infections including cholera, typhoid, dysentery, gastroenteritis, hepatitis A and E, shigellosis and giardiasis. Professor Tariq said the consumption of contaminated water and foodstuff causes cholera, an infection in the small intestine caused by bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. Its main symptoms are watery diarrhea and vomiting that can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, and death in cases which are not treated in time, he said. Health experts say that to avoid cholera and other infections, one must use boiled water for drinking and should use vegetables after washing with clean water and it must be kept in mind that raw vegetables should not be eaten in the existing weather conditions instead these should be used after cooking. To a query, Professor Tariq said the heavy rainfall and water accumulation may contaminate water at sources and there may be chances of contamination of water at tube wells so individuals must boil water before drinking to avoid cholera and other infections. He added the appearance of cholera is alarming and it is time for people to take extra ordinary preventive measures to safeguard their children and themselves from the disease. In case water is accumulated inside home due to heavy rainfall and flooded out of sewage lines, it must be wiped out immediately and the space should be washed with clean water as soon as possible to avoid infections. Avoiding inundation of contaminated water inside homes is a must to avoid cholera and other infections, said Professor Tariq. Byline: Muhammad Qasim  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-SoAs Aggressive interventions to stem outbreaks of cholera include providing sources of clean water and a vaccination campaign. The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80 percent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:  - Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_; - Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65 percent (95 percent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam;  - Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however, have suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be effective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and outbreak situations (63, 64).<br><br><strong> \"References </strong><br> 57.

Emerg Microbes Infect. 2017; 6(8): e69. doi: 10.1038/emi.2017.<br><br><strong>59  Abstract </strong><br> Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has recently been associated with an increased incidence of neonatal microcephaly and other neurological disorders. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito bite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some cases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main vector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other mosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the virus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit ZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of laboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. Interestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the midgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in Recife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially fed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx. quinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced. Collectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range of ZIKV vectors than anticipated.  <br><br>Communicated by: Roland Hübner Superior Health Council Brussels Belgium Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active virus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their ability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step toward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_ fed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in saliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing. The study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a competent vector. Several other studies have shown this species to be inefficient vectors or refractory to Zika virus infection. One wonders if the specific _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ used or the Zika virus isolates with which they were tested could account for these very different results. Resolving these discrepancies is important because this mosquito species is very widely distributed around the world and bears directly on risk of outbreaks in geographic areas where _Aedes aegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_ , Zika virus vectors, do not occur. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"66":{"title":"Chlorine gas - India: (UT) waterworks, RFI ","date":["18","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Chlorine gas - India: (UT) waterworks, RFI [EXTERNAL]","summary":"   Fri 18 Aug 2017 Source: India Times edited In the early hours of Fri 18 Aug 2017, 17 people, including 5 children, were taken ill after chlorine gas leakage from a cylinder at a waterworks unit of Uttarakhand Jal Sansthan in Dehradun. Police rushed to the spot immediately and threw the leaking cylinder into the water to neutralise it, SP (City) Pradeep Kumar Rai, told PTI. People living in the waterworks area including children, mostly sleeping at that hour, were rushed to different hospitals in the city after they complained of difficulty in breathing and some of them especially children even fainted, the SP (city) said. Altogether 17 people were hospitalized: 8 were admitted in Mahanth Indresh hospital, 5 in Max Hospital, and 4 in CMI hospital, the SP said. However, all of them are out of danger with a majority already discharged from hospitals, he said. The Managing Director of Jan Sansthan said an inquiry is being conducted into the gas leak at the waterworks. Where the homes near there? Perhaps above the waterworks unit? How big was the cylinder to cause this kind of problem? These are likely rhetorical questions but answers would provide insight into what really happened. Chlorine gas is a pulmonary irritant with intermediate water solubility that causes acute damage in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Exposure to low concentrations of chlorine for prolonged periods may have destructive effects, as might very short-term exposure to high concentrations. Long-term complications may occur after breathing in high concentrations of chlorine. Complications are more likely to be seen in people who develop severe health problems such as fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema) following the initial exposure. How chlorine works - The extent of poisoning caused by chlorine depends on the amount of chlorine a person is exposed to, how the person was exposed, and the length of time of the exposure. - When chlorine gas comes into contact with moist tissues such as the eyes, throat, and lungs, an acid is produced that can damage these tissues. Immediate signs and symptoms of chlorine exposure During or immediately after exposure to dangerous concentrations of chlorine, the following signs and symptoms may develop: - blurred vision; - burning pain, redness, and blisters on the skin if exposed to gas. Skin injuries similar to frostbite can occur if it is exposed to liquid chlorine; - burning sensation in the nose, throat, and eyes; - coughing; - chest tightness; - difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. These may appear immediately if high concentrations of chlorine gas are inhaled, or they may be delayed if low concentrations of chlorine gas are inhaled; - fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema) that may be delayed for a few hours; - nausea and vomiting; - watery eyes; - wheezing Long-term health effects Long-term complications may occur after breathing in high concentrations of chlorine.

While swine flu and dengue are spreading in the urban areas, the tribal hinterland has been beset with outbreaks of encephalitis since 2012. Though no Japanese encephalitis (JE) mortalities have been registered as yet in the official records, 473 acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) cases have been diagnosed so far. Odisha stands 5th in AES mortality after Uttar Pradesh, Assam, West Bengal and Bihar. According to the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, AES had taken 13 lives by the 1st week of August 2017. Apart from AES, 8 persons have fallen victim to swine flu in Odisha in the last 2 weeks. More than 100 positive cases have been detected. Dengue is the other scourge in the state with 2 deaths and 367 positive cases. Both AES and JE have been regular in Odisha since 2012. Last year, the state grabbed the national headlines when 115 children died of AES and 42 fell to JE. Most of the deaths were reported from Malkangiri district. But the state government has been equivocating on the incidence of AES. It went to the extent of claiming that consumption of seeds of a plant called _Cassia occidentalis_, locally known as Bada Chakunda, caused death of a 3rd of the children who fell to encephalitis in Malkangiri district. An expert committee suggested that JE could not be blamed for all the deaths because \"encephalopathy\" was the culprit. Encephalopathy, it said, is a non-infectious biochemical syndrome that can be aggravated by the consumption of _Cassia_ seeds. The fact is the Naveen Patnaik government remained aloof to the spread of AES, which is caused by a vector-borne virus hosted by pigs. The Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC), Bhubaneswar, carried out a study on the outbreak of AES in Malkangiri in 2015 but its findings were not paid heed to. From 38 deaths in 2012 to 115 in 2016, the AES surge was waiting to happen.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail As of the end of May 2017, there were 313 cases of AES with 10 deaths in Odisha and now the case count is 473 with 13 deaths in the 1st week of August 2017. Odisha state is endemic for Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus, and cases occur there frequently. As with cases of encephalitis mentioned above and in other states in northeastern India, not all encephalitis cases are due to JE virus and are classified as acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) with undetermined etiology. As noted in previous ProMED-mail comments, AES is a term used for multiple etiologies or often when no etiology has been determined. The encephalitis picture in northeastern India is complicated. Although JE virus etiology of some previously reported encephalitis cases has been confirmed by laboratory tests, many cases go undiagnosed, or JE virus infection is ruled out, and other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus (_O. tsutsugamushi_) and lychee fruit consumption, have been proposed.

Given the outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections in the region, and the clinical similarity of cases of that virus infection and CHIKV infection, one wonders how many cases that were not laboratory confirmed but clinically diagnosed as ZIKV infections were, in reality, CHIKV infections. It is also possible that a significant proportion of the population have been infected by CHIKV in the previous 3 years and are now immune. It seems likely, however, that CHIKV is now endemic in the Americas, and sporadic, small outbreaks may continue to occur as they do in Asia and Africa. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"94":{"title":"Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (88): Africa,\r\n\tAsia ","date":["22","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (88): Africa,\r\n\tAsia [EXTERNAL]","summary":" 6 Diarrhea - Nepal (Kapilvastu district)  Sun 20 Aug 2017 Source: The Himalayan Times edited A child has reportedly succumbed to diarrhea in Sattbhara, of Maharajgunj Municipality-7 in Kapilvastu district Province Five on Sun 20 Aug 2017.

The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are: - Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_; - Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam; - Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however, have suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be effective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and outbreak situations (63, 64).<br><br><strong> \"References -</strong><br> 57.

Epidemiologically, usually spread by contaminated food or water, typhoid is not a zoonosis like the commoner types of salmonellosis. Clinically, vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent; indeed, constipation is frequently reported. As it is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive. The symptoms of classical typhoid fever typically include fever, anorexia, lethargy, malaise, dull continuous headache, non-productive cough, vague abdominal pain, and constipation. Despite the often high fever, the pulse is often only slightly elevated. During the 2nd week of the illness, there is protracted fever and mental dullness, classically called coma vigil. Diarrhea may develop but usually does not. Many patients develop hepatosplenomegaly both liver and spleen enlarged. After the 1st week or so, many cases develop a maculopapular rash on the upper abdomen. These lesions (\"rose spots\") are about 2 cm 0.78 in in diameter and blanch on pressure. They persist for 2-4 days and may come and go. Mild and atypical infections are common. The word typhoid (as in typhus-like) reflects the similarity of the louseborne rickettsial disease epidemic typhus and that of typhoid fever; in fact, in some areas, typhoid fever is still referred to as abdominal typhus.

Since 2010, and as of March 2017, the FMDV strain circulating in Nepal has continuously been O/ME-SA/Ind-2001d (in 2015, there was also a single detection of O/ME-SA/PanAsia-2 KAT-15). For the said and additional information on Nepal's FMD past records, including genotyping results (though not yet of the newly introduced A/ASIA/G-VII lineage), see  . The identification of the A/ASIA/G-VII lineage in Nepal represents further spread of this virus, which had been evolving in India many years back (\"A/IND/40/2000\", genotyped A/ASIA/G-VII, was collected in 1999). In 2010, this strain was detected in Myanmar. In 2015, it appeared for the 1st time in the Middle East (\"FMD Pool 3\"), being detected in Saudi Arabia followed, during the same year, by Iran, Turkey and Armenia. Most recently (May 2017), this virus was identified in Northern Israel, on the Lebanese and Syrian borders. According to the information included in the Guest Editor's comments to EuFMD's (European Commission for the control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease) monthly report \"Global Foot-and-Mouth Disease Situation\", June 2017, there were reports of poor performance of vaccine strains derived from the A/ASIA/Iran-05 strain against the A/ASIA/G-VII lineage. The guest editor, Don King (head of the Vesicular Disease Reference Laboratory Group in the Pirbright Institute and WRLFMD), disclosed that WRLFMD, in partnership with the FMD Reference Laboratories in Lelystad (The Netherlands) and Geelong (Australia), has undertaken vaccine potency trials for alternative candidate vaccines; preliminary data indicated that the A-May-97 vaccine may provide protection in cattle, in contrast to the A22 vaccine, which does not appear to induce a protective response. The said data were to \"be presented in more detail shortly\". The said and additional information is available at  . The Indian subcontinent (\"FMD Pool 2\") is the source of 2 FMD strains which have demonstrated, in recent years, a long-distance (trans-regional) transmission, causing losses in \"FMD Pool 3\" countries and threatening Europe.

Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2017; doi:10.4269/ajtmh.<br><br><strong>16-0856; available on line 24 Jul 2017 -</strong><br> Abstract Recurrent outbreaks of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) among children in lychee growing areas in Asia highlight the need to better understand the etiology and the context. We conducted a mixed-methods study to identify risk factors for disease, and behaviors and practices around lychee cultivation in an AES outbreak community in northern Bangladesh in 2012. The outbreak affected 14 children; 13 died. The major symptoms included unconsciousness, convulsion, excessive sweating, and frothy discharge. The median time from illness onset to unconsciousness was 2.5 hours. The outbreak corresponded with lychee harvesting season. Multiple pesticides including some banned in Bangladesh were frequently used in the orchards. Visiting a lychee orchard within 24 hours before onset (age-adjusted odds ratio aOR = 11.6 1.02-109.8) and 3 days (aOR = 7.2 1.4-37.6), and family members working in a lychee orchard (aOR = 7.2 1.7-29.4) and visiting any garden while pesticides were being applied (aOR = 4.9 1.0-19.4) in 3 days preceding illness onset were associated with illness in nearby village analysis. In neighborhood analysis, visiting an orchard that used pesticides (aOR = 8.4 1.4-49.9) within 3 days preceding illness onset was associated with illness. Eating lychees was not associated with illness in the case-control study. The outbreak was linked to lychee orchard exposures where agrochemicals were routinely used, but not to consumption of lychees. Lack of acute specimens was a major limitation. Future studies should target collection of environmental and food samples, acute specimens, and rigorous assessment of community use of pesticides to determine etiology. Discussion The clinical manifestations in case-patients including sudden onset without a prodromal phase, becoming unconscious within a median of 2.5 hours of illness onset, and the short duration between onset of illness to death all suggest that the outbreak was more likely due to a toxic poisoning than an infection. The outbreak was restricted to the lychee season and to a geographic area in which lychees are grown, which suggests that this outbreak of AES may be linked to exposure to lychees or lychee orchards. In India, the leading hypothesis of AES etiology among children living near lychee orchards was the ingestion of phytotoxins, specifically methylenecyclopropylglycine that is present in lychee seeds and pulp, which can lead to hypoglycemia among malnourished children. Without acute biological specimens, and therefore, lack of measured blood glucose levels from children in this outbreak in Bangladesh, we were unable to investigate this hypothesis directly. However, our epidemiologic and clinical findings suggest that methylenecyclopropyl-glycine alone may not explain this AES outbreak among children. There are multiple lines of evidence that agrochemical poisoning may also have contributed. In our study, the signs and symptoms are also consistent with acute pesticide poisoning in children reported in different countries of the world. The outbreak ended following the onset of the monsoon rains, which suggest that the toxin associated with the lychees was on their surface, rather than contained in the fruit. In India, a similar pattern was observed, where the number of cases peaked in mid-June and declined immediately after the onset of monsoon rains. Moreover, the findings of washing fruits and vegetables protective against lychee-associated illness in India further supports our assertion that toxin associated with the lychees may be on the surface. Finally, in India, mortality decline among AES case-patients after rapid correction of hypoglycemia with intravenous dextrose. Although we were unable to measure blood glucose level among the case-patients, however, distribution of blood glucose meter among clinician may help identifying patients with hypoglycemia and rapid correction of hypoglycemia with intravenous glucose may reduce mortality in children in Bangladesh.  communicated by: ProMED-mail The authors indicate that studies based on hospital records and retrospective interviews have significant limitations in confirming the etiology of AES and establishing agrochemical intoxication as the causative factor. One hopes that this study will stimulate prospective studies of AES that will include laboratory supported toxicology confirming exposure to specific, identified agrochemicals, and the clinical details following exposure, including incidence of hypoglycemia, a frequently mentioned condition in AES cases in India.

However the original published report (above) provides additional detail. In the previous report, Mod.TG provided relevant toxicological information that follows. - Mod.TY \"Endosulfan, a commercial product of 2 isomers, is a chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticide. As such, it may be used as wood preservative, but is also a contact poison for many insects and mites. Therefore it has been used on food crops, such as vegetables, grains, fruits and teas to rid these crops of damaging pests. \"Endosulfan is a highly toxic substance whose toxicity is partly dependent upon how the pesticide is applied. The body absorption is rapid in the presence of alcohols, oils or other emulsifiers (on the skin or in the preparation), but otherwise is slowly and incompletely absorbed by the body. \"Generally endosulfan appears to affect the central nervous system. Acute symptoms include incoordination, agitation, convulsion and even loss of consciousness. Other symptoms include vomiting, and diarrhea. In cattle grazing fields sprayed with endosulfan blindness has been documented. Furthermore, these animals may recover when removed from the exposure and given time, perhaps of a month or more. Likewise sheep and pigs grazing on treated fields have been reported with incoordination and blindness. \"Chronic toxicities may affect kidneys, liver, blood chemistry, and the parathyroid gland. There may be other chronic effects such as reproductive effects, teratogenic, mutagenic and/or carcinogenic effects. \"While endosulfans can and do affect a number of body systems chronically, the case of the children in the fruit orchards is an acute case. \"It seems that despite the age of the original case, we at least have an answer regarding the poisoning of the children. - Mod.TG\" ","keywordsMatched":[]},"383":{"title":"Japanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (AS)\r\n\t","date":["31","Jul","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (AS)\r\n\t[EXTERNAL]","summary":"   Thu 3 Aug 2017 02:30 pm Source: Scrol.in edited Ouguri in Assam's Jorhat district, which is part of the Bhogamukh administrative block, has been at the centre of an acute encephalitis syndrome AES outbreak.

Acute encephalitis syndrome is a condition of brain inflammation caused by both bacterial and viral infections and possibly toxicants. It is accompanied by fever, headaches, seizures, disorientation and vomiting in people, and if not treated quickly can result in death. The Japanese encephalitis virus JEV has been responsible for most cases of acute encephalitis syndrome in India and South Asia in many instances, JEV infections have comprised a minor part of AES cases. - Mod.TY The outbreak in Jorhat is part of a larger outbreak in the state. As of Mon 31 Jul 2017, 1404 people in Assam have been diagnosed with acute encephalitis syndrome in Assam this year 2017, 424 among them have tested positive for Japanese encephalitis. About 119 people have died of acute encephalitis syndrome of which 58 had Japanese encephalitis virus infections. In fact, out of the 12 people who were detected to be infected by Japanese encephalitis in Bhogamukh, 11 had been vaccinated. And they are not the only ones. Almost 28 per cent of people in the state who have been infected by Japanese encephalitis had been vaccinated, said Dr Parashee Choudhury, senior medical and health officer at the state's Infectious Disease Surveillance Program. \"There is definitely a problem there too. We need more research to say what exactly is wrong.\" Assam is the only state where children in all its districts are being given the Japanese encephalitis vaccine as routine immunisation, which is part of India's universal immunisation program. The state began administering the vaccine to children for the 1st time in 2006 in Sibsagar district, and has since gradually expanded the coverage to other districts. According to state government data, almost 80 per cent of all children under 15 had been vaccinated as of December, 2016. In 2014, Assam also became the 1st state to administer the Japanese encephalitis vaccine to adults. The adult vaccination programme has covered 18 districts as of now, according to state government data reviewed by Scroll.in. However, the exact number of people vaccinated has yet to be compiled. While there is consensus among doctors that the immunisation intervention has been crucial, most acknowledge that there are gaps in the vaccination system. Those who have received vaccinations should not succumb to infections. However, the government's own data over the years confirms that is not the case. Doctors in the region suspect that the cold chain to transport the vaccines to remote areas may have been compromised at some places. \"By the time, the vaccine reaches a remote village in Sibasagar and Jorhat, where there are practically no roads, it is possible that their efficacy decreases because it is difficult to maintain a cold chain for such a long time,\" said a government doctor who did not want to be identified. The doctor added that the vaccine provided immunity only against Japanese encephalitis. She said: \"There are so many other viruses that can be responsible for acute encephalitis syndrome like the West Nile, but more often and then they don't even get detected and we never get to know what actually caused the symptoms.\" However, Assam's extensive vaccination drive, doctors and public health experts contend, has at least brought down the case fatality rate in patients suffering from Japanese encephalitis. The death toll from Japanese encephalitis, data suggests, has come down marginally since 2014. Ouguri, which is part of the Bhogamukh administrative block, has been at the centre of an acute encephalitis syndrome outbreak. At least 13 cases have been detected in the last 2 months in the block. The Ouguri revenue circle, with 11 villages and a population of slightly more than 10 000, has accounted for almost all of them. Acute encephalitis syndrome is a condition of brain inflammation caused by both bacterial and viral infections and possibly toxicants. It is accompanied by fever, headaches, seizures, disorientation and vomiting in people, and if not treated quickly can result in death. The Japanese encephalitis virus has been responsible for most cases of acute encephalitis syndrome in India and South Asia. There is no specific treatment for Japanese encephalitis, but given the high fatality rate, patients require hospitalisation, supportive care and treatment of symptoms by ensuring rest and administering fluids, pain relievers and medication to reduce fever. While immunisation interventions in the encephalitis endemic districts of Dibrugarh, Jorhat and Sibasagar have helped arrest the spread of the virus to a large extent, most doctors and health workers in the region admit there is a long way to go. The adult vaccination program introduced in 2014, in particular, has suffered many setbacks because of widespread rumours that the Japanese encephalitis vaccine led to impotency. \"This is primarily because there is very little faith in the public health system\", said Suneel Kaul, a public health professional who operates out of rural lower Assam. \"In many tribal areas here, teams that come to administer the vaccine were almost lynched. Any immunisation drive has to be preceded by a lot of communication.\" The failure is evident in areas where the outbreak has been severe. For example, the Baghchung administrative block in Jorhat district, has had 20 acute encephalitis syndrome cases, out of which 15 have been Japanese encephalitis. Five people with Japanese encephalitis and one person with acute encephalitis syndrome not caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus have died - all adults who had never been vaccinated. Areas like Sibasagar, Jorhat and Dibrugarh are vulnerable to Japanese encephalitis due to their geography. \"Just look around the area,\" said Baruah. \"There are all these wetlands, plus so many people breed pigs. And then there are egrets everywhere. The whole area is like a heaven for mosquitoes to breed. No vaccination drive can offset all of these factors.\" Pigs and wild water birds like egrets, which abound in upper Assam, are known to act as hosts to the culex mosquito - the vector that transmits the Japanese encephalitis virus to humans. But while, the animals and birds are hosts for the mosquitoes, stagnant water helps them breed. With geographical peculiarities working against the local population, there is very little in terms of a 2nd line of defense when the vaccination fails to immunise people. Assam's health infrastructure in remote areas is almost non-existent. Disease surveillance can help pre-empt outbreaks but the state surveillance system what does it consist of is also not adequate, claim public health professionals. \"The entire surveillance system has been weak for a while now,\" said a person with an international health non-profit organisation that works closely with the Assam government. \"So, irrespective of vaccination programs, cases of JE will keep emerging from time to time.\" Choudhury of the Infectious Disease Surveillance Program countered claims of the encephalitis surveillance program being not sturdy enough, even as she admitted that the programme did not have enough manpower. \"Every district reports each case of JE to the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme office in Guwahati,\" she explained. \"And if there is a new case in any area with no history, our people go there immediately, collect blood samples, and are always on alert.\" Meanwhile, community health workers have alleged that the government has been complacent about mosquito control measures because the outbreak in 2016 was less severe than the preceding years. In both Baghchung and Bhogamukh  the most severely affected areas in Jorhat  the government did not spray mosquito repellents. Such spraying or fogging is important in areas prone to mosquitoborne infections. \"Whatever fogging has happened has happened after people started dying,\" claimed a health worker. \"By then, the damage was already done. There seems to be a shortage of even DDT this year 2017.\" Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane or DDT is still used as to control mosquitoes in many parts of the country. byline: Arunabh Saikia  communicated by: ProMED-mail Although there are many cases of acue encephalitis syndrome (AES) without an etiological diagnosis, clearly there are many cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) occurring in these areas in Assam state. The reason or reasons for the lack of protection from the vaccine is not clear. The type of vaccine, inactivated or live attenuated, is not stated. Certainly, difficulty in maintaining a cold chain could be an important factor, especially for a live vaccine. The duration of an inactivated vaccine is likely to be relatively short, and require annual boosters. The affected areas in Assam have all the conditions favorable fot JE virus transmission: ardeid birds (herons and their relatives) as reservoirs, pigs as amplifying hosts and wetlands suitable for breeding of culex vector mosquitoes. Vector control over wide-spread wetlands is very difficult and expensive. Use of insecticides over long periods of time is likely to result in resistant mosquito populations. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"403":{"title":"Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (80): Africa,\r\n\tAsia ","date":["31","Jul","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (80): Africa,\r\n\tAsia [EXTERNAL]","summary":" 7 Cholera, imported - South Korea (ex Philippines)  Mon 7 Aug 2017, 9:54 AM Source: Yonhap News edited South Korea has confirmed another case of cholera infection, raising the number of people infected here to 4 in 2017, health authorities said on Mon 7 Aug 2017.

NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea: \"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as \"potentially the most important medical advance\" of the 20th century.

Media reports on cases of the traditionally fearsome glanders, are often published by the Indian press. This is not fully reflected in India's official reports to the OIE. According to the recent ones, the annual numbers of recorded glanders outbreaks (in equidae) countrywide were as follows: 2010 - 1; 2011 - 3; 2012 - 1; 2013 - 1; 2014 - 0; 2015 - 5. During the 1st semester of 2016, 9 outbreaks were reported, involving 45 cases of which 36 died. India's OIE semi-annual report for the period Jul-Dec 2016 is not yet available. No statistics on the incidence of glanders in humans in India could be obtained. Glanders is a contagious and fatal disease of horses, donkeys, and mules, caused by infection with the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_. The pathogen causes nodules and ulcerations in the upper respiratory tract and lungs. A skin form also occurs, known as 'farcy'. Control of glanders requires testing of suspect clinical cases, screening of apparently normal equids, and elimination of reactors. _B. mallei_ can be transmitted to humans, but such cases, which were known to be often fatal, have become rather uncommon (see ref 1). In view of its zoonotic potential, all infected or contaminated (or potentially infected or contaminated) material must be handled in a laboratory with appropriate biosafety and biosecurity controls following a biorisk analysis.

Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world. A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries. Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years. \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\" \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea\". The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years 2 million DALYs since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln 13 million DALYs in the US, and 36-mln 36 million DALYs in Ethiopia. \"Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,\" continues Prof Melegaro \"our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population. Tailoring immunization campaigns to achieve measles eradication goals is essential and currently, for some countries, this means considering also the role of unprotected adolescents and young adults.

Regarding his questions/comments: 1. As I noted in the moderation of the original post, there is a lesser discussed \"window period\" occurring in the incubation period of acute hepatitis B prior to the development of HBsAg and before the development of anti-HBc (IgM and then IgG). The more classical \"window period\" occurs towards the end of acute hepatitis B, whether clinically overt or not, when HBsAg is not longer detectable by standard assays but before anti-HBs is detectable. The only serologic evidence of HBV is anti-HBc and IgM anti-HBc should be positive. HBV DNA is also detectable. It has been shown that blood transfused during this period can be infectious for HBV. 2-4. All good questions which I cannot supply answers to. 5.

According to a previous weekly report from \"Hachaklait\" (Israel's Cooperative Clinical Veterinary Services), in early June 2017 the practitioner attending the dairy operation at Kibutz Neve Ur reported several clinically suspected BEF cases. The said event was confirmed by seroconversion. BEF (\"3 day sickness\") is an insect-transmitted, noncontagious, viral disease of cattle and water buffalo that is seen in Africa, the Middle East, Australia, and Asia. The BEF virus (BEFV) is classified as a member of the genus _Ephemerovirus_ in the family Rhabdoviridae. Signs, which occur suddenly and vary in severity, can include biphasic to polyphasic fever, shivering, inappetence, lacrimation, serous nasal discharge, drooling, increased heart rate, tachypnea or dyspnea, atony of forestomachs, depression, stiffness and lameness, and a sudden decrease in milk yield. Affected cattle may become recumbent and paralyzed from 8 hours to more than 1 week. Morbidity may be high, mortality rate low. BEF causes considerable economical losses in the dairy and beef cattle industries. In Israel, the disease has been reported in previous years from dairy and beef cattle farms in various parts of the country; it is characterised by seasonal pattern related to vector activity. A countrywide BEF epizootic took place in 2014. An evaluation of a BEF vaccine applied in Israel was reported in ref 1. BEF is not zoonotic and is not listed by the OIE. BEF may be currently circulating in other Middle-Eastern countries, sharing the same eastern Mediterranean ecosystem.<br><br><strong> Reference -</strong><br> 1.

This is the 1st detection of KHVD in BC by the CFIA, but the disease has been previously detected in Manitoba and Ontario. The disease detection was associated with an import of koi from Israel by a wholesaler who distributed fish to greenhouses, pet stores and garden centres within BC for sale to private individuals. As a result of this detection, the import of all susceptible species of aquatic animals from Israel for the following end uses will be suspended until further notice: - aquarium - commercial; - aquarium - private; - outdoor holding unit - commercial; and - outdoor holding unit - private. The CFIA is committed to working with Israel to ensure that Canada's aquatic animal health import requirements are met and the suspended zoosanitary export certificate, which applies to all exports from Israel for the aforementioned end uses, can be renegotiated as quickly as possible in order to minimize any impact on trade. KHVD poses no risk to human health or food safety; however, this virus can infect other susceptible species and is reportable under Canada's Reportable Diseases Regulations. Individuals or businesses that are concerned that their fish may have koi herpesvirus disease should contact their local CFIA area and district office immediately. Sick or dead fish should not be disposed of in natural waterways. The disease is transmitted by fish to fish contact and it is also possible that the disease can spread through contaminated water, nets and other equipment.

Measles vaccination coverage is suboptimal in Italy (ranging between 85.4 percent and 90.6 percent for one dose during the period 2007-2016) 1, which has led to large pockets of susceptible adults. We describe an outbreak in an Italian hospital between February and April 2017 among healthcare workers (HCW), hospital support personnel (hospital workers in activities not involving direct contact with patients), hospital visitors and community contacts. This outbreak was part of a wider epidemic in Italy that started in January 2017 and has, as at Sun 30 Jul 2017, led to 4001 cases nationwide (275 in HCW) 2.<br><br><strong> Outbreak description </strong><br> A HCW was referred to the emergency department (ED) of an Italian hospital for a rash developed after taking antibacterials for a mild cough and coryza. The rash was considered an allergic reaction to the antibacterial and the HCW was admitted to the hospital inpatient clinic. Three days later, the HCW's child was admitted to hospital for a rash diagnosed as due to a non-communicable systemic disease. Subsequent serology showed that both the HCW and the child had measles. The origin of the infection for the index case is still unknown. It should be noted, however, that at least 10 community cases of measles occurred in the same period in the area of residence of the HCW. Using the standard case definition of the European Commission 3, a total of 34 measles cases during the following weeks were identified by tracing the contacts of the index case. Among them, 15 were HCWs, 5 were support personnel, 4 were hospital visitors and 11 were community contacts of the above cases. The secondary cases to the index (n = 8) occurred in 2 of the HCW's relatives, in 4 other HCWs, and in 2 support workers who were not immediately recognized as belonging to the hospital outbreak. One of the secondary cases, a HCW, was in service until the onset of symptoms, accessing all rooms on 2 inpatient wards. Tertiary cases (n = 6) involved the family of this HCW, 3 HCWs and a member of support personnel. A total of 2 weeks after the admission of the index case, 2 of the HCWs belonging to tertiary cases presented during the night to the ED where they stayed for nearly 10 hours. An additional 15 cases could be traced following this single exposure window, namely 7 HCWs, 2 support workers, 3 relatives of theirs and 3 visitors to the ED during the time the 2 HCWs were present. One more community case was related to contact outside hospital with one of the tertiary HCW cases. Additional cases were related to a visitor at one of the involved inpatient wards, who probably got in contact with one of the tertiary cases who were HCW during the incubation period and generated 3 cases in the community, among them a family pediatrician. Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the epidemic curve and the outbreak tree for figures, see original URL - Mod.LL.<br><br><strong> Characteristics of cases </strong><br> Up to 6 cases occurred in children up to 9 years of age, while 2 occurred in adolescents between 10 and 17 years and the majority of cases (n = 27) in adults 18 years and older. Figure 3 describes the age distribution among different categories of cases. Vaccination status was known for 24 cases. Sixteen were unvaccinated (2 children, 14 adults), 2 had received one dose, one a full course of 2 doses, and 5 cases occurred in contacts who received one dose of post-exposure vaccination. Of the 5 contacts who received post exposure vaccine, one was an infant younger than one year for whom information about the date of vaccination is not available; for the other 4, the delay between presumed contact date and immunization was 3 days in 2 cases, 6 and 12 days for the remaining 2 cases. Among the HCWs, 2 were vaccinated, 11 were unvaccinated and for 2 of them the data was unavailable. Among the 5 cases belonging to support personnel 2 were unvaccinated and the status was unknown for the remaining 3. Genotyping was available for 3 cases: genotype B3, subtype 3.1 was found in all of them.<br><br><strong> Conclusion and recommendations -</strong><br> Measles elimination in Europe, despite the immunization efforts, is still jeopardized by recurrent outbreaks in susceptible populations 4-7. Nosocomial transmission of measles is an important and emerging way of spreading the infection 8-11. Anyone staying in the hospital environment, regardless of role, can be affected because measles is highly contagious and persists in the environment for up to 2 hours, thus requiring appropriate and timely infection control measures 12,13. Considering that transmission may occur 3 days before the onset of rash, early diagnosis when only non-specific preliminary symptoms (cough, coryza and conjunctivitis) are present is crucial for containing the outbreak 14. A single exposure window, that occurred 2 weeks after the admission of the index case, when 2 cases were present in the ED, resulted in further 15 cases. Appropriate procedures are needed for patients with suspect transmissible infection in the ED, an issue not limited to measles but shared with several other highly infective conditions 13. A 2-dose vaccination is the most effective measure to prevent measles 15. This is of crucial importance for HCWs, with a view to their higher risk of exposure and of transmission to vulnerable patients. However, it should be noted that in at least 5 cases in this outbreak, measles occurred in personnel working in the hospital environment in support functions, highlighting the need to take into consideration the role of such personnel in the spread of the infection. Given that most of the support personnel belong to outsourced services, coordination is needed between occupational health unit and occupational health responsible of outsourced services.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail The full report can be found at the source URL. - Mod.ML There is no doubt that inadequate immunization levels are the major contributor to outbreaks of measles. Most of this is due to not receiving the 2 doses of vaccine due to personal or parenteral choice. Aggressive programs to reverse this unfortunate trend are needed to prevent outbreaks of this potentially lethal disease. The nosocomial setting as reflected in the 3rd post represents a special case situation. It is not clear why health care workers are not required to be immunized for measles. Additionally, when a case of measles is introduced into a health care facility, it has been my experience that the infection is not recognized promptly to minimize nosocomial spread. - Mod.LL   .

The disease has no cure and leaves victims in a fever and with excruciating joint pains as well as headaches, nausea and rashes. There is a death risk of one in a thousand cases. France confirmed 4 cases in 2014 and there was an epidemic in Italy a decade ago. Asian tiger mosquitoes are spreading the disease through the way their eggs and larvae have been exported from native forest haunts in south east Asia in tyre imports. The grubs eggs can survive for months and larvae and pupae develop in small pockets of water retained by tyres. To counter the threat, the authorities are maintaining a \"mosquito surveillance programme\" at 30 UK ports and airports as well as checks at motorway services on routes from south coast ports and Eurotunnel.

Public Health Gibraltar and the Environmental Agency confirmed that the mosquito of the species _Aedes albopictus_, also known as the tiger mosquito, has been found in Gibraltar. Last June 2017 after 9 months of intensive surveillance, officials said no tiger mosquito had been found in Gibraltar. But this has now changed after the 1st tiger mosquito was found in the urban domestic environment within Gibraltar. \"This finding alone does not however materially alter any health risks in Gibraltar and there is no immediate cause for public concern,\" the government said in a statement. Public Health Gibraltar was first alerted in January 2016 to the discovery of the mosquito in Málaga and Algeciras in Andalusia, Spain. Since then, together with the Environmental Agency, it began working with international experts to mount surveillance in Gibraltar. World Health Organization experts visited Gibraltar and gave advice on setting traps and monitoring locations, but no tiger mosquito had been detected until now. The tiger mosquito is not native to Gibraltar and has not been previously found here. It is common in other countries where it transmits viral diseases like Zika, dengue, and chikungunya. It is a domestic species, breeds in water in urban areas  water butts, blocked drains, rainwater gullies  and is able to reach high abundance around residential areas. It is also a day-time mosquito, that aggressively bites humans. \"Health risks to the public only arise if the virus causing these diseases is also present, which is not the case in Gibraltar,\" the government said. \"The virus can, however, be imported by travellers returning from an overseas country and if this happens, there is a risk of spread, but only if the mosquito bites within a small window period of about a week after the fever starts.\" Public Health Gibraltar has been raising awareness of travel risk amongst travellers through its publication A Factsheet for Travellers and recommends the following precautions: - before travelling to affected areas, consult your doctor or seek advice from a travel clinic, especially if you have an immune disorder or severe chronic illness; - if you are pregnant or are considering pregnancy, consider postponing non-essential travel; - when staying in a mosquito-prone area, wear mosquito repellents and take mosquito bite prevention measures; - if you have symptoms within 3 weeks of return from an affected country, contact your doctor; - if you have been diagnosed with any of the diseases Zika, dengue, or chikungunya, take strict mosquito bite prevention measures for 10 days after the fever starts. Now it has been found in Gibraltar. The concerns are real about transmission of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses should populations of _Ae. albopictus_ become established. In 2015 there were a few locally acquired cases of dengue in the south of France. This also happened on a larger scale in Emilia Romagna, Italy, when a viremic man introduced chikungunya virus into Italy and sparked an outbreak.

Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world. A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries. Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years. \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\" \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea\". The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years 2 million DALYs since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln 13 million DALYs in the US, and 36-mln 36 million DALYs in Ethiopia. \"Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,\" continues Prof Melegaro \"our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population. Tailoring immunization campaigns to achieve measles eradication goals is essential and currently, for some countries, this means considering also the role of unprotected adolescents and young adults.

It is important to note puffer fish are highly poisonous and should only prepared by trained, licensed chefs who know one bad cut means almost certain death for a customer. Surprisingly, the meat of some puffer fish is considered a delicacy, especially in Japan. But here's why you should perhaps avoid it completely:  - According to National Geographic, tetrodotoxin is deadly, up to 1200 times more poisonous than cyanide. One puffer fish has enough toxin to kill 30 adults.  - The puffer fish is the 2nd most poisonous vertebrate on the planet. Its poison has no antidote and kills by paralyzing the diaphragm, causing suffocation.  - Almost all puffer fish contain tetrodotoxin, a substance that makes them taste bad (and sometimes lethal) to other fish.  - Tetrodotoxin does not cross the blood-brain barrier, so the victims remain fully conscious while their central nervous system gradually shuts down. Symptoms such as numbness in the mouth, lips, and tongue occur within 30 minutes to 3 hours from an intake and after that, the victim begins to experience headaches, nausea and even vomiting. The rest of the body slowly becomes paralysed, causing death when the heart and lung muscles are also paralysed.  - In Japan, the most lethal part, the liver, cannot be sold, and the whole fish is banned in the European Union.  - There are more than 120 species of puffer fish worldwide. Most of them are found in tropical and subtropical ocean waters. However, some species live in brackish and even fresh water. They have long, tapered bodies with bulbous heads.  - The puffer fish protects itself in the wild by gulping down water and swelling up its belly to make itself look bigger. It does this because, apparently, it can't find a way to communicate the simple message, \"I am poisonous,\" says Byline: Mildred Europa Taylor  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail And Epicore member Addo Michael Brown Tetrodotoxin is a colorless crystal substance that darkens when heated above 400 degrees F or approximately 220 C. Tetrodotoxin is an extremely potent toxin (poison) found mainly in the liver and gonads of some fish, notably puffer fish, or fugu, but also globefish (sometimes puffer fish are also called globefish), and toadfish as well as some amphibians, octopus, and shellfish species. Human poisonings occur when the flesh and/or organs of the fish are improperly prepared and eaten. Tetrodotoxin interferes with the transmission of signals from nerves to muscles and causes an increasing paralysis of the muscles of the body. Tetrodotoxin poisoning can be fatal.

A 5 year old girl is in a critical condition and 2 others are severely ill after eating a supermarket potato salad product infected with _Escherichia coli_ O157, Saitama Prefecture said on Mon 21 Aug 2017. The victims all ate potato salad sold at the Shokusaikan Marche Kagohara supermarket in the city of Kumagaya, Saitama prefecture, the prefecture said. In addition to the girl, who remains unconscious, a 4 year old boy and a 60 year old woman have been hospitalized. All 3 are not expected to be discharged soon. According to Saitama prefecture, the supermarket's deli  Derishasu Kagohara  procured the potato salad from a food-processing factory from outside the prefecture, then mixed cut pieces of ham and apples. The Kumagaya Public Health Center has ordered that the deli be closed for 3 days amid an investigation into the food poisoning, including what caused the _E. coli_ infection and the routes through which the salad was distributed. The incident came to light after the prefecture was notified of a boy being admitted to a Gunma prefecture hospital on 14 Aug 2017. The Kumagaya Public Health Center learned that 8 Saitama residents, who all ate the potato salad sold on 7 and 8 Aug 2017, complained of stomach pains. 3 others ranging in age from 7 to 12 were also hospitalized for symptoms such as diarrhea, but have been released from hospitals already. The 5 year old girl who remains in critical condition has been diagnosed with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a condition caused by an abnormal destruction of red blood cells. Fresh Corp, a Gunma-based supermarket and deli store chain, said no other outlets have reported cases of food poisoning. The firm has apologized for the incident on its website.  communicated by: ProMED-mail It is not clear if the individuals who became ill earlier in the month also suffered from enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ infection. Potato salad seems to be the vehicle for transmission of the infection. Since potatoes are served after cooking, the likely source is not the potatoes themselves but rather an ingredient added to the food. Pork products are not common carriers of EHEC but this has been reported (E. coli EHEC - Canada (04): (AB) O157, pork products, recall http://promedmail.org/post/20140909.2759887). Apples can carry EHEC especially if harvested after falling from the tree and outbreaks have occurred from unpasteurized apple juice or cider (E. coli EHEC - USA (19): (CA) O111, unpasteurized apple juice, alert, recall http://promedmail.org/post/20151107.3774944; E. coli, toxigenic, apple cider - USA (Oklahoma) http://promedmail.org/post/19991019.1857). It is also possible that cross contamination during preparation from other foods could have occurred related to poor kitchen hygiene. ProMED-mail would like more information regarding this outbreak. It may be recalled by ProMED-mail readers and evident from the flurry of ProMED-mail postings from Japan in 1996 and 1997 shown below that substantially more cases of this disease occurred in that time frame.

Epidemiological investigations revealed that the sources of infection in these 16 outbreaks included school lunches served at elementary schools and child care centers (9 outbreaks, 9845 patients), nursing home meals (3 outbreaks, 123 patients), a meal served at an industrial facility (1 outbreak, 47 patients), a commercially prepared box lunch (1 outbreak, 191 patients), and unknown sources (2 outbreaks, 58 patients).

Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world. A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries. Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years. \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\" \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea\". The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years 2 million DALYs since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln 13 million DALYs in the US, and 36-mln 36 million DALYs in Ethiopia. \"Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,\" continues Prof Melegaro \"our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population. Tailoring immunization campaigns to achieve measles eradication goals is essential and currently, for some countries, this means considering also the role of unprotected adolescents and young adults.

Compensation to the animals' owners for dead cattle at the market price is being developed and will be implemented soon. All 459 diseased cattle heads were destroyed and the final disinfection was carried out. 2. The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted. Follow-up report no.12, with links to all previous reports, is available at  . Although according to media reports vaccination was applied, no details of such were included in the 12 follow-up reports nor in Kazakhstan's semi-annual summary report to the OIE (July-December 2016), which included the epidemiological statistics above; the item \"control measures\" (against LSD) did not include \"vaccination\". The current media report, from a Kyrgyz source (citing a Kazakh newspaper), says that during the 2016 event, 6000 animals were infected, of which 600 died. An earlier media report, from Kazakhstan, dated 27 Jul 2016, said that the number of diseased animals \"exceeded 2000, of which 50 head of cattle died\" (see archive no. http://promedmail.org/post/20160727.4374008). Kazakhstan is the world's largest landlocked country, and the 9th largest in the world. The belated diagnosis in 2016, and its continued absence, so far, during the current event, is puzzling; following the acquiring of independence in Dec 1991, Kazakhstan obtained support from the West, particularly USA, in the establishment of state-of-the-art laboratories for research and diagnosis of infectious diseases in man and animals. Early report on the factual circulation and distribution of LSD within Kazakhstan is anticipated. Neighboring countries may take steps to prevent its introduction; those countries include China, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. Russia is LSD-infected (last follow-up report addressing 2 new outbreaks in Saratov oblast, adjacent to West Kazakhstan, published 24 Aug 2017). For the diagnosis of LSD, samples from clinically affected animals should preferably be derived from their typical dermal lesions; organs from dead animals which should be sent for laboratory tests are specified in OIE's Manual. The submission of \"meat of dead cows\" for testing in the laboratories, as reported, may not be ideal for timely diagnosis of LSD. - Mod.AS   .

ProMED-mail is very grateful to the submitter of the information above, addressing 4 issues raised in earlier postings on LSD in Kazakhstan. The following comments address the issues as numbered above: 1. Additional details (link?) of the mentioned official confirmation, by Kazakhstan's authorities, of the current (2017) LSD event will be helpful. The internationally customary (in fact, required) route for such an announcement is an immediate notification to the OIE. 2. The LSD vaccine applied in Russia (and exported) is, in fact, a sheep-pox vaccine which, following a testing procedure, was recently licensed also for the vaccination of cattle against LSD (see http://promedmail.org/post/20170511.5028821). The Kenyan O-240 vaccine has been recently found to include an LSD virus which underwent a low level of attenuation which may be not sufficient for safe use in cattle. It was suspected to cause clinical disease in vaccinated animals (see in http://promedmail.org/post/20140820.2708273). EU countries currently use a live-homologous LSD vaccine (South-Africa's Neetling virus strain). A European Union LSD vaccine bank has become operational since April 2016. Trials assessing an inactivated vaccine were reportedly undertaken, currently in their final stages. For a recent assessment of LSD vaccines, please see http://promedmail.org/post/20160812.4410864, including the commentary. OIE's Manual chapter on LSD, including exhaustive updated information, is available at  . 3. This comment is of high significance. Small-holders, worldwide, may be slow, or even tempted to refrain altogether from reporting the appearance of early signs of a reportable animal disease, if they expect compensations to be under the real damages and payments delayed. Such animals may be (illegally) sold, with consequent spread of disease and  eventually  higher national losses and expenditures. 4. The original text, in Kazakh and Russian, is available in Kazakhstan's Ministry of Agriculture blog, at  . In case the recent media reports on LSD spreading in Western Kazakhstan are confirmed, it will be of interest to note if the affected farms included vaccinated animals and which vaccines were used. Kazakhstan's official reporting on the 2016 LSD event was limited to a solitary notification on a single outbreak; no details of the vaccination (numbers and vaccinated animals, geography) were included. According to the recent official update, LSD was recorded, during 2016, in 4 locations within the Atyrau oblast. Timely and detailed information on the LSD situation in Kazakhstan is essential for the entire region. This applies also for another livestock disease suspected to be spreading in central Asia, namely PPR (peste des petits ruminants) in small ruminants. - Mod. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Kenya":{"403":{"title":"Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (80): Africa,\r\n\tAsia ","date":["31","Jul","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (80): Africa,\r\n\tAsia [EXTERNAL]","summary":" 7 Cholera, imported - South Korea (ex Philippines)  Mon 7 Aug 2017, 9:54 AM Source: Yonhap News edited South Korea has confirmed another case of cholera infection, raising the number of people infected here to 4 in 2017, health authorities said on Mon 7 Aug 2017.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea: \"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per cent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as \"potentially the most important medical advance\" of the 20th century.

Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world. A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries. Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years. \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\" \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea\". The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years 2 million DALYs since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln 13 million DALYs in the US, and 36-mln 36 million DALYs in Ethiopia. \"Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,\" continues Prof Melegaro \"our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population. Tailoring immunization campaigns to achieve measles eradication goals is essential and currently, for some countries, this means considering also the role of unprotected adolescents and young adults.

While it is recommended that children get 2 doses of MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine, starting with the 1st dose at 12 through 15 months of age, and the 2nd dose at 4 through 6 years of age, this study emphasizes that it is important that adolescents and young adults also are up to date on their MMR vaccination. - Mod.LK ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Kiribati":{},"Kosovo":{},"Kuwait":{},"Kyrgyzstan":{"489":{"title":"Lumpy skin disease, bovine - Kazakhstan (02): (WK) spread susp,\r\n\tRFI ","date":["24","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH> Lumpy skin disease, bovine - Kazakhstan (02): (WK) spread susp,\r\n\tRFI [EXTERNAL]","summary":"   Sun 20 Aug 2017 Source: Kloop (Kyrgyzstan) in Russian, machine trans., edited At least 120 head of cattle have been killed in the Atyrau region West Kazakhstan; the cause of the death of the animals is unknown.

Please see relevant commentary in the subsequent postings no. http://promedmail.org/post/20160722.4362368 and http://promedmail.org/post/20160723.4365082). On 7 Jul 2016, Kazakhstan reported (see archive no. http://promedmail.org/post/20160722. According to the report, the susceptible population was 3557 head including 459 clinical cases of which 34 died, the 425 remaining sick animals \"killed and disposed of\". No stamping out applied and no additional case reported in the 12 follow-up reports, the last of which, no.12, submitted on 26 Nov 2017, stated: 1. Compensation to the animals' owners for dead cattle at the market price is being developed and will be implemented soon. All 459 diseased cattle heads were destroyed and the final disinfection was carried out. 2. The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted. Follow-up report no.12, with links to all previous reports, is available at  . Although according to media reports vaccination was applied, no details of such were included in the 12 follow-up reports nor in Kazakhstan's semi-annual summary report to the OIE (July-December 2016), which included the epidemiological statistics above; the item \"control measures\" (against LSD) did not include \"vaccination\". The current media report, from a Kyrgyz source (citing a Kazakh newspaper), says that during the 2016 event, 6000 animals were infected, of which 600 died. An earlier media report, from Kazakhstan, dated 27 Jul 2016, said that the number of diseased animals \"exceeded 2000, of which 50 head of cattle died\" (see archive no. http://promedmail.org/post/20160727.4374008). Kazakhstan is the world's largest landlocked country, and the 9th largest in the world. The belated diagnosis in 2016, and its continued absence, so far, during the current event, is puzzling; following the acquiring of independence in Dec 1991, Kazakhstan obtained support from the West, particularly USA, in the establishment of state-of-the-art laboratories for research and diagnosis of infectious diseases in man and animals. Early report on the factual circulation and distribution of LSD within Kazakhstan is anticipated. Neighboring countries may take steps to prevent its introduction; those countries include China, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. Russia is LSD-infected (last follow-up report addressing 2 new outbreaks in Saratov oblast, adjacent to West Kazakhstan, published 24 Aug 2017). For the diagnosis of LSD, samples from clinically affected animals should preferably be derived from their typical dermal lesions; organs from dead animals which should be sent for laboratory tests are specified in OIE's Manual. The submission of \"meat of dead cows\" for testing in the laboratories, as reported, may not be ideal for timely diagnosis of LSD. - Mod.AS   .

According to the media, \"The Philippines will cull 200 000 chickens, quail and ducks after confirming the country's 1st outbreak of bird flu,\" Agriculture Secretary Emmanuel Pinol said on Friday 4 Aug 2017?. The avian flu outbreak was detected in a farm in San Luis municipality in Pampanga province, north of the capital Manila, which later spread to 5 neighbouring farms. There has been no case of human transmission, although health officials are conducting checks on farm workers. \"We have declared a one-km quarantine radius with the epicenter being San Luis. All fowl found within the area will be culled and buried, and the estimated population is 200 000,\" Pinol told reporters at a news conference. The volume of birds to be culled was half of Pinol's initial estimate of 400 000, which he said was based on a preliminary evaluation and was later revised after inspection. The government's report on Friday 4 Aug 2017? to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) described the flu virus in affected birds as an H5 subtype of highly pathogenic (high-path) avian influenza. Initial tests ruled out high-path H5N1 as the virus strain, Dr. Celia Carlos told reporters, and samples will be sent to Australia for further testing. \"The Department of Health is doing surveillance of possible human cases, especially concentrating on people who have been exposed to the affected animals or poultry,\" Carlos said. Culling should be completed within the next 3 days, said Pinol. The virus may have come from migratory birds from China or smuggled ducks, also from China, he said. There were indications as early as April 2017 of bird flu hitting one farm, but the situation worsened in July 2017, with around 37 000 birds dying during the period, Pinol said. The Philippines is the latest country in Asia, Europe and Africa where the bird flu viruses have spread in recent months. Many strains only infect birds, but the H7N9 strain has led to human cases, including fatalities, in China\". See  .

The total number of cVDPV2 cases this year 2017 remains 7, in 2 separate outbreaks: in Haut Lomami province (5 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on 13 Jun 2017); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on 26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017, with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May 2017). - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time. Outbreak response is taking place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols, targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 across the 2 provinces. - The 1st mOPV2 round was implemented on 27-29 Jun 2017 in the 2 affected provinces; and the 2nd mOPV2 round ran from 13-15 Jul 2017 in Haut Lomami and 20-22 Jul 2017 in Maniema. - Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.<br><br><strong> Middle East -</strong><br> - In Syria, 3 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were officially reported in the past week. The total number of cases in this outbreak is 33. Onset of paralysis of these cases is between 3 Mar 2017 and 10 Jul 2017. 31 of the cases are from Deir ez-Zor governorate (29 from Mayadeen district, one from Deir ez-Zor district, and one from Boukamal district); 1 case is from Talabyad district, Raqqa governorate; and, 1 is from Tadmour district in Homs governorate. - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized and implemented, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Two vaccination campaigns are planned for both Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa governorates. If there is geographic spread, the extent of these campaigns will have to be adjusted. - The 1st mOPV2 round in Deir ez-Zor was successfully carried out between 22-26 Jul 2017. Independent post-campaign monitoring reflected coverage of 88.4 percent (based on caregiver recall). The 2nd round is planned for 19-23 Aug 2017, and will include mOPV2 and IPV. - Raqqa Governorate started mOPV2 campaigns on 12 Aug 2017. - Plans are being finalized to mitigate the risks of further spread from the outbreak zone to neighbouring areas and countries, including immunization of at-risk populations in northwest Syria, Turkey and Lebanon. Following confirmation of the case in Homs, discussions are ongoing to further extend the geographic reach of the outbreak response.<br><br><strong> Officially reported wild poliovirus cases as of 15 Aug 2017 - Total global cases in 2017: 9 (compared with 21 for the same period in 2016) Total in endemic countries in 2017: 9 (compared with 21 for the same period in 2016) - Afghanistan: 6 cases in 2017 (compared with 6 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 10 Jul 2017 - Pakistan: 3 cases in 2017 (compared with 13 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 11 Jun 2017 - Nigeria: 0 cases in 2017 (compared with 2 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 21 Aug 2016 Total in non-endemic countries in 2017: 0 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016) Total global cases in 2016: 37 - Total in endemic countries: 37 - Total in non-endemic countries: 0 Officially reported cVDPV cases as of 15 Aug 2017 -</strong><br> Total global cases in 2017: 40 (compared with 3 for the same period in 2016) - Syrian Arab Republic: 33 cases in 2017 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 10 Jul 2017 - Democratic Republic of the Congo: 7 cases in 2017 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 13 Jun 2017 - Pakistan: 0 cases in 2017 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 17 Dec 2016 - Nigeria: 0 cases in 2017 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 28 Oct 2016 - Lao People's Democratic Republic: 0 case in 2017 (compared with 3 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 11 Jan 2016 Total global cases in 2016: 5 - Total in endemic countries: 2 - Total in non-endemic countries: 3  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail This week's global update is similar to prior weeks in terms of low level identification of WPV1 associated disease (a single case confirmed in Afghanistan this past week), one positive WPV1 isolated from an environmental sample in Pakistan, and 3 newly confirmed cVDPV2 associated cases in Syria. That being said, there have only been 9 confirmed cases of WPV1 associated paralytic disease worldwide this year (2017), compared with 37 cases reported last year (2016). In contrast there have been 40 confirmed cases of cVDPV2 confirmed this year (2017) compared with 5 last year (2016). As a reminder, outbreaks due to cVDPV's are considered as significant in the big picture of polio eradication, as they are due to vaccine polioviruses that have reverted in neurovirulence following passage through multiple individuals while circulating in the susceptible population. The goal of the polio eradication initiative is to interrupt transmission of both the WPV's and the cVDPVs. The presence of cVDPVs occurs when there are areas with low vaccination coverage where the vaccine virus (from the OPV) can continue circulating through the susceptible population. - Mod.MPP ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Lesotho":{},"Liberia":{},"Libya":{},"Liechtenstein":{},"Lithuania":{},"Luxembourg":{"444":{"title":"Fipronil contamination - table eggs: (02) France,\r\n\tNetherlands, Belgium, Germany, recall ","date":["11","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH/EDR> Fipronil contamination - table eggs: (02) France,\r\n\tNetherlands, Belgium, Germany, recall [EXTERNAL]","summary":"   Wed 9 Aug 2017 16:35 CEST Source: Ouest-France in French trans. Corr.SB, edited In the midst of the health scandal of the eggs contaminated with fipronil coming from the Netherlands, the prefecture capital, Arras of Pas-de-Calais confirms analyses carried out in a French farm. All eggs laid on the farm since 28 Jul 2017 will be destroyed. In parallel, the northern prefecture confirmed today 9 Aug 2017 that a processor of egg products based in Roncq (Nord department) received a delivery of batches of contaminated eggs. New investigations are underway. The prefecture of Pas-de-Calais confirmed this Wed 9 Aug 2017 the presence of fipronil in a chicken farm with laying hens in the department. It is the 1st French farm in which traces of this insecticide, which caused the crisis of contaminated eggs that originated in the Netherlands, have been found. At the same time, the prefecture of the Nord department Lille also confirmed that a processing company the department is also involved: a processor of egg products based in Roncq was supplied with batches of contaminated eggs. According to the Pas-de-Calais prefecture, cited by 20 Minutes, the risk of contamination of the chickens has been linked to the use, by the operator, of a pest control product, DEGA-16, containing the banned substance. The site manager warned the authorities one of his suppliers was using DEGA-16, reports La Voix du Nord. Indeed, Chickfriend, the Belgian distributor of the product, illegally added fipronil to the composition of its antiparasitic drug, intended to eradicate the red louse. Pending the results of the analyzes, the eggs from this farm had been previously set aside and their sale suspended as a precaution, on 28 Jul 2017. As the results confirmed the presence of fipronil, these eggs will all be destroyed. As for the manufacturing company located in Roncq, the northern prefecture provides details this Wed 9 Aug 2017 on its site  ; in French. It said that it had been informed on 8 Aug 2017 that the processor of egg products, Ovoservices, had also \"shipped batches of contaminated eggs.\" The authorities have told our colleagues that the company \"immediately put in place the recall measures for destruction of the eggs so that they could not be sold to its customers.\" \"At the same time, the Departmental Directorate of Populations is conducting an investigation in each farm in the eggs sector of the department to ensure that the DEGA 16 has not been used,\" said the Nord prefecture. The investigations should make it possible to check \"the possible diffusion\" of the products from this plant, on French and European territories. This likely means the distribution of products from this plant. - Mod.TG Faced with the growing crisis, professionals in the sector are reassuring. Xavier Garenaux, president of the Licques Volaille poultry Defense Union of (Pas-de-Calais), reminds us that chickens intended for slaughter are killed too young to know about a possible treatment against the red louse. Most farmed chickens live only 35 to 40 days (81 days for Label Rouge chickens). Only the eggs, resulting from the farming of laying hens, would therefore be potentially affected by this health scandal.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. The WHO has set a very low level of fipronil in the eggs. While this article does not tell us the level of fipronil in the eggs, it is believed to be above the admissible limits. Without regard to the amount of fipronil in the eggs, it is possible there are happy chickens as they are no longer facing mites. - With current fipronil levels, Germany's Federal Institute for Risk Assessment estimates a child who weighs around 16 kg (35 lb) could eat 1.7 eggs per day without reaching the threshold where fipronil levels become dangerous. This includes products that contain egg, like pancakes or pasta. An adult who weights 65 kg (143 lb) could eat 7 eggs a day. The levels currently measured in contaminated eggs aren't very high and thus not dangerous for adults, however authorities and experts have advised parents to not let their children eat contaminated eggs ( ). Additionally, according to the UK Food Standards Agency ( ): \"Our risk assessment, based on all the information available, indicates that as part of a normal healthy diet this low level of potential exposure is unlikely to be a risk to public health and there is no need for consumers to be concerned. Our advice is that there is no need for people to change the way they consume or cook eggs or products containing eggs.\" So while fipronil is not approved for use in food producing animals, the agencies monitoring this situation have a risk assessment in place indicating the risk is low to consumers, but nevertheless are acting out of caution to protect them. - Mod.TG In addition to the detection of fipronil-contaminated eggs in France reported above, such findings have now been reported from several other European countries, including Romania, Sweden, Switzerland, Luxembourg, and the UK. One ton of contaminated egg yolk liquid was uncovered in Romania later on Thu 10 Aug 2017, according to the country's veterinary health authority ANSVSA. It was the 1st discovery of contaminated egg product in eastern Europe since the scandal erupted. The egg yolk liquid was found in a warehouse on the western side of the country and had been imported from Germany, but \"none of the product has been offered for sale,\" said ANSVSA. British authorities reported earlier on Thu 10 Aug 2017 that around 700 000 eggs from affected Dutch farms had been distributed in Britain. The UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) said the eggs were mixed in large batches to be used in processed foods and not sold fresh, as they were in countries like the Netherlands and Germany. 4 major British grocery chains have withdrawn such products, including sandwiches and salads, the FSA said in a statement. \"However, as this represents 0.007 per cent of the eggs we consume in the UK every year, it remains the case that it is very unlikely that there is any risk to public health from consuming these foods,\" the statement said. The FSA also said that the recalls were not being carried out owing to safety concerns, but because the ingredient is not authorized for use. Luxembourg said that eggs sold in the discount supermarket Aldi had been withdrawn after one batch was found to contain sufficient levels of fipronil to potentially pose a threat to young children, who cannot consume as much as adults safely. Aldi earlier this month August 2017 pulled all Dutch eggs from its stores in Germany, but the company said on Thu 10 Aug 2017 that its German markets would restock eggs as of Fri 11 Aug 2017. Police in the Netherlands have detained 2 men suspected of being involved in the illegal use of fipronil. Millions of fipronil-contaminated eggs have been recalled since the scandal broke.

The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are: - Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_; - Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam; - Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however, have suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be effective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and outbreak situations (63, 64).<br><br><strong> \"References -</strong><br> 57.

The Malaysian state of Sarawak has declared parts of three divisions to be &ldquo;rabies infectious areas.&rdquo; Five human rabies cases and almost 800 cases of people being bitten by rabid animals have been reported in Serian, Sri Aman, and Kutching divisions as of July 2017. All five people infected with rabies have died.  Public health officials are responding by treating people bitten by local dogs or cats for rabies exposure and advising the public on how to prevent the spread of the disease.  What is rabies?  Rabies is a deadly disease caused by a virus that is spread in the saliva of infected animals. All mammals can get rabies. People usually get rabies from licks, bites, or scratches from infected dogs or other animals such as bats, foxes, raccoons, and mongooses.  Rabies affects the central nervous system, ultimately causing brain disease and death. Once symptoms of rabies appear, the disease is nearly always fatal, so prevention is especially important.  What can travelers do to prevent rabies?  Get a rabies vaccine before travel, if recommended.  Talk to your doctor about your travel plans. If your activities will bring you into contact with animals such as dogs, cats, bats, or other carnivores, you should consider pre-exposure rabies vaccination, which is a 3-shot series (days 0, 7, and 21 or 28) given before travel.  Even if you get the pre-exposure rabies vaccine, you should still get immediate medical treatment if you are bitten or scratched by an animal during travel.  See Vaccine Information Statement for more information.  Avoid animal bites during travel:  Avoid touching all animals, including wild animals and pets. Pets in other countries, such as Malaysia, may not be vaccinated against rabies.  Supervise children closely, especially around dogs, cats, and wildlife such as monkeys and bats.  If you are traveling with your pet, supervise your pet closely, and do not allow it to play with local animals, including local pets, and especially avoid stray animals.  Avoid bringing animals home to the United States. Dogs and cats may be infected with rabies but not show signs until several days or months later. There are also rules and regulations for bringing animals and animal products into the United States.  For more information, see Be Safe Around Animals .  Consider medical evacuation insurance:  Rabies can be treated with a post-exposure vaccine, but the series of shots must be started as soon as possible after animal exposure. This type of vaccination is not available in all parts of the world, so consider buying medical evacuation insurance.  Medical evacuation insurance may cover the cost to transfer you to the nearest destination where complete care can be obtained. Some policies may cover your eventual return to your home country. For more information, see Insurance .  Act quickly if an animal bites or scratches you.  Wash the wound well with soap and water.  See a healthcare provider right away, even if you don&rsquo;t feel sick or your wound does not look serious. To prevent rabies, you may need to start a series of vaccinations immediately.  To get vaccinated, be prepared to travel back to the United States or to another area. This type of vaccination is not available in all parts of the world, so consider buying insurance that covers the cost of travel to a country that can give you the care you need.  For more information, see Insurance .  For more information about medical care abroad, see Getting Health Care Abroad and a list of Joint Commission International-accredited facilities.  After you return home, tell your healthcare provider or state health department that you were bitten or scratched during travel and about any treatment you received overseas.  If possible, give a copy of your overseas medical record to your US healthcare provider.

Zika virus (or Zika) has been reported in Maldives. Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in Maldives are infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:  Women who are pregnant:  Do not travel to Maldives.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to Maldives or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers considering pregnancy:  Before you or your partner travel, talk to your health care provider about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection.  Wait before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.

Travelers considering pregnancy  Talk to your health care provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you&rsquo;re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Wait at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  Men are advised to wait longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.gov  Contact CDC  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  1600 Clifton Road  Atlanta ,  GA  30329-4027  USA  800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)  Contact CDC-INFO  TOP","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Mali":{},"Malta":{"2":{"title":"Brucellosis - USA (05): (TX) human, unpasteurized milk,\r\n\talert ","date":["14","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH/EDR> Brucellosis - USA (05): (TX) human, unpasteurized milk,\r\n\talert [EXTERNAL]","summary":"<br><br><strong>   Mon 14 Aug 2017 Source: Texas Department of State Health Services edited Health Alert - Brucellosis Contracted from Consumption of Raw Milk -</strong><br> Raw milk is milk from cows or other animals that has not been pasteurized to kill harmful bacteria. This raw, unpasteurized milk can carry dangerous bacteria such as _Brucella_, _Listeria_, _Salmonella_, _E. coli_, and _Campylobacter_, which are responsible for causing numerous foodborne illnesses and outbreaks. The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) recommends that people drink and eat only pasteurized dairy products (including soft cheese, ice cream, and yogurt). Pasteurization is the process of heating milk to a high enough temperature for a long enough time to kill dangerous bacteria. This is especially important for people at higher risk for foodborne illness: children younger than 5, pregnant women, adults 65 and older, and people with weakened immune systems. However, healthy people of any age can get very sick or even die if they drink raw milk contaminated with harmful germs.<br><br><strong> Brucellosis </strong><br> Brucellosis is an infectious disease caused by bacteria. It is a reportable condition in Texas. People can get the disease when they are in contact with infected animals or animal products, including raw milk, contaminated with the bacteria. Animals that are most commonly infected include sheep, cattle, goats, and pigs, among others. Initial symptoms can include fever, sweats, malaise, anorexia, headache, pain in muscles, joint, and/or back, and fatigue. Some signs and symptoms may persist for longer periods of time. Others may never go away or reoccur. These can include recurrent fevers, arthritis, swelling of the testicle and scrotum area, inflammation of the heart (endocarditis), neurologic symptoms (in up to 5% of all cases), chronic fatigue, depression, and swelling of the liver and spleen. Brucellosis in pregnancy is associated with risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as premature delivery, miscarriage, and intrauterine infection with fetal death. Neonatal infection may occur through transplacental transmission during a maternal bacteremic phase, from exposure to blood, urine, or vaginal secretions during delivery, or through breastfeeding. Laboratory diagnosis of brucellosis involves testing to look for bacteria in samples of blood, bone marrow, or other body fluids. Treatment consists of combination antibacterial therapy. Depending on the timing of treatment and severity of illness, recovery may take a few weeks to several months. Death from brucellosis is rare, occurring in no more than 2% of all cases.<br><br><strong> Brucellosis Case Investigation </strong><br> In the course of diagnosing the cause of fever, muscle and joint pain, and fatigue in a Texas resident, blood culture results revealed that the patient was infected with _Brucella_. Through investigation by DSHS, the most probable source of the infection was determined to be raw cow's milk, which the person had been consuming. The source of the milk was K-Bar Dairy, a licensed raw milk dairy in Paradise, Texas. DSHS is concerned that other people who consumed raw milk from K-Bar Dairy may also have been exposed to _Brucella_ and became infected. Brucellosis may cause short-term and long-term disease. Without specific testing, this disease may elude correct diagnosis, and without appropriate antibiotic therapy, illness may persist.<br><br><strong> Recommended Action </strong><br> Health care providers should consider brucellosis among differential diagnoses when a patient presents with a clinically-compatible constellation of signs and symptoms. The patient should be asked about risk factors for brucellosis. A key question affecting the level of suspicion of brucellosis in this scenario is the patient's consumption of raw milk or raw milk products from K-Bar Dairy in Paradise Texas in Wise County since 1 Jun 2017. These individuals are considered to be at high risk of contracting brucellosis. Consumers are advised not to consume any raw milk or raw milk products from K-Bar Dairy that are still in their possession and to discard them. At this time, it is uncertain how long _Brucella_ may have been present in the raw milk from this dairy. Testing is ongoing in an attempt to answer that question. If a patient seeks consultation because they consumed raw milk or raw milk products from this dairy between January and June 2017, they should be advised to be watchful for signs of chronic brucellosis and clinically evaluated as appropriate. As a healthcare professional, we ask you to familiarize yourself with brucellosis, since it is an uncommon infection and can present with a wide variety of non-specific symptoms and signs that can wax and wane over weeks or even months. For these reasons, brucellosis presents a diagnostic challenge that requires the clinician to become familiar with the risk factors (e.g., potential exposure), signs, symptoms, natural history, available diagnostic tests, and treatment options. CDC has indicated that laboratory testing for this strain of _Brucella_ relies upon polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to establish timely presumptive results and recovery via blood culture for _Brucella_ species confirmation. The strain of _Brucella_ recovered from the index patient in this case is resistant to rifampin and penicillin. The CDC is one reliable source for current information on _Brucella_: .

Emerg Microbes Infect. 2017; 6(8): e69. doi: 10.1038/emi.2017.<br><br><strong>59  Abstract </strong><br> Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has recently been associated with an increased incidence of neonatal microcephaly and other neurological disorders. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito bite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some cases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main vector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other mosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the virus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit ZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of laboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. Interestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the midgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in Recife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially fed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx. quinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced. Collectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range of ZIKV vectors than anticipated.  <br><br>Communicated by: Roland Hübner Superior Health Council Brussels Belgium Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active virus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their ability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step toward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_ fed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in saliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing. The study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a competent vector. Several other studies have shown this species to be inefficient vectors or refractory to Zika virus infection. One wonders if the specific _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ used or the Zika virus isolates with which they were tested could account for these very different results. Resolving these discrepancies is important because this mosquito species is very widely distributed around the world and bears directly on risk of outbreaks in geographic areas where _Aedes aegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_ , Zika virus vectors, do not occur. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"123":{"title":["Zika Virus in Marshall Islands"],"date":["08","August","2017"],"url":"wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/alert/zika-virus-marshall-islands","summary":" Magill Partners GeoSentinel Global TravEpiNet Mobile Apps RSS Feeds  Zika Virus in Marshall Islands  Recommend on Facebook  Tweet  Share Compartir  Warning - Level 3, Avoid Nonessential Travel  Alert - Level 2, Practice Enhanced Precautions  Watch - Level 1, Practice Usual Precautions  Language:  Select  Espa&ntilde;ol  What is the current situation?  Zika virus (or Zika) has been reported in the Marshall Islands. Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in the Marshall Islands are infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:  Women who are pregnant:  Do not travel to the Marshall Islands.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to the Marshall Islands or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers considering pregnancy:  Before you or your partner travel, talk to your health care provider about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection.  Wait before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.  If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex &ndash; or do not have sex &ndash; for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More Zika information for pregnant women  2.

Multiple candidate Zika vaccines have been shown protective against infection with the virus in animal studies, with several now in human trials, but none were tested in the context of pregnancy, according to the authors of the study published in Cell  . The 2 vaccine candidates investigated in the new study are the 1st to demonstrate efficacy in preventing vertical transmission of the virus and related fetal death in an animal model. Although the vaccines were administered to female mice prior to pregnancy, the result is considered an important step toward developing a vaccine that could be safely given to pregnant women. One of the 2 candidates is a modified messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine encoding Zika genes, developed by the biotechnology company Moderna. It is already in safety trials in women who are not pregnant. The other is a live-attenuated Zika strain developed by researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). The testing was carried out by scientists from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Washington University School of Medicine, and UTMB. The researchers 1st vaccinated the mice with 1 of the vaccines or a placebo. After mating, the animals were challenged with the virus 6 days into pregnancy. A week later, more than 50 percent of placentas and fetuses from mice administered the mRNA vaccine had virtually no Zika RNA. The remainder had \"substantially lower\" levels relative to placebo. The live vaccine provided broader protection: 78 percent of placentas and 83 percent of fetuses had Zika RNA at or below the level of detection, while the placebo group exhibited significantly higher levels of placental and fetal Zika RNA. Mice vaccinated with either vaccine had significantly higher rates of fetal viability; whereas 100 percent of fetuses from mice vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine were born, none survived to term in the placebo group.

In May 2017, health officials reported 2 imported cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in Senegal imported from Mauritania. A 3rd imported case was reported in June 2017. He developed headache, muscle and joints pains and diarrhea on 20 Aug 2017 and sought medical attention. He was treated with anti-malarial medicines and analgesics. After 2 days, he returned for medical care as his condition worsened. He was tested for CCHF because of bleeding manifestations and was IgM positive for Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The patient is still hospitalized and in stable clinical condition. Mauritania experienced a fairly large CCHF outbreak in 2003, involving 38 cases with a case fatality rate of 28.6 percent. According to the WHO, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is a widespread disease caused by a tick-borne virus (Nairovirus) of the Bunyaviridae family. The CCHF virus causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 percent. CCHF is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and Asian countries south of the 50th parallel north, the geographical limit of the principal tick vector. The hosts of the CCHF virus include a wide range of wild and domestic animals such as cattle, sheep and goats. Animals become infected by the bite of infected ticks, and the virus remains in their bloodstream for about one week after infection, allowing the tick-animal-tick cycle to continue when another tick bites. Although a number of tick genera are capable of becoming infected with CCHF virus, ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_ are the principal vectors. The CCHF virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians. Human-to-human transmission is possible.

In the period from February to August 2003, 38 persons were infected with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus; 35 of these persons were residents of Nouakchott. The 1st patient was a young woman who became ill shortly after butchering a goat. She transmitted the infection to 15 persons in the hospital where she was admitted and 4 members of her family. In Nouakchott, 2 disease clusters and 11 isolated cases were identified. Of the patients not infected by the 1st case-patient, almost half were butchers, which suggests that the primary mode of animal-to-human transmission was direct contact with blood of infected animals. Cattle heavily infested with ticks were more likely to be CCHFV seropositive, and vector control to reduce the tick burden can result in reduced seroprevalence. Cattle are noted as the most sensitive indicator of low-level CCHFV circulation because they tend to be highly infested with _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks, which are the most common vectors of CCHF  . The circulation of CCHF virus and the high prevalence of infected animals and ticks have been well documented in Mauritanian farming areas since 1983 Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever and Rift Valley fever in south-eastern Mauritania.

Part of the problem is that the anthracnose isn't being detected until it's too late. \"In Florida USA, we pick mango with great ripeness,\" says a Florida mango grower. \"But in Mexico, they have to pick it almost green and they don't see the anthracnose until it gets ripe. So when they come through everything looks fine, but at the stores, there have been a lot of complaints.\" Byline: Astrid van den Broek  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail Anthracnose is considered the most important disease of mango. It is caused by the fungi _Colletotrichum gloeosporioides_ (synonym _Glomerella cingulata_) or _C. acutatum_. Symptoms may include flower blight, pre- and post-harvest fruit rot, twig dieback, and leaf spots. Anthracnose can completely destroy the flowers and cause extensive dead areas on leaves, greatly reducing yield. The fungi apparently invade the skin of young fruit and remain in a latent state until fruit ripening begins. Ripe fruit, either before or after picking, can then develop prominent dark-brown to black spots. Fruit infection commonly occurs and can result in extensive rotting. The fungi have a long saprophytic survival ability on dead twigs and fallen leaves. These are the main sources of inoculum and spread may occur with infected plant material, by mechanical means (including insect activities) and water splash. The disease is favoured by humid conditions during the period from the onset of flowering until fruit are about half size. Control of anthracnose in mango usually centers on a diligent fungicide programme, but may also include phytosanitation to reduce inoculum, as well as cultural measures to reduce moisture in the orchard. More Indo-Chinese/Philippine type mango varieties show levels of resistance to anthracnose than Indian type varieties.

Zika virus replication in the mosquito _Culex quinquefasciatus_ in Brazil. Emerg Microbes Infect. 2017; 6(8): e69. doi: 10.1038/emi.2017.<br><br><strong>59  Abstract </strong><br> Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has recently been associated with an increased incidence of neonatal microcephaly and other neurological disorders. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito bite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some cases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main vector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other mosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the virus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit ZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of laboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. Interestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the midgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in Recife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially fed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx. quinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced. Collectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range of ZIKV vectors than anticipated.  <br><br>Communicated by: Roland Hübner Superior Health Council Brussels Belgium Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active virus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their ability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step toward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_ fed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in saliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing. The study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a competent vector. Several other studies have shown this species to be inefficient vectors or refractory to Zika virus infection. One wonders if the specific _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ used or the Zika virus isolates with which they were tested could account for these very different results. Resolving these discrepancies is important because this mosquito species is very widely distributed around the world and bears directly on risk of outbreaks in geographic areas where _Aedes aegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_ , Zika virus vectors, do not occur. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"91":{"title":"Chikungunya (27) - Americas, Europe, Asia ","date":["18","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Chikungunya (27) - Americas, Europe, Asia [EXTERNAL]","summary":"<br><br><strong> Cases in various countries: Regional summaries - Americas -</strong><br> WHO/PAHO report 18 Aug 2017 Reported cases of chikungunya fever in the Americas, by country or territory - 2017 to EW 33 week ending 18 Aug 2017.

TY  communicated by: ProMED-mail and Roland Hübner Superior Health Council Brussels Belgium The number of reported cases of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection in the Americas appears to have declined this year (2017). Given the outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections in the region, and the clinical similarity of cases of that virus infection and CHIKV infection, one wonders how many cases that were not laboratory confirmed but clinically diagnosed as ZIKV infections were, in reality, CHIKV infections. It is also possible that a significant proportion of the population have been infected by CHIKV in the previous 3 years and are now immune. It seems likely, however, that CHIKV is now endemic in the Americas, and sporadic, small outbreaks may continue to occur as they do in Asia and Africa. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"95":{"title":"Brucellosis - Mexico (02): (ZA) ","date":["22","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH/EDR> Brucellosis - Mexico (02): (ZA) [EXTERNAL]","summary":"   Tue 22 Aug 2017 Source: El Sol de Zacatecas in Spanish, machine trans., edited The Ministry of Health of Zacatecas, through Health Jurisdiction Number IV, confirmed that up to now there have been 19 cases of brucellosis, the pertinent measures have been taken, and those affected are being taken care of.

It was not until 1887 that a British physician, Dr David Bruce, isolated the organism that causes brucellosis from several deceased patients from the island of Malta. This disease has had several names throughout its history, including Mediterranean fever, Malta fever, Crimean fever, Bang's disease, and undulant fever (because of the relapsing nature of the fever associated with the disease). See  . The symptoms and signs of brucellosis may develop from days to months after the initial exposure to the organism. While some individuals may develop mild symptoms, others may go on to develop long-term chronic symptoms. The signs and symptoms of brucellosis are extensive, and they can be similar to many other febrile illnesses, so recognition of potential exposure from ingestion of unpasteurized milk or cheese, working in a slaughter house or meat processing plant, or working in a microbiology lab is critical information when evaluating a case.

The purpose of this HAN Health Alert Network Advisory is to notify public health departments and healthcare facilities and to provide guidance to healthcare providers of the increase in reported cases. Please disseminate this information to healthcare providers in hospitals and emergency rooms, to primary care providers, and to microbiology laboratories. Healthcare providers should consider a diagnosis of cyclosporiasis in patients with prolonged or remitting-relapsing diarrheal illness. Testing for _Cyclospora_ is not routinely done in most US laboratories, even when stool is tested for parasites. Healthcare providers must specifically order testing for _Cyclospora_, whether testing is requested by ova and parasite (O&P) examination, by molecular methods, or by a gastrointestinal pathogen panel test. Cyclosporiasis is a nationally notifiable disease; healthcare providers should report suspect and confirmed cases of infection to public health authorities.<br><br><strong> Background </strong><br> Cyclosporiasis is an intestinal illness caused by the parasite _Cyclospora cayetanensis_. People can become infected with _Cyclospora_ by consuming food or water contaminated with the parasite; it is not transmitted directly from one person to another person. The most common symptom of cyclosporiasis is watery diarrhea, which can be profuse. Other common symptoms include anorexia, fatigue, weight loss, nausea, flatulence, abdominal cramping, and myalgia; vomiting and low-grade fever may also occur. Symptoms of cyclosporiasis begin an average of 7 days (range: 2 days to 2 weeks or longer) after ingestion of the parasite. If untreated, the illness may last for a few days to a month or longer, and may have a remitting-relapsing course. The treatment of choice for cyclosporiasis is trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). No effective alternative treatments have yet been identified for persons who are allergic to or cannot tolerate TMP/SMX, thus observation and symptomatic care is recommended for these patients. Cyclosporiasis occurs in many countries but is more common in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Previous outbreaks in the United States have been linked to various types of imported fresh produce (such as, basil, cilantro, mesclun lettuce, raspberries, and snow peas). To date, no commercially frozen or canned produce has been implicated. In the United States, most of the reported cases and outbreaks have occurred during the spring and summer months, especially during May through August or September. As of 2 Aug 2017, 206 cases of _Cyclospora_ infections have been reported to CDC in persons who became infected in the United States and became ill on or after 1 May 2017. These cases have been reported from 27 states, most of which have reported relatively few cases. 18 cases reported hospitalization; no deaths have been reported. At this time, no specific vehicle of interest has been identified, and investigations to identify a potential source of infection are ongoing. It is too early to say whether cases of _Cyclospora_ infection in different states are related to each other and/or to the same food item(s). The number of cases (206) reported in 2017, is higher than the number of cases reported by this date in 2016. As of 3 Aug 2016, 88 _Cyclospora_ infections had been reported in persons who became infected in the United States and became ill on or after 1 May 2016.<br><br><strong> Recommendations for healthcare providers </strong><br> - Consider a diagnosis of cyclosporiasis in patients who have prolonged or remitting-relapsing diarrheal illness. - If indicated, healthcare providers should specifically order testing for _Cyclospora_, whether testing is requested by ova and parasite (O&P) examination, by molecular methods, or by a gastrointestinal pathogen panel test. Several stool specimens may be required because _Cyclospora_ oocysts may be shed intermittently and at low levels, even in persons with profuse diarrhea. - Report cases to local health departments.

Vaccines protect fetus from Zika. JAMA. 2017; 318(8): 689. doi:10.1001/jama.2017.<br><br><strong>11200 </strong><br> Researchers funded in part by the National Institutes of Health have recently demonstrated that 2 experimental vaccines can restrict transmission of Zika virus from pregnant mice to their fetuses, thereby shielding offspring from congenital damage or death. Multiple candidate Zika vaccines have been shown protective against infection with the virus in animal studies, with several now in human trials, but none were tested in the context of pregnancy, according to the authors of the study published in Cell  . The 2 vaccine candidates investigated in the new study are the 1st to demonstrate efficacy in preventing vertical transmission of the virus and related fetal death in an animal model. Although the vaccines were administered to female mice prior to pregnancy, the result is considered an important step toward developing a vaccine that could be safely given to pregnant women. One of the 2 candidates is a modified messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine encoding Zika genes, developed by the biotechnology company Moderna. It is already in safety trials in women who are not pregnant. The other is a live-attenuated Zika strain developed by researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). The testing was carried out by scientists from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Washington University School of Medicine, and UTMB. The researchers 1st vaccinated the mice with 1 of the vaccines or a placebo. After mating, the animals were challenged with the virus 6 days into pregnancy. A week later, more than 50 percent of placentas and fetuses from mice administered the mRNA vaccine had virtually no Zika RNA. The remainder had \"substantially lower\" levels relative to placebo. The live vaccine provided broader protection: 78 percent of placentas and 83 percent of fetuses had Zika RNA at or below the level of detection, while the placebo group exhibited significantly higher levels of placental and fetal Zika RNA. Mice vaccinated with either vaccine had significantly higher rates of fetal viability; whereas 100 percent of fetuses from mice vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine were born, none survived to term in the placebo group. A working group funded by the Wellcome Trust recently approved ethical guidelines for testing such vaccines in pregnant women, normally excluded from drug trials.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\.

Zika virus (or Zika) has been reported in Micronesia. Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in Micronesia are infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:  Women who are pregnant:  Do not travel to Micronesia.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to Micronesia or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers considering pregnancy:  Before you or your partner travel, talk to your health care provider about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection.  Wait before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.  If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex &ndash; or do not have sex &ndash; for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More Zika information for pregnant women  2.

Travelers considering pregnancy  Talk to your health care provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you&rsquo;re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Wait at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive.

In recent years, animal epidemics and regional epidemics have led to significant economic losses. The increasing number of infectious diseases every year and the emergence of new diseases are a challenge for us to improve the prevention and control of the disease and to reduce the risk of structured and preventive measures before the diagnosis of infectious diseases. It impedes barriers to international trade and closes the export of livestock and their raw products and negatively affects the income and livelihoods of herders and the country, aimag provinces and soum districts economies. The final decision on the implementation of Phase 2 of the Mongolian Livestock Early Warning System was approved by the Prime Minister of Mongolia J. Erdenebat at the 21st International Economic Forum held in St. Petersburg, Russia. In June 2017, Minister of Agriculture and Light Industry P. Sergelen and Minister of Agriculture of the Russian Federation A.N. Tkakaev signed an agreement to supply 4 million doses of vaccine to Mongolia. The 1st consignment, including 1 300 700 doses of the A&O vaccine has been received today (31 Jul 2017). Initial vaccination is planned to address sensitive and vulnerable animals in central and eastern regions in suspected and protected areas. In the future, the supply of remaining vaccines to Mongolia will be jointly organized by the Federation of Animal Health Protection and the Implementing Agency of the Veterinary and Breeding Agency of the government.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. The above media report includes pictures of Russian-sourced vaccine vials. The label on the vial, in Russian, provides the following information: FMD vaccine, bivalent, serotypes A and O. Dosage: For large animals (cattle, buffalo, camels, yak, pig) - 2 cc. For sheep, goats - 1 cc. The vial contains 100 doses for (the mentioned) large animals or 200 doses for small ruminants. Mongolia reported to the OIE a new FMD outbreak, on its eastern region, on 13 Feb 2017. According to the report, the outbreak had started on 24 Jan 2017 and was confirmed on 28 Jan 2017, the causative agent being serotype O. One of the control measures undertaken was \"Vaccination in response to the outbreak,\" addressing cattle, sheep and goats. No information on the manufacturer of the vaccine used or on the vaccine strain included in the applied vaccine, became available. This may have been a different manufacturer, namely not the (current) Russian one. Genotyping of the January 2017 strain from Mongolia was carried out at Pirbright (WRLFMD), indicating that the causative agent in 2017 was serotype O, topotype ME-SA, lineage \"PanAsia\" (see, including a dendogram and most closely related prototype sequences, at  ). Clearly, as apparent from the recent media reports, FMD has widely spread in Mongolia, from the east westwards and northwards. The following information on Mongolia's FMD situation was published in page 7 of EUFMD's Global Monthly report for June 2017, available at  : \"FMDV serotypes A and O were detected in 10 of the 16 samples collected between March 2015 and April 2017, of which one was from a sheep and the remaining from cattle. \"Genotyping of the VP1 of the detected viruses identified the following lineages: A/ASIA/SEA-97, and O/SEA/Mya-98, and O/ME-SA/PanAsia.

It is not clear whether the vaccination applied during the 1st half of 2017 has conferred protection. The last follow-up report (No. 2) on FMD in Mongolia was submitted to the OIE on 27 Apr 2017, when the accumulated number of outbreaks was 16.

The person may also have nausea, vomiting, a sore throat and mood swings. Byline: Nomhle Kangootui  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever transmitted by ticks. It can be responsible for severe outbreaks in humans, but it is not pathogenic for ruminants, their amplifying hosts. Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) spreads to humans either by tick-bites or through contact with viraemic animal tissues during and immediately post-slaughter. CCHF outbreaks constitute a threat for public health services because of epidemic potential, high case fatality ratios (10-40 percent), potential for nosocomial outbreaks, and difficulties in treatment and prevention. CCHF is endemic in all of Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and in Asia south of the 50th parallel north, the geographic limit of the genus _Hyalomma_, the principal tick vector  . It is difficult to prevent or control CCHF infection in animals and ticks as the tick-animal-tick cycle usually goes unnoticed and the infection in domestic animals is usually not apparent. Furthermore, the tick vectors are numerous and widespread, so tick control with acaricides (chemicals intended to kill ticks) is only a realistic option for well-managed livestock production facilities. There are no vaccines available for use in animals. Although an inactivated, mouse brain-derived vaccine against CCHF has been developed and used on a small scale in eastern Europe, there is currently no safe and effective vaccine widely available for human use. In the absence of a vaccine, the only way to reduce infection in people is by raising awareness of the risk factors and educating people about the measures they can take to reduce exposure to the virus. Health-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed CCHF, or handling specimens from them, should implement standard infection control precautions. These include basic hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment, safe injection practices and safe burial practices. As a precautionary measure, health-care workers caring for patients immediately outside the CCHF outbreak area should also implement standard infection control precautions. Samples taken from people with suspected CCHF should be handled by trained staff working in suitably equipped laboratories. Recommendations for infection control while providing care to patients with suspected or confirmed Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever should follow those developed by WHO for Ebola and Marburg haemorrhagic fever. - Mod.UBA   .

ProMED-mail thanks Dr Sher Bahadur Pun for continued contributions to ProMED-mail on scrub typhus in Nepal. Scrub typhus is caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a rickettsia-like microorganism that is transmitted by chiggers, the larval stage of trombiculid mites, which feed on the skin cells of animals, including humans and rodents. After feeding on their hosts, chiggers drop to the ground and become nymphs, which then mature into adults that feed only on plant materials. The cutaneous reaction to chiggers leaves a characteristic black eschar that is useful for making the diagnosis. Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the infected chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation.

TY  communicated by: ProMED-mail and Roland Hübner Superior Health Council Brussels Belgium The number of reported cases of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection in the Americas appears to have declined this year (2017). Given the outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections in the region, and the clinical similarity of cases of that virus infection and CHIKV infection, one wonders how many cases that were not laboratory confirmed but clinically diagnosed as ZIKV infections were, in reality, CHIKV infections. It is also possible that a significant proportion of the population have been infected by CHIKV in the previous 3 years and are now immune. It seems likely, however, that CHIKV is now endemic in the Americas, and sporadic, small outbreaks may continue to occur as they do in Asia and Africa. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"94":{"title":"Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (88): Africa,\r\n\tAsia ","date":["22","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (88): Africa,\r\n\tAsia [EXTERNAL]","summary":" 6 Diarrhea - Nepal (Kapilvastu district)  Sun 20 Aug 2017 Source: The Himalayan Times edited A child has reportedly succumbed to diarrhea in Sattbhara, of Maharajgunj Municipality-7 in Kapilvastu district Province Five on Sun 20 Aug 2017.

The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are: - Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_; - Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam; - Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however, have suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be effective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and outbreak situations (63, 64).<br><br><strong> \"References -</strong><br> 57.

Since 2010, and as of March 2017, the FMDV strain circulating in Nepal has continuously been O/ME-SA/Ind-2001d (in 2015, there was also a single detection of O/ME-SA/PanAsia-2 KAT-15). For the said and additional information on Nepal's FMD past records, including genotyping results (though not yet of the newly introduced A/ASIA/G-VII lineage), see  . The identification of the A/ASIA/G-VII lineage in Nepal represents further spread of this virus, which had been evolving in India many years back (\"A/IND/40/2000\", genotyped A/ASIA/G-VII, was collected in 1999). In 2010, this strain was detected in Myanmar. In 2015, it appeared for the 1st time in the Middle East (\"FMD Pool 3\"), being detected in Saudi Arabia followed, during the same year, by Iran, Turkey and Armenia. Most recently (May 2017), this virus was identified in Northern Israel, on the Lebanese and Syrian borders. According to the information included in the Guest Editor's comments to EuFMD's (European Commission for the control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease) monthly report \"Global Foot-and-Mouth Disease Situation\", June 2017, there were reports of poor performance of vaccine strains derived from the A/ASIA/Iran-05 strain against the A/ASIA/G-VII lineage. The guest editor, Don King (head of the Vesicular Disease Reference Laboratory Group in the Pirbright Institute and WRLFMD), disclosed that WRLFMD, in partnership with the FMD Reference Laboratories in Lelystad (The Netherlands) and Geelong (Australia), has undertaken vaccine potency trials for alternative candidate vaccines; preliminary data indicated that the A-May-97 vaccine may provide protection in cattle, in contrast to the A22 vaccine, which does not appear to induce a protective response. The said data were to \"be presented in more detail shortly\". The said and additional information is available at  . The Indian subcontinent (\"FMD Pool 2\") is the source of 2 FMD strains which have demonstrated, in recent years, a long-distance (trans-regional) transmission, causing losses in \"FMD Pool 3\" countries and threatening Europe. These are FMDV serotype O, topotype ME-SA, strain Ind-2001d and FMDV serotype A, topotype Asia, genotype (strain) VII. While the routes of dissemination are yet to be clarified, the FMD situation within India, a major beef exporter, including its vaccination policy and vaccines efficacy, deserves being visited. - Mod.AS   .

Majority of these patients are being treated in different hospitals in Kathmandu. 9 children with laboratory confirmed ST received treatment at STIDH and recovered uneventfully. It is quite surprising for me observing such a large number of ST cases being detected in Kathmandu, the biggest and most densely populated area of Nepal. Because ST has previously been almost exclusively detected in rural areas of Nepal. What is not yet clear is the impact of ST between the years 2004 and 2015. ST was first well documented in 2004 in Kathmandu (1), while the significant number of ST cases has only been detected since 2015. The widespread use of antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin, could be one possible explanation. In other words, healthcare workers in Nepal usually view any fever as typhoid fever, thus used to treat febrile patients with ciprofloxacin, which might have also worked simultaneously against ST too. However, nowadays, cefixime has become the drug of choice for typhoid fever, and it may, however, not work effectively against ST, resulting in emergence of ST in Nepal.<br><br><strong> Reference -</strong><br> 1.

Doxycycline is the drug of choice and it is preferred over other tetracyclines for treatment of scrub typhus; it is rarely associated with staining of teeth in children younger than 8 years (1). Macrolides, such as azithromycin, are also reported to be efficacious (2). Fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, have been reported to be clinically effective in the treatment of scrub typhus in a few patients. However, some clinical studies suggest that fluoroquinolones are not as effective in patients with scrub typhus as other antibiotics (3,4). In vitro testing of some strains of _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, the cause of scrub typhus, has been reported to show resistance to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin (minimum inhibitory concentration=8 micrograms/mL) (5) and mutation in the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) of the gyrA gene associated with fluoroquinolone resistance has been found (3,5).

Ministers and food safety chiefs from around the European Union are set to meet on Tue 6 Sep 2017 in a bid to get countries to stop \"blaming and shaming\" each other over the scare involving the chemical fipronil. Millions of eggs have been pulled from supermarket shelves across Europe and dozens of poultry farms closed since the discovery of fipronil, which can harm human health, was made public on 1 Aug 2017. The issue has sparked a row between Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, the 3 countries at the epicentre of the crisis, about how long they knew about the problem. \"Blaming and shaming will bring us nowhere and I want to stop this,\" Vytenis Andriukaitis, the European Commissioner for health and food safety, told AFP as he announced the meeting. \"We need to work together to draw the necessary lessons and move forward instead.\" European Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said that \"this is not, let's be clear, a crisis meeting\" and it is being held next month September 2017 to get \"distance to the events\". Fipronil is commonly used to get rid of fleas, lice and ticks from animals but is banned by the European Union from use in the food industry. The EU insists there is no threat to human health, but the World Health Organization (WHO) says that when eaten in large quantities it can harm people's kidneys, liver and thyroid glands. Brussels said the 15 affected EU countries were Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Sweden, Britain, Austria, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Denmark, along with non-EU Switzerland. But in a sign the crisis is going global, Brussels also announced that Hong Kong had received some tainted eggs from the Netherlands, with the southern Chinese city becoming the 1st place in Asia known to be affected. As well as dealing with the immediate food safety issue, the EU is also seeking to calm tempers over the egg row after a series of divisive crises in the bloc in recent years, from Brexit to migration. Belgium earlier this week week of Mon 6 Aug 2017 accused the Netherlands of knowing about the fipronil eggs since November 2016 and failing to notify other countries. On Thu 10 Aug 2017 Dutch Health Minister Edith Schippers admitted the government had made \"errors\" but denied a cover-up. \"We were well aware of a report of the presence of fipronil in the pens of egg-laying hens in November 2016, but there was no indication at the time that fipronil itself was found in the eggs,\" said Schippers. A Dutch whistleblower separately said he had told the authorities that Chickfriend, the Dutch company at the centre of the scandal, was illegally using fipronil in the treatment of lice in chicken pens in The Netherlands. \"I am the anonymous whistleblower,\" Nick Hermens told the NPO public broadcaster. A Belgian company, Poultry Vision, has said it provided Chickfriend with the chemical. Dutch and Belgian investigators carried out coordinated raids on several premises on Thu 10 Aug 2017, arresting 2 people at Chickfriend. However, Belgium itself has been forced to admit that it knew about fipronil in eggs back in June 2017 but kept it secret for nearly 2 months because of a criminal investigation. Fresh discoveries of contaminated eggs have continued daily. Denmark said on Fri 11 Aug 2017 it had found 2 tonnes of fipronil-tainted scrambled eggs, bringing the total of contaminated eggs to 22 tonnes, mainly from Belgium. Poland said it had discovered about 40 000 eggs imported from Germany. French Agriculture Minister Stephane Travert said that since April 2017 the country had sold nearly 250 000 contaminated eggs, imported from Belgium and the Netherlands, but the risk for consumers was \"very low\" given French eating habits. The food scare is one of the biggest to hit Europe since the 2013 horsemeat scandal when equine meat was falsely labelled and mis-sold. Previous food scandals include contamination of chickens and eggs by dioxin in 1999, which began in Belgium, and mad-cow disease via cattle feed contaminated by the ground-up carcasses of animals infected with a deadly brain disorder - which ran from roughly 1986 to 1998 and started in Britain.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\.

Corr.SB, edited In the midst of the health scandal of the eggs contaminated with fipronil coming from the Netherlands, the prefecture capital, Arras of Pas-de-Calais confirms analyses carried out in a French farm. All eggs laid on the farm since 28 Jul 2017 will be destroyed. In parallel, the northern prefecture confirmed today 9 Aug 2017 that a processor of egg products based in Roncq (Nord department) received a delivery of batches of contaminated eggs. New investigations are underway. The prefecture of Pas-de-Calais confirmed this Wed 9 Aug 2017 the presence of fipronil in a chicken farm with laying hens in the department. It is the 1st French farm in which traces of this insecticide, which caused the crisis of contaminated eggs that originated in the Netherlands, have been found. At the same time, the prefecture of the Nord department Lille also confirmed that a processing company the department is also involved: a processor of egg products based in Roncq was supplied with batches of contaminated eggs. According to the Pas-de-Calais prefecture, cited by 20 Minutes, the risk of contamination of the chickens has been linked to the use, by the operator, of a pest control product, DEGA-16, containing the banned substance. The site manager warned the authorities one of his suppliers was using DEGA-16, reports La Voix du Nord. Indeed, Chickfriend, the Belgian distributor of the product, illegally added fipronil to the composition of its antiparasitic drug, intended to eradicate the red louse. Pending the results of the analyzes, the eggs from this farm had been previously set aside and their sale suspended as a precaution, on 28 Jul 2017. As the results confirmed the presence of fipronil, these eggs will all be destroyed. As for the manufacturing company located in Roncq, the northern prefecture provides details this Wed 9 Aug 2017 on its site  ; in French. It said that it had been informed on 8 Aug 2017 that the processor of egg products, Ovoservices, had also \"shipped batches of contaminated eggs.\" The authorities have told our colleagues that the company \"immediately put in place the recall measures for destruction of the eggs so that they could not be sold to its customers.\" \"At the same time, the Departmental Directorate of Populations is conducting an investigation in each farm in the eggs sector of the department to ensure that the DEGA 16 has not been used,\" said the Nord prefecture. The investigations should make it possible to check \"the possible diffusion\" of the products from this plant, on French and European territories. This likely means the distribution of products from this plant. - Mod.TG Faced with the growing crisis, professionals in the sector are reassuring. Xavier Garenaux, president of the Licques Volaille poultry Defense Union of (Pas-de-Calais), reminds us that chickens intended for slaughter are killed too young to know about a possible treatment against the red louse. Most farmed chickens live only 35 to 40 days (81 days for Label Rouge chickens). Only the eggs, resulting from the farming of laying hens, would therefore be potentially affected by this health scandal.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. The WHO has set a very low level of fipronil in the eggs. While this article does not tell us the level of fipronil in the eggs, it is believed to be above the admissible limits. Without regard to the amount of fipronil in the eggs, it is possible there are happy chickens as they are no longer facing mites. - With current fipronil levels, Germany's Federal Institute for Risk Assessment estimates a child who weighs around 16 kg (35 lb) could eat 1.7 eggs per day without reaching the threshold where fipronil levels become dangerous. This includes products that contain egg, like pancakes or pasta. An adult who weights 65 kg (143 lb) could eat 7 eggs a day. The levels currently measured in contaminated eggs aren't very high and thus not dangerous for adults, however authorities and experts have advised parents to not let their children eat contaminated eggs ( ). Additionally, according to the UK Food Standards Agency ( ): \"Our risk assessment, based on all the information available, indicates that as part of a normal healthy diet this low level of potential exposure is unlikely to be a risk to public health and there is no need for consumers to be concerned. Our advice is that there is no need for people to change the way they consume or cook eggs or products containing eggs.\" So while fipronil is not approved for use in food producing animals, the agencies monitoring this situation have a risk assessment in place indicating the risk is low to consumers, but nevertheless are acting out of caution to protect them. - Mod.TG In addition to the detection of fipronil-contaminated eggs in France reported above, such findings have now been reported from several other European countries, including Romania, Sweden, Switzerland, Luxembourg, and the UK. One ton of contaminated egg yolk liquid was uncovered in Romania later on Thu 10 Aug 2017, according to the country's veterinary health authority ANSVSA. It was the 1st discovery of contaminated egg product in eastern Europe since the scandal erupted. The egg yolk liquid was found in a warehouse on the western side of the country and had been imported from Germany, but \"none of the product has been offered for sale,\" said ANSVSA. British authorities reported earlier on Thu 10 Aug 2017 that around 700 000 eggs from affected Dutch farms had been distributed in Britain. The UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) said the eggs were mixed in large batches to be used in processed foods and not sold fresh, as they were in countries like the Netherlands and Germany. 4 major British grocery chains have withdrawn such products, including sandwiches and salads, the FSA said in a statement. \"However, as this represents 0.007 per cent of the eggs we consume in the UK every year, it remains the case that it is very unlikely that there is any risk to public health from consuming these foods,\" the statement said. The FSA also said that the recalls were not being carried out owing to safety concerns, but because the ingredient is not authorized for use. Luxembourg said that eggs sold in the discount supermarket Aldi had been withdrawn after one batch was found to contain sufficient levels of fipronil to potentially pose a threat to young children, who cannot consume as much as adults safely. Aldi earlier this month August 2017 pulled all Dutch eggs from its stores in Germany, but the company said on Thu 10 Aug 2017 that its German markets would restock eggs as of Fri 11 Aug 2017. Police in the Netherlands have detained 2 men suspected of being involved in the illegal use of fipronil. Millions of fipronil-contaminated eggs have been recalled since the scandal broke.

Even more troubling, the virus seems to be circulating among displaced populations who frequently uproot and migrate, making it that much harder to contain. Following a recent visit to northeast Nigeria, Dr Philippa Easterbrook, a senior scientist for the WHO's global hepatitis program, spoke to Devex about a recently-developed WHO response plan created to reduce the number of new cases of the virus and provide training to local health workers as a means of improving case management and diagnosis. This water-borne infection was 1st reported in August 2016 in Chad's Samalat region, to the country's southeast. As of July 2017, the country had reported more than 1600 suspected or confirmed cases, and 18 deaths. The virus then surfaced in neighboring Niger in January 2017, in the Diffa region, an area near the Chad and Nigeria borders. Hepatitis E cases here spiked dramatically in mid-April 2017, and decreased before then increasing again. Now approximately 1450 people are suspected to have been infected, more than half of those women, with 38 fatalities. With the frequent movement of internally displaced populations, the infection eventually arrived in Nigeria in May 2017, in Damasak, a town near the Niger border, and has since seen 696 cases total, mostly at the Ngala internally displaced people's camp, near the Cameroon border in Borno state. Currently, all cases of hepatitis E in the Lake Chad region have been among displaced persons and refugees, Easterbrook explained. \"This led us to the working hypothesis that these outbreaks are all linked and related to large population movements,\" she said. Without immediate attention, humanitarians are concerned that the virus could spread even further within impacted countries and even into unaffected areas, such as neighboring Cameroon or the Central African Republic. Even more so, this outbreak is highlighting the unsanitary water conditions affecting those impacted by conflict in the Lake Chad Basin. Hepatitis E is most dangerous in pregnant women, and has an incubation period of 2 to 10 weeks where the infection remains asymptomatic and undetected in most people. Usually symptoms include flu-like symptoms such as: Low-grade fever, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and most notably jaundice. Because the virus carries symptoms also seen in hepatitis A, yellow fever and malaria cases, diagnosing patients and managing cases can be a challenge. Roughly 5 percent of cases develop more serious complications, according to Easterbrook, however the biggest risk is developing acute liver failure, or in pregnant women, post-partum hemorrhaging which can be fatal. The most pressing agenda in the response plan is the improvement of water and sanitation hygiene in the region. As the virus spreads via contaminated water, Easterbrook cited that the improvement of WASH conditions would not only support the reduction in new hepatitis E cases, but could also reduce the prevalence of other infectious diseases, namely hepatitis A, cholera, and typhoid. To date, roughly 200 restrooms and 100 showers have been constructed in Ngala camp. WHO has also worked with local partners to rehabilitate water points and distribute hygiene kits, which include items such as sanitary napkins and water purification tablets, to women and households. However, cultural barriers impede the progress of these initiatives. \"Some people would rather have low-level restroom facilities rather than walk some distance to a more modernized latrine,\" Easterbrook explained.

Genotypes 3 and 4 are zoonotic, with swine being a major reservoir, and tend to be seen in the developed world. Type 3 in particular can cause chronic infection, especially in the immunocompromised host. - Mod.LL   .

As noted in earlier comments, Lassa fever remains a problem in Nigeria because the virus is endemic there. Virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or their excreta. Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients.

That being said, there have only been 9 confirmed cases of WPV1 associated paralytic disease worldwide this year (2017), compared with 37 cases reported last year (2016). In contrast there have been 40 confirmed cases of cVDPV2 confirmed this year (2017) compared with 5 last year (2016). As a reminder, outbreaks due to cVDPV's are considered as significant in the big picture of polio eradication, as they are due to vaccine polioviruses that have reverted in neurovirulence following passage through multiple individuals while circulating in the susceptible population. The goal of the polio eradication initiative is to interrupt transmission of both the WPV's and the cVDPVs. The presence of cVDPVs occurs when there are areas with low vaccination coverage where the vaccine virus (from the OPV) can continue circulating through the susceptible population. - Mod.MPP ","keywordsMatched":[]},"63":{"title":"Undiagnosed illness - Nigeria (02): (KO) fatal,\r\n\tRFI ","date":["19","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Undiagnosed illness - Nigeria (02): (KO) fatal,\r\n\tRFI [EXTERNAL]","summary":" 2  Thu 17 Aug 2017 Source: Channels Television edited An unknown illness has thrown many families in Kogi State into mourning and left health authorities with a puzzle to solve.

Virus transmission to humans can occur when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or their excreta. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"200":{"title":"Multiple pathogens, seed yam - Nigeria ","date":["18","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/PL> Multiple pathogens, seed yam - Nigeria [EXTERNAL]","summary":"   Fri 18 Aug 2017 Source: SciTech Africa edited According to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization FAO, Nigeria's yam yield has presently dropped to its lowest level in 2 decades, even though the area under cultivation is rapidly rising. Nigeria accounts for 61 per cent of yam production in the world. \"Seed yam is a big problem,\" said Robert Aseidu, International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA). \"It's only now that we're seeing how big a problem this could become.\" Due to many years of flawed farm practice, most seed yams have disease.

Some scientists have seen the urgent need and high demand for disease free seed yams. Aighewi says the solution to Nigeria's seed yam crisis is large-scale aeroponic seed yam production. She also produces high-yielding and disease-resistant yam varieties. byline: Uwagbale Edward-Ekpu  communicated by: ProMED-mail Yam (_Dioscorea_ spp.) is an important tuber crop in Africa, the West Indies and parts of Asia and southern America. A number of fungal (anthracnose, leaf blight, tuber rots), bacterial (pre- and post-harvest wet rots), viral (mosaic, 'shoe-string') and nematode (dry rot) diseases or disease complexes are known to affect the crop. Many of these have been reported from West Africa, including Nigeria (see links below). For predominantly vegetatively propagated crops, including root and tuber crops like yam, potato, taro and cassava, accumulation of multiple viral and other pathogens over successive planting cycles is a high risk. Even low levels of seed tuber infections pose a major risk of both horizontal and vertical pathogen spread. A build up of both numbers and individual levels of pathogens over the planting cycles will eventually lead to weaker and weaker crops, as described above for yams. To return to viable crop production, exclusive use of planting material that was certified, preferably by molecular methods, as being free of pathogens is essential for each crop cycle. Farm saved or other uncertified propagating materials (including seeds, budwood, rootstocks, seed tubers, cuttings) have often been reported as sources of crop disease outbreaks worldwide. Clean planting stock is vital for successful agricultural systems and, consequently, certification schemes have been set up for relevant crops in many countries. In aeroponic systems, as mentioned above, plants are grown in a mist environment, without a medium to support their roots. This differs from hydroponics, where plant roots are immersed in a liquid nutrient solution. In both systems, disease (and pest) control is aided by the absence of soil and minimal requirements for handling the plants during growth.DHA ","keywordsMatched":[]},"422":{"title":"Hemorrhagic disease - Nigeria (2): (KW) responses to RFI\r\n\t","date":["12","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Hemorrhagic disease - Nigeria (2): (KW) responses to RFI\r\n\t[EXTERNAL]","summary":" 3 Government statement denying outbreak  11 Aug 2017 Source: Premium Times edited The Kwara State Government on Friday denied a report that an outbreak of a mystery illness had claimed 70 lives in Oro-Ago in Ifelodun Local Government Area of the state. Suleiman Alege, the State's Commissioner for Health, said the report is a mere rumour as the ministry has no confirmed outbreak of disease or fatalities in any part of the state. Mr. Alege said there are epidemiological systems for reporting suspected disease outbreaks in the state and that if any occurs, the State Health Response team would be the first to know and is always ready to swing into action. The commissioner recalled that when there were reported cases of Cholera in some communities in the state, the state government immediately deployed emergency kits to the affected areas and also commenced vaccination in most of the state primary healthcare centers to forestall outbreak of an epidemic. There had been unverified reports of outbreak of disease in the community on Thursday 10 Aug 2017. But the commissioner noted that immediately the rumour of the strange disease broke on Thursday, the state Ministry of Health deployed a team from the endemic unit under the department of public health to Gaa Okuta community along Oke-ode road in Ifelodun Local Government area. The team, however, found no evidence of any strange illness or casualties, he said. He disclosed that members of the community also insisted that there was no disease outbreak in the area. He added that the community's water source was also tested to ascertain if there was any form of contamination. Similarly, the Ifelodun council Chairman, Mukaila Ayinla, on Friday 11 Aug 2017 said the reports of the alleged disease outbreak in the community are false and should be disregarded. A statement by Muideen Akorede, senior special assistant to the State Governor on Media and Communication, quoted Mr. Ayinla as saying the council was working on posting a new medical team to the primary health care facility in the area, following the transfer of the staff at the facility.

Consultant in communicable disease control for Public Health Wales Dr Rhianwen Stiff said: \"In our current outbreak, we have seen measles pass between pupils at the same school. With children returning from holidays in Europe, and with our ongoing outbreak in Newport and Torfaen, we are concerned that the start of the new term could lead to further cases of measles in Wales. Measles is highly contagious and passes very easily between people who are unvaccinated. The message is simple, MMR offers the best and only protection against measles. If you, or your child, are not up to date with 2 doses of the MMR vaccine, speak to your GP surgery immediately.\" Parents are also being urged not to take children who appear to have measles to hospital or a GP surgery without calling ahead 1st. A vaccination programme in schools across Newport was launched following the 1st outbreak, with 1089 children receiving immunisation. Adults born after 1970 who have never had measles or the MMR vaccine are also being urged to contact their GP to arrange immunisation, especially if they work with children. The 1st dose of the vaccine is usually given to babies between 12 and 13 months, and the 2nd at around 3 years, 4 months. But it can be given at any time. The cases are being directly linked to a larger outbreak in Europe, which has affected 14 000 people, 35 of whom have died, since the start of the year 2017.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. - Mod.LK ","keywordsMatched":[]},"452":{"title":"Poliomyelitis update (21): Syria (DY), Congo DR, cVDPV,\r\n\tglobal ","date":["10","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Poliomyelitis update (21): Syria (DY), Congo DR, cVDPV,\r\n\tglobal [EXTERNAL]","summary":"<br><br><strong>   Thu 10 Aug 2017 Source: Polio Eradication Initiative edited Poliovirus Weekly Update as of: 9 Aug 2017, World Health Organization -</strong><br> New wild poliovirus cases reported this week: 0 Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2017: 8 Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2016: 37 New cVDPV cases reported this week: 0 Total number of cVDPV cases in 2017: 37 Total number of cVDPV cases in 2016: 5 Headlines - The United Kingdom has announced 100 million in new funding to polio eradication to meet the final challenges. - Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: 2 positive environmental samples of wild poliovirus type 1 in Pakistan and 1 in Afghanistan; 3 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus in Syria and 3 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Details in country-specific sections below. Afghanistan - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains five. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 19 Jun 2017 from Kandahar.

The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 11 Jun 2017, from Killa Abdullah, Balochistan. - Two new WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week, the most recent collected on 19 Jul 2017, from Karachi in Sindh. - A special vaccination round is being implemented during August 2017 targeting areas with recent polio cases and positive environmental samples. These include Rawalpindi / Islamabad and demographically connected areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Quetta Block and parts of Karachi. - Under the National Emergency Action Plan for polio eradication, the country is planning to implement 2 nation-wide and 2 sub-national vaccination rounds from September to December 2017. Nigeria - No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 21 Aug 2016 in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno. - Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016). - Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance. Lake Chad Basin - The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno, Nigeria in 2016) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) (Borno and Sokoto provinces in Nigeria in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak. - Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region. Central Africa - Three new cases of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). This brings the total number of cases this year to 7, in 2 separate outbreaks of cVDPV2: in Haut Lomami province (5 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on 13 Jun 2017); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on 26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017, with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May 2017). - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time. Outbreak response is taking place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols, targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 across the 2 provinces. - The 1st mOPV2 round was implemented on 27-29 Jun 2017 in the 2 affected provinces; and the 2nd mOPV2 round ran from 13-15 Jul 2017 in Haut Lomami and 20-22 Jul 2017 in Maniema. - Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries. Middle East - In Syria, 3 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were officially confirmed at WHO headquarters in the past week, bringing the total number of cases in this outbreak to 30. Onset of paralysis of these cases is between 3 Mar 2017 and 16 Jun 2017. 29 of the cases are from Mayadeen district, Deir Ez-Zour governorate, and 1 case is from Talabyad district, Raqqa governorate. - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized and implemented, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Two vaccination campaigns are planned for both Deir Ez-Zour and Raqqa governorates. If there is geographic spread, the extent of these campaigns will have to be adjusted. - The 1st mOPV2 round in Deir Ez-Zour was successfully carried out between 22-26 Jul 2017.

According to this weekly update from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), there are 2 active transmission sites related to cVDPVs - one in Syria and the 2nd in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). Both are areas that have had transmission identified from earlier this year (2017). In the case of Syria, it appears that the transmission of the cVDPV has been localized to the Deir al Zour governorate with a single case having been reported from the neighboring Raqqah governorate (suggesting this may have been an isolated importation). To date there have been 30 cases of polio attributable to the cVDPV in Syria. In the case of the DR Congo, while cases had been identified in 2 provinces, it appears that circulation has continued in only one of the 2 provinces - Haut Lomami province. As the dates of onset of most recent confirmed cases in both Syria and the DR Congo are in mid-June, and control vaccination campaigns were begun in mid-July (in Syria) and late June and mid July (in the 2 affected provinces in the DR Congo), and we are now in early August, it would not be surprising to learn of additional cases over the coming weeks that were infected before the immunization campaigns were completed.. Also noteworthy in the above update is the identification of 2 WPV1 positive environmental samples in Karachi, Sindh Pakistan. The most recent reported (and confirmed) case of polio due to WPV1 in Sindh was in 2016. ( ).  So the identification of the WPV1 in environmental samples is of concern as it indicates an infected individual(s) has been in the area and might be a source for continued tranmission of the WPV1.. - Mod.MPP ","keywordsMatched":[]},"456":{"title":"Hepatitis E - Africa: (Lake Chad Basin) ","date":["10","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Hepatitis E - Africa: (Lake Chad Basin) [EXTERNAL]","summary":"   Thu 10 Aug 2017 Source: Devex.com edited The hepatitis E virus has become the latest menace in West Africa's ongoing Lake Chad Basin crisis, compounding major challenges already impacting the region, including the threat of violent militant group Boko Haram, food insecurity and limited access to remote and vulnerable populations. Even more troubling, the virus seems to be circulating among displaced populations who frequently uproot and migrate, making it that much harder to contain. Following a recent visit to northeast Nigeria, Dr Philippa Easterbrook, a senior scientist for the WHO's global hepatitis program, spoke to Devex about a recently-developed WHO response plan created to reduce the number of new cases of the virus and provide training to local health workers as a means of improving case management and diagnosis. This water-borne infection was 1st reported in August 2016 in Chad's Samalat region, to the country's southeast. As of July 2017, the country had reported more than 1600 suspected or confirmed cases, and 18 deaths. The virus then surfaced in neighboring Niger in January 2017, in the Diffa region, an area near the Chad and Nigeria borders. Hepatitis E cases here spiked dramatically in mid-April 2017, and decreased before then increasing again. Now approximately 1450 people are suspected to have been infected, more than half of those women, with 38 fatalities. With the frequent movement of internally displaced populations, the infection eventually arrived in Nigeria in May 2017, in Damasak, a town near the Niger border, and has since seen 696 cases total, mostly at the Ngala internally displaced people's camp, near the Cameroon border in Borno state. Currently, all cases of hepatitis E in the Lake Chad region have been among displaced persons and refugees, Easterbrook explained. \"This led us to the working hypothesis that these outbreaks are all linked and related to large population movements,\" she said. Without immediate attention, humanitarians are concerned that the virus could spread even further within impacted countries and even into unaffected areas, such as neighboring Cameroon or the Central African Republic. Even more so, this outbreak is highlighting the unsanitary water conditions affecting those impacted by conflict in the Lake Chad Basin. Hepatitis E is most dangerous in pregnant women, and has an incubation period of 2 to 10 weeks where the infection remains asymptomatic and undetected in most people. Usually symptoms include flu-like symptoms such as: Low-grade fever, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and most notably jaundice. Because the virus carries symptoms also seen in hepatitis A, yellow fever and malaria cases, diagnosing patients and managing cases can be a challenge. Roughly 5 percent of cases develop more serious complications, according to Easterbrook, however the biggest risk is developing acute liver failure, or in pregnant women, post-partum hemorrhaging which can be fatal. The most pressing agenda in the response plan is the improvement of water and sanitation hygiene in the region. As the virus spreads via contaminated water, Easterbrook cited that the improvement of WASH conditions would not only support the reduction in new hepatitis E cases, but could also reduce the prevalence of other infectious diseases, namely hepatitis A, cholera, and typhoid. To date, roughly 200 restrooms and 100 showers have been constructed in Ngala camp. WHO has also worked with local partners to rehabilitate water points and distribute hygiene kits, which include items such as sanitary napkins and water purification tablets, to women and households. However, cultural barriers impede the progress of these initiatives. \"Some people would rather have low-level restroom facilities rather than walk some distance to a more modernized latrine,\" Easterbrook explained.

Genotypes 3 and 4 are zoonotic, with swine being a major reservoir, and tend to be seen in the developed world. Type 3 in particular can cause chronic infection, especially in the immunocompromised host. - Mod.LL   .

The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness. As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea: \"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as \"potentially the most important medical advance\" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5). \"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below.

That being said, there have only been 9 confirmed cases of WPV1 associated paralytic disease worldwide this year (2017), compared with 37 cases reported last year (2016). In contrast there have been 40 confirmed cases of cVDPV2 confirmed this year (2017) compared with 5 last year (2016). As a reminder, outbreaks due to cVDPV's are considered as significant in the big picture of polio eradication, as they are due to vaccine polioviruses that have reverted in neurovirulence following passage through multiple individuals while circulating in the susceptible population. The goal of the polio eradication initiative is to interrupt transmission of both the WPV's and the cVDPVs. The presence of cVDPVs occurs when there are areas with low vaccination coverage where the vaccine virus (from the OPV) can continue circulating through the susceptible population. - Mod.MPP ","keywordsMatched":[]},"48":{"title":"Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (86): Africa,\r\n\tAsia ","date":["18","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (86): Africa,\r\n\tAsia [EXTERNAL]","summary":" 4 Cholera - Pakistan (Punjab Province)  Wed 16 Aug 2017 Source: The News edited The number of cases of cholera, a highly contagious and fatal disease is continuously on the rise and there is a threat that spread of the infection may take shape of an epidemic if proper preventive and control measures are not taken well in time. The 1st 2 cases of cholera were tested positive by National Institute of Health Islamabad on Mon 31 Jul 2017 and another 2 confirmed positive for the infection on Fri 4 Aug 2017. All the 4 patients were undergoing treatment at Benazir Bhutto Hospital BH where as many as 4 more suspects of the infection have been admitted for treatment. Data collected by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017 reveals that the allied hospitals have sent stool samples of over 10 child patients to NIH for confirmation of cholera in last week week of Sun 6 Aug 2017. On Sat 12 Aug 2017, as many as 20 child patients with severe diarrhoea were admitted at the BBH of which 4 were suspected as patients of cholera and their stool samples were sent to NIH for confirmation, said Associate Professor of Paediatrics at Rawalpindi Medical University Dr Tariq Saeed when contacted by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017. He added the hospital has not received confirmation reports from the NIH because of holidays there from Saturday to Monday. However, we have been keeping the suspects in isolation under strict monitoring, he said. He added that repeated rainfalls in the region and water inundation inside and outside homes in a number of localities particularly in thickly populated areas of the city are causing contamination of water and foodstuff that increases chances of spread of a number of infections among population while children are at greater risk of contracting life-threatening infections including cholera. It is important that the transmission of cholera occurs primarily by drinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the feces (waste product) of an infected person, including one with no apparent symptoms. It is observed that heavy rainfall causes collection of heavily contaminated water in streets and houses and the waste water flooding out of various nullahs watercourses including Nullah Leh in town causes infections including cholera, typhoid, dysentery, gastroenteritis, hepatitis A and E, shigellosis and giardiasis. Professor Tariq said the consumption of contaminated water and foodstuff causes cholera, an infection in the small intestine caused by bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. Its main symptoms are watery diarrhea and vomiting that can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, and death in cases which are not treated in time, he said. Health experts say that to avoid cholera and other infections, one must use boiled water for drinking and should use vegetables after washing with clean water and it must be kept in mind that raw vegetables should not be eaten in the existing weather conditions instead these should be used after cooking. To a query, Professor Tariq said the heavy rainfall and water accumulation may contaminate water at sources and there may be chances of contamination of water at tube wells so individuals must boil water before drinking to avoid cholera and other infections. He added the appearance of cholera is alarming and it is time for people to take extra ordinary preventive measures to safeguard their children and themselves from the disease. In case water is accumulated inside home due to heavy rainfall and flooded out of sewage lines, it must be wiped out immediately and the space should be washed with clean water as soon as possible to avoid infections. Avoiding inundation of contaminated water inside homes is a must to avoid cholera and other infections, said Professor Tariq. Byline: Muhammad Qasim  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-SoAs Aggressive interventions to stem outbreaks of cholera include providing sources of clean water and a vaccination campaign. The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80 percent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:  - Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_; - Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65 percent (95 percent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam;  - Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however, have suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be effective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and outbreak situations (63, 64).<br><br><strong> \"References </strong><br> 57.

According to NIH, the objective of this advice was to sensitize human and animal health care authorities to further strengthen and improve the level of preparedness in prevention and control of CCHF. The notice, which was issued by the NIH Field Epidemiology and Disease Surveillance Division, said that the CCHF is a widespread disease caused by a tickborne virus (Nairovirus) of the Bunyaviridae family with a case fatality rate of 10 to 40 per cent. It added that the ticks, especially of the _Hyalomma_ genus, are both a reservoir and a vector for the CCHF while numerous wild and domestic animals such as cattle, buffaloes, goats and sheep are silent carriers of this virus, and the adult ticks feed on these animals. The notice said that although Balochistan remains the most affected province, cases have been reported from almost all parts of the country. During 2016, out of 101 confirmed cases, 33 patients died. During 2017, till date, a total of 41 confirmed cases have been reported including 16 from Balochistan, 15 from Punjab, 7 from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and 3 from FATA. The advisory notice said that the virus is transmitted to the people either through tick bites or through contact with the infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughtering them. Public health workers along with animal herders, veterinarians, para-veterinary staff, livestock workers, animal merchants, butchers and slaughterhouse workers are at risk of the disease. Apart from the above mentioned, people close to or taking care of a suspected patient, and individuals involved in burial practices are also at a risk of getting infected, it added. There is currently no vaccine available for humans and the only way to reduce infection is by raising awareness. The notice further added that public health advice should focus on several aspects including wearing protective clothing  such as long sleeves and trousers. People should be advised to wear light coloured clothes during a visit to the animal market to allow easy detection of ticks, and to regularly examine clothing and skin for ticks and if found, removing them safely and using approved repellents on clothing and skin. Similarly, citizens have been asked not to crush the ticks, wear gloves and other protective clothing while handling animals or their tissues, notably during slaughtering, butchering and culling procedures in slaughterhouses or at home. They have also been asked to avoid close physical contact with infected people, wearing gloves and protective equipment when taking care of them. People are also asked to wash hands frequently during caring or after visiting a patient. The notice stated that insect repellents are the most effective in warding off ticks in human populations.  communicated by: ProMED-mail The National Institute of Health Pakistan has issued this CCHF advisory notice in view of the upcoming Eid Ul Adha, when large numbers of livestock and cattle are moved from rural areas to urban markets for sale and subsequent slaughter. More spatial repellent products are becoming commercially available. These products, containing active ingredients such as metofluthrin and allethrin, augment aerosol insecticide sprays, vaporizing mats, and mosquito coils, which have been available for some time. Such products can help to clear rooms or areas of mosquitoes (spray aerosols) or repel mosquitoes from a circumscribed area (coils, spatial repellents). Although many of these products appear to have repellent or insecticidal activity under particular conditions, they have not yet been adequately evaluated in peer-reviewed studies for their efficacy in preventing vectorborne disease. Travelers should supplement the use of these products with repellent on skin or clothing and using bed nets in areas where vectorborne diseases are a risk or biting arthropods are noted  . CDC has evaluated information published in peer-reviewed scientific literature and data available from EPA to identify several types of EPA-registered products that provide repellent activity sufficient to help people reduce the bites of disease-carrying mosquitoes. Products containing the following active ingredients typically provide reasonably long-lasting protection:  - DEET (chemical name: N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide or N,N-diethyl-3-methyl-benzamide). Products containing DEET include, but are not limited to, Off!, Cutter, Sawyer, and Ultrathon.  - Picaridin (KBR 3023 Bayrepel and icaridin outside the US; chemical name: 2-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperidinecarboxylic acid 1-methylpropyl ester). Products containing picaridin include, but are not limited to, Cutter Advanced, Skin So Soft Bug Guard Plus, and Autan (outside the US).  - Oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE) or PMD (chemical name: para-menthane-3,8-diol), the synthesized version of OLE. Products containing OLE and PMD include, but are not limited to, Repel and Off ! Botanicals. This recommendation refers to EPA-registered products containing the active ingredient OLE (or PMD). \"Pure\" oil of lemon eucalyptus (essential oil not formulated as a repellent) is not recommended; it has not undergone similar, validated testing for safety and efficacy and is not registered with EPA as an insect repellent.  - IR3535 (chemical name: 3-N-butyl-N-acetyl-aminopropionic acid, ethyl ester). Products containing IR3535 include, but are not limited to, Skin So Soft Bug Guard Plus Expedition and SkinSmart.  - 2-undecanone (chemical name: methyl nonyl ketone). The product BioUD contains 2-undecanone. Published data indicate that repellent efficacy and duration of protection vary considerably among products and among mosquito and tick species. Product efficacy and duration of protection are also markedly affected by ambient temperature, level of activity, amount of perspiration, exposure to water, abrasive removal, and other factors. In general, higher concentrations of active ingredient provide longer duration of protection, regardless of the active ingredient. Products with less than 10 per cent active ingredient may offer only limited protection, often 1-2 hours. Products that offer sustained-release or controlled-release (microencapsulated) formulations, even with lower active ingredient concentrations, may provide longer protection times. Studies suggest that concentrations of DEET above approximately 50 per cent do not offer a marked increase in protection time against mosquitoes; DEET efficacy tends to plateau at a concentration of about 50 per cent. CDC recommends using products with at least 20 per cent DEET on exposed skin to reduce biting by ticks that may spread disease. DEET-containing repellents prevent both mosquito and tick bites. Health Canada recommends using a product containing no more than 10 per cent DEET for children up to 12 years of age. However, products with a DEET concentration of 10 per cent or less should not be used for exposures lasting longer than 1 h to 2 h because they may not be effective in preventing tick bites. For children over 12 years of age and adults, a repellent containing up to 30 per cent DEET can be used as recommended on the product label. In the United States, 30 per cent DEET is approved for children aged 2 months of age and older. Reapplication of DEET is indicated only if the estimated protection period has passed and a significant risk of arthropod bites remains. Adverse events from DEET are rare. Contact dermatitis and eye irritation are the commonest side effects. Toxic encephalopathy has been reported, usually with prolonged or excessive use, or occasional DEET ingestion  . Permethrin, a synthetic pyrethroid , is highly effective both as an insecticide and as a repellent. It is not licensed to be used as a topical repellent but can be sprayed on clothing (mesh jackets, hats, shoes) bed nets and camping gear to repel and kill ticks, mosquitoes and other insects. - Mod.UBA   .

The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness. As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea: \"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as \"potentially the most important medical advance\" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5). \"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.<br><br><strong>\" References </strong><br> 1.

Narrating specifically about Punjab, the highest populated with relatively better infrastructure, the mosquito control measures were first strengthened following 2009-10 multi-district fatal outbreaks of dengue hemorrhagic fever. Special surveillance for _Aedes_ larvae is being conducted on largest scale in Punjab. House-to-house surveying for indoor and outdoor larvae detection has yielded substantial biological evidence over last 6-7 years with resultant seasonal pattern identification. Legislation and law enforcement regarding epidemic prevention and control has also yielded good results. This active surveillance has contributed much toward control of _Aedes_ mosquito and hence the dengue virus and chikungunya virus transmission, despite highest mass transit from all endemic and outbreak foci. In Punjab, only 3 cases of chikungunya have been confirmed in 2017. These are not epi-linked and sporadic in occurrence over wide geographical area. 2 of these have traveled with infection from Sindh Province. 1 case has acquired infection in Punjab. Larvae detection is always high in the monsoon season. Surveillance activities in the field are android enabled and transformed onto an electronic dashboard for daily progress monitoring of real time geo-tagging of detected larvae. Hence, it can be projected that Punjab is least likely to be involved in any bigger outbreaks of chikungunya virus with such strict control measures. If control measures are haltered, the vector is present and may start transmitting viruses at a greater pace.  <br><br>Communicated by: EpiCore Surveillance Project member Dr Sarmad W Siddiqui Fellow FELTP-Pakistan ProMED-mail thanks Dr Gaines and Dr Siddiqui for their insightful comments and hopes that public health and vector control authorities in Pakistan will be able to deliberate further on this matter and incorporate similar larvicidal agents in their control strategies, if they are not being used currently. Any updates from EpiCore members in the region on the current vector control practices in use in Pakistan would be appreciated. - Mod.UBA   .

Details in country-specific sections below. Afghanistan - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains five. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 19 Jun 2017 from Kandahar. One new WPV1-positive environmental sample was reported in the past week, collected on 7 Jul 2017 from Lashkargah in Helmand province. - Preparations are continuing for the next round of the National Immunization Days starting on 14 Aug 2017. There is special focus on ensuring high quality vaccination drive in the southern region of the country. Pakistan - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week; the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains three. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 11 Jun 2017, from Killa Abdullah, Balochistan. - Two new WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week, the most recent collected on 19 Jul 2017, from Karachi in Sindh. - A special vaccination round is being implemented during August 2017 targeting areas with recent polio cases and positive environmental samples. These include Rawalpindi / Islamabad and demographically connected areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Quetta Block and parts of Karachi. - Under the National Emergency Action Plan for polio eradication, the country is planning to implement 2 nation-wide and 2 sub-national vaccination rounds from September to December 2017. Nigeria - No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 21 Aug 2016 in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno. - Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016). - Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance. Lake Chad Basin - The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno, Nigeria in 2016) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) (Borno and Sokoto provinces in Nigeria in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak. - Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region. Central Africa - Three new cases of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). This brings the total number of cases this year to 7, in 2 separate outbreaks of cVDPV2: in Haut Lomami province (5 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on 13 Jun 2017); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on 26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017, with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May 2017). - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time. Outbreak response is taking place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols, targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 across the 2 provinces. - The 1st mOPV2 round was implemented on 27-29 Jun 2017 in the 2 affected provinces; and the 2nd mOPV2 round ran from 13-15 Jul 2017 in Haut Lomami and 20-22 Jul 2017 in Maniema. - Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries. Middle East - In Syria, 3 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were officially confirmed at WHO headquarters in the past week, bringing the total number of cases in this outbreak to 30. Onset of paralysis of these cases is between 3 Mar 2017 and 16 Jun 2017. 29 of the cases are from Mayadeen district, Deir Ez-Zour governorate, and 1 case is from Talabyad district, Raqqa governorate. - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized and implemented, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Two vaccination campaigns are planned for both Deir Ez-Zour and Raqqa governorates. If there is geographic spread, the extent of these campaigns will have to be adjusted. - The 1st mOPV2 round in Deir Ez-Zour was successfully carried out between 22-26 Jul 2017. Independent post-campaign monitoring reflected coverage of 88.4 percent (based on caregiver recall). The 2nd round is planned for 19-23 Aug 2017, and will include mOPV2 and IPV.- Raqqa Governorate plans to start mOPV2 campaigns on 12 Aug 2017. - Plans are being finalized to mitigate the risks of further spread from the outbreak zone to neighbouring areas and countries, including immunization of at-risk populations in northwest Syria, Turkey and Lebanon.

According to this weekly update from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), there are 2 active transmission sites related to cVDPVs - one in Syria and the 2nd in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). Both are areas that have had transmission identified from earlier this year (2017). In the case of Syria, it appears that the transmission of the cVDPV has been localized to the Deir al Zour governorate with a single case having been reported from the neighboring Raqqah governorate (suggesting this may have been an isolated importation). To date there have been 30 cases of polio attributable to the cVDPV in Syria. In the case of the DR Congo, while cases had been identified in 2 provinces, it appears that circulation has continued in only one of the 2 provinces - Haut Lomami province. As the dates of onset of most recent confirmed cases in both Syria and the DR Congo are in mid-June, and control vaccination campaigns were begun in mid-July (in Syria) and late June and mid July (in the 2 affected provinces in the DR Congo), and we are now in early August, it would not be surprising to learn of additional cases over the coming weeks that were infected before the immunization campaigns were completed.. Also noteworthy in the above update is the identification of 2 WPV1 positive environmental samples in Karachi, Sindh Pakistan. The most recent reported (and confirmed) case of polio due to WPV1 in Sindh was in 2016. ( ).  So the identification of the WPV1 in environmental samples is of concern as it indicates an infected individual(s) has been in the area and might be a source for continued tranmission of the WPV1.. - Mod.MPP ","keywordsMatched":[]},"503":{"title":"Dengue/DHF update (10): Asia, Pacific, Africa, research, WHO\r\n\t","date":["25","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Dengue/DHF update (10): Asia, Pacific, Africa, research, WHO\r\n\t[EXTERNAL]","summary":" 3 WHO update  The 15 Aug 2017 Source: WHO Western Pacific region edited Dengue situation update no.<br><br><strong> 523 - Northern hemisphere -</strong><br> Cambodia As of 8 Aug 2017, a total of 1604 suspected dengue fever cases were reported in 2017.

Zika virus (or Zika) has been reported in Palau. Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in Palau are infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:  Women who are pregnant:  Do not travel to Palau.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to Palau or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.

Emerg Microbes Infect. 2017; 6(8): e69. doi: 10.1038/emi.2017.<br><br><strong>59  Abstract </strong><br> Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has recently been associated with an increased incidence of neonatal microcephaly and other neurological disorders. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito bite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some cases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main vector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other mosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the virus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit ZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of laboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. Interestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the midgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in Recife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially fed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx. quinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced. Collectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range of ZIKV vectors than anticipated.  <br><br>Communicated by: Roland Hübner Superior Health Council Brussels Belgium Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active virus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their ability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step toward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_ fed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in saliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing. The study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a competent vector. Several other studies have shown this species to be inefficient vectors or refractory to Zika virus infection. One wonders if the specific _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ used or the Zika virus isolates with which they were tested could account for these very different results. Resolving these discrepancies is important because this mosquito species is very widely distributed around the world and bears directly on risk of outbreaks in geographic areas where _Aedes aegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_ , Zika virus vectors, do not occur. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"103":{"title":["Zika Virus in Panama"],"date":["08","August","2017"],"url":"wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/alert/zika-virus-panama","summary":"Mosquitoes that can spread Zika usually live in places below 6,500 feet.

Zika virus (or Zika) has been reported in Paraguay. Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in Paraguay are infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:  Women who are pregnant:  Do not travel to Paraguay.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to Paraguay or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers considering pregnancy:  Before you or your partner travel, talk to your health care provider about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection.  Wait before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.  If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex &ndash; or do not have sex &ndash; for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More Zika information for pregnant women  2.

Travelers considering pregnancy  Talk to your health care provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you&rsquo;re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Wait at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  Men are advised to wait longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.gov  Contact CDC  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  1600 Clifton Road  Atlanta ,  GA  30329-4027  USA  800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)  Contact CDC-INFO  TOP","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Peru":{"62":{"title":"Zika virus (16): Americas, Asia, research,\r\n\tobservations ","date":["17","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Zika virus (16): Americas, Asia, research,\r\n\tobservations [EXTERNAL]","summary":" 11 _Culex quinquefasciatus_ as vectors  Wed 9 Aug 2017 Source: Emerging Microbes & Infections edited ref: Guedes DR, Paiva MH, Donato MM, et al.

Emerg Microbes Infect. 2017; 6(8): e69. doi: 10.1038/emi.2017.<br><br><strong>59  Abstract </strong><br> Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has recently been associated with an increased incidence of neonatal microcephaly and other neurological disorders. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito bite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some cases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main vector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other mosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the virus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit ZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of laboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. Interestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the midgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in Recife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially fed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx. quinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced. Collectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range of ZIKV vectors than anticipated.  <br><br>Communicated by: Roland Hübner Superior Health Council Brussels Belgium Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active virus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their ability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step toward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_ fed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in saliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing. The study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a competent vector. Several other studies have shown this species to be inefficient vectors or refractory to Zika virus infection. One wonders if the specific _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ used or the Zika virus isolates with which they were tested could account for these very different results. Resolving these discrepancies is important because this mosquito species is very widely distributed around the world and bears directly on risk of outbreaks in geographic areas where _Aedes aegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_ , Zika virus vectors, do not occur. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"91":{"title":"Chikungunya (27) - Americas, Europe, Asia ","date":["18","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Chikungunya (27) - Americas, Europe, Asia [EXTERNAL]","summary":"<br><br><strong> Cases in various countries: Regional summaries - Americas -</strong><br> WHO/PAHO report 18 Aug 2017 Reported cases of chikungunya fever in the Americas, by country or territory - 2017 to EW 33 week ending 18 Aug 2017.

Given the outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections in the region, and the clinical similarity of cases of that virus infection and CHIKV infection, one wonders how many cases that were not laboratory confirmed but clinically diagnosed as ZIKV infections were, in reality, CHIKV infections. It is also possible that a significant proportion of the population have been infected by CHIKV in the previous 3 years and are now immune.

Japanese encephalitis is a viral disease spread by blood-sucking insects, particularly mosquitoes. The mosquitoes of the _Culex_ species are known to be the viral carriers. The DOH said it affects the nervous system, causes severe complications and even death. The disease can infect not only humans but domestic animals, birds, bats, snakes, and frogs as well. Among the symptoms of Japanese encephalitis, according to the DOH, are flu-like illnesses, fever, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, and tiredness. The symptoms usually appear 6-8 days after the mosquito bite. If untreated, patients could suffer brain damage or paralysis as it also affects the spinal cord. In 30 percent of the cases, death could occur. Young children are more vulnerable due to their weak immune system. While there is no cure, the virus could be prevented through vaccination. A separate report from the World Health Organization (WHO) said that Japanese encephalitis is an illness that is endemic in the Philippines and is fatal in almost 3 out of 10 serious cases. The WHO report also said that nearly all survivors of this mosquito-borne disease experience permanent damage, including physical disabilities, cognitive and language problems, learning disabilities and behavioral problems. Byline: Ian Ocampo Flora  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail This is a cluster of Japanese encephalitis in central Luzon Island. Clusters have been relatively rare in the Philippines. There have been relatively few reports of human Japanese encephalitis (JE) cases in the Philippines in recent years, although the islands are within the JE virus endemic zone. Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable encephalitis in Asia and the western Pacific. It is caused by a virus transmitted by culicine mosquitoes. Ardeid birds (including herons) are the reservoir species in nature. Most human infections are asymptomatic or result in only mild symptoms. However, a small percentage of infected persons develop encephalitis, with symptoms including sudden onset of headache, high fever, disorientation, coma, tremors, and convulsions. About 1 in 4 encephalitis cases is fatal. Apparently, none of the cases in the report above died. There is no specific treatment for JE. Patient management focuses on supportive care and management of complications. Steps to prevent JE virus infections include vaccination and use of personal protective measures to prevent mosquito bites. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"195":{"title":"Avian influenza, human (68): Philippines, H5N6 ","date":["22","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH/EDR> Avian influenza, human (68): Philippines, H5N6 [EXTERNAL]","summary":"   Thu 24 Aug 2016 Source: CNN Philippines edited The bird flu that has hit parts of the Philippines has been confirmed to be H5N6  a strain that can be transmitted to humans.

Agriculture officials were quick to assure, however, that the strain is slow to spread and causes few deaths. \"The rate of transmission is very, very low,\" Arlene Vytiaco, who heads animal disease control in the Bureau of Animal Industry, said in a press briefing on Thursday. She explained that countries like Japan and Myamnar have been affected by H5N6 but have reported no humans infected by the avian influenza. \"The mortality rate is also low,\" Vytiaco said. Since H5N6 started in 2014, only 20 deaths have been reported worldwide. The Department of Health has been conducting regular check-ups on farmers and workers in areas hit by the bird flu outbreak.

The government had been waiting to see what the bird flu's specific N strain was - particularly on the lookout for the N1 and N6 strains, which can be passed on to humans. Local tests had confirmed it was not the far deadlier H5N1 virus. However, it had to send samples to Australia to check whether it was H5N6, since the government did not have its own test kits here. This was said by Dr Arlene Vytiaco, who oversees disease control for the Bureau of Animal Industry. Reports of bird flu being present were 1st reported earlier this month August 2017. The virus was found in birds from 7 farms in San Luis, Pampanga. The Department of Agriculture DA earlier said the virus had been present since April 2017, but was only reported in August 2017 after 37 000 birds had died. It added the strain of avian flu present in these birds was not transmissible to humans. On Sun 13 Aug 2017, agriculture secretary Manny Piñol said another round of tests was under way to determine whether H5N6  the strain of the virus that can be passed on to humans  was present.

In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea: \"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as \"potentially the most important medical advance\" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5). \"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.<br><br><strong>\" References </strong><br> 1.

According to the media, \"The Philippines will cull 200 000 chickens, quail and ducks after confirming the country's 1st outbreak of bird flu,\" Agriculture Secretary Emmanuel Pinol said on Friday 4 Aug 2017?. The avian flu outbreak was detected in a farm in San Luis municipality in Pampanga province, north of the capital Manila, which later spread to 5 neighbouring farms. There has been no case of human transmission, although health officials are conducting checks on farm workers. \"We have declared a one-km quarantine radius with the epicenter being San Luis. All fowl found within the area will be culled and buried, and the estimated population is 200 000,\" Pinol told reporters at a news conference. The volume of birds to be culled was half of Pinol's initial estimate of 400 000, which he said was based on a preliminary evaluation and was later revised after inspection. The government's report on Friday 4 Aug 2017? to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) described the flu virus in affected birds as an H5 subtype of highly pathogenic (high-path) avian influenza. Initial tests ruled out high-path H5N1 as the virus strain, Dr. Celia Carlos told reporters, and samples will be sent to Australia for further testing. \"The Department of Health is doing surveillance of possible human cases, especially concentrating on people who have been exposed to the affected animals or poultry,\" Carlos said. Culling should be completed within the next 3 days, said Pinol. The virus may have come from migratory birds from China or smuggled ducks, also from China, he said. There were indications as early as April 2017 of bird flu hitting one farm, but the situation worsened in July 2017, with around 37 000 birds dying during the period, Pinol said.

Only the Calauan case has so far reached the Calabarzon office of the Department of Health, according to Dr Rio Magpantay, DOH regional director. The regional office, however, had also started monitoring \"signs and symptoms\" of possible Japanese encephalitis incidence in other parts of Laguna. Calabarzon stands for the provinces of Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, and Quezon. The disease, which is transmitted by the _Culex_ mosquito, commonly causes abdominal pains, fever, and seizures.

DEFRA UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs has upgraded the threat to the UK from 'very low' to 'low'  meaning the risk is \"rare but could occur\" (EFSA European Food Safety Authority terminology). This severe disease of pigs entered Europe through Georgia in 2007, and has since continued to the Russian Federation and eastern Europe, including EU countries in the Baltic States, Poland and very recently the Czech Republic, in wild boar. In early August 2017, an outbreak was confirmed for the 1st time in Romania among backyard pigs. African swine fever is caused by infection with ASF virus (ASFV), which can have fatality rates of up to 100 per cent. The virus causes acute disease in domestic pigs and wild boar, and may cause varying clinical signs that are similar to other pig diseases such as high fever, lethargy and loss of appetite. Pigs may also die suddenly without clinical signs. Although the virus does not cause disease in humans, the impact it has on the economy, especially through trade and farming, is substantial. As a consequence of ASF in Poland and the Baltic States the value of pork and pig exports was reduced by USD 960 million (2014-2015). In Denmark, the predicted impact of an ASF outbreak is estimated at USD 12 million in direct losses and USD 349 million in exports. Unless the appropriate control measures are put in place, additional outbreaks could occur across Europe, further into Russia and beyond to Asia. An outbreak in the UK is unlikely as imports of meat and pigs are extremely well regulated and the UK does not have a wild boar population substantial enough or widespread enough to maintain an outbreak. However, personal imports of pork products from affected areas could result in disease incursion if deliberately or accidently fed to pigs or wild boar, actions which are illegal. The seriousness of an outbreak for some countries could be far worse than others; China is home to over half the world's pig population and an outbreak of ASF could result in devastating consequences. In a Veterinary Record article see reference below world-expert on ASF Dr Linda Dixon leader of the ASF group at The Pirbright Institute, outlines the factors that increase the likelihood of ASF spreading to China and highlights areas that could be improved to reduce the risk of an outbreak including biosecurity.  communicated by: ProMED-mail Subscribers may refer to more data in the article above, addressing the following questions: - how does ASF spread? - how quickly does it spread? - how can the spread of ASFV be prevented? - what is The Pirbright Institute doing to help?

Ministers and food safety chiefs from around the European Union are set to meet on Tue 6 Sep 2017 in a bid to get countries to stop \"blaming and shaming\" each other over the scare involving the chemical fipronil. Millions of eggs have been pulled from supermarket shelves across Europe and dozens of poultry farms closed since the discovery of fipronil, which can harm human health, was made public on 1 Aug 2017. The issue has sparked a row between Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, the 3 countries at the epicentre of the crisis, about how long they knew about the problem. \"Blaming and shaming will bring us nowhere and I want to stop this,\" Vytenis Andriukaitis, the European Commissioner for health and food safety, told AFP as he announced the meeting. \"We need to work together to draw the necessary lessons and move forward instead.\" European Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said that \"this is not, let's be clear, a crisis meeting\" and it is being held next month September 2017 to get \"distance to the events\". Fipronil is commonly used to get rid of fleas, lice and ticks from animals but is banned by the European Union from use in the food industry. The EU insists there is no threat to human health, but the World Health Organization (WHO) says that when eaten in large quantities it can harm people's kidneys, liver and thyroid glands. Brussels said the 15 affected EU countries were Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Sweden, Britain, Austria, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Denmark, along with non-EU Switzerland. But in a sign the crisis is going global, Brussels also announced that Hong Kong had received some tainted eggs from the Netherlands, with the southern Chinese city becoming the 1st place in Asia known to be affected. As well as dealing with the immediate food safety issue, the EU is also seeking to calm tempers over the egg row after a series of divisive crises in the bloc in recent years, from Brexit to migration. Belgium earlier this week week of Mon 6 Aug 2017 accused the Netherlands of knowing about the fipronil eggs since November 2016 and failing to notify other countries. On Thu 10 Aug 2017 Dutch Health Minister Edith Schippers admitted the government had made \"errors\" but denied a cover-up. \"We were well aware of a report of the presence of fipronil in the pens of egg-laying hens in November 2016, but there was no indication at the time that fipronil itself was found in the eggs,\" said Schippers. A Dutch whistleblower separately said he had told the authorities that Chickfriend, the Dutch company at the centre of the scandal, was illegally using fipronil in the treatment of lice in chicken pens in The Netherlands. \"I am the anonymous whistleblower,\" Nick Hermens told the NPO public broadcaster. A Belgian company, Poultry Vision, has said it provided Chickfriend with the chemical. Dutch and Belgian investigators carried out coordinated raids on several premises on Thu 10 Aug 2017, arresting 2 people at Chickfriend. However, Belgium itself has been forced to admit that it knew about fipronil in eggs back in June 2017 but kept it secret for nearly 2 months because of a criminal investigation. Fresh discoveries of contaminated eggs have continued daily. Denmark said on Fri 11 Aug 2017 it had found 2 tonnes of fipronil-tainted scrambled eggs, bringing the total of contaminated eggs to 22 tonnes, mainly from Belgium. Poland said it had discovered about 40 000 eggs imported from Germany. French Agriculture Minister Stephane Travert said that since April 2017 the country had sold nearly 250 000 contaminated eggs, imported from Belgium and the Netherlands, but the risk for consumers was \"very low\" given French eating habits. The food scare is one of the biggest to hit Europe since the 2013 horsemeat scandal when equine meat was falsely labelled and mis-sold. Previous food scandals include contamination of chickens and eggs by dioxin in 1999, which began in Belgium, and mad-cow disease via cattle feed contaminated by the ground-up carcasses of animals infected with a deadly brain disorder - which ran from roughly 1986 to 1998 and started in Britain.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\.

Emerg Microbes Infect. 2017; 6(8): e69. doi: 10.1038/emi.2017.<br><br><strong>59  Abstract </strong><br> Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has recently been associated with an increased incidence of neonatal microcephaly and other neurological disorders. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito bite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some cases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main vector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other mosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the virus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit ZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of laboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. Interestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the midgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in Recife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially fed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx. quinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced. Collectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range of ZIKV vectors than anticipated.  <br><br>Communicated by: Roland Hübner Superior Health Council Brussels Belgium Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active virus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their ability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step toward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_ fed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in saliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing. The study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a competent vector. Several other studies have shown this species to be inefficient vectors or refractory to Zika virus infection. One wonders if the specific _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ used or the Zika virus isolates with which they were tested could account for these very different results. Resolving these discrepancies is important because this mosquito species is very widely distributed around the world and bears directly on risk of outbreaks in geographic areas where _Aedes aegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_ , Zika virus vectors, do not occur. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"171":{"title":["Zika Virus in Puerto Rico"],"date":["08","August","2017"],"url":"wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/alert/zika-virus-puerto-rico","summary":" Magill Partners GeoSentinel Global TravEpiNet Mobile Apps RSS Feeds  Zika Virus in Puerto Rico  Recommend on Facebook  Tweet  Share Compartir  Warning - Level 3, Avoid Nonessential Travel  Alert - Level 2, Practice Enhanced Precautions  Watch - Level 1, Practice Usual Precautions  Language:  Select  Espa&ntilde;ol  What is the current situation?  Zika virus (or Zika) has been reported in Puerto Rico. Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in Puerto Rico are infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:  Women who are pregnant:  Do not travel to Puerto Rico.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to Puerto Rico or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers considering pregnancy:  Before you or your partner travel, talk to your health care provider about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection.  Wait before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.  If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex &ndash; or do not have sex &ndash; for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More Zika information for pregnant women  2.

Travelers considering pregnancy  Talk to your health care provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you&rsquo;re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Wait at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  Men are advised to wait longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.gov  Contact CDC  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  1600 Clifton Road  Atlanta ,  GA  30329-4027  USA  800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)  Contact CDC-INFO  TOP","keywordsMatched":[]},"749":{"title":"Zika virus (17): Americas, research, observations ","date":["24","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Zika virus (17): Americas, research, observations [EXTERNAL]","summary":" 6 Vaccine update  22/29 Aug 2017 Source: Journal of the American Medical Association, JAMA edited ref: Lyon J.

Multiple candidate Zika vaccines have been shown protective against infection with the virus in animal studies, with several now in human trials, but none were tested in the context of pregnancy, according to the authors of the study published in Cell  . The 2 vaccine candidates investigated in the new study are the 1st to demonstrate efficacy in preventing vertical transmission of the virus and related fetal death in an animal model. Although the vaccines were administered to female mice prior to pregnancy, the result is considered an important step toward developing a vaccine that could be safely given to pregnant women. One of the 2 candidates is a modified messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine encoding Zika genes, developed by the biotechnology company Moderna. It is already in safety trials in women who are not pregnant. The other is a live-attenuated Zika strain developed by researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). The testing was carried out by scientists from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Washington University School of Medicine, and UTMB. The researchers 1st vaccinated the mice with 1 of the vaccines or a placebo. After mating, the animals were challenged with the virus 6 days into pregnancy. A week later, more than 50 percent of placentas and fetuses from mice administered the mRNA vaccine had virtually no Zika RNA. The remainder had \"substantially lower\" levels relative to placebo. The live vaccine provided broader protection: 78 percent of placentas and 83 percent of fetuses had Zika RNA at or below the level of detection, while the placebo group exhibited significantly higher levels of placental and fetal Zika RNA. Mice vaccinated with either vaccine had significantly higher rates of fetal viability; whereas 100 percent of fetuses from mice vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine were born, none survived to term in the placebo group.

The rash was considered an allergic reaction to the antibacterial and the HCW was admitted to the hospital inpatient clinic. Three days later, the HCW's child was admitted to hospital for a rash diagnosed as due to a non-communicable systemic disease. Subsequent serology showed that both the HCW and the child had measles. The origin of the infection for the index case is still unknown. It should be noted, however, that at least 10 community cases of measles occurred in the same period in the area of residence of the HCW. Using the standard case definition of the European Commission 3, a total of 34 measles cases during the following weeks were identified by tracing the contacts of the index case. Among them, 15 were HCWs, 5 were support personnel, 4 were hospital visitors and 11 were community contacts of the above cases. The secondary cases to the index (n = 8) occurred in 2 of the HCW's relatives, in 4 other HCWs, and in 2 support workers who were not immediately recognized as belonging to the hospital outbreak. One of the secondary cases, a HCW, was in service until the onset of symptoms, accessing all rooms on 2 inpatient wards. Tertiary cases (n = 6) involved the family of this HCW, 3 HCWs and a member of support personnel. A total of 2 weeks after the admission of the index case, 2 of the HCWs belonging to tertiary cases presented during the night to the ED where they stayed for nearly 10 hours. An additional 15 cases could be traced following this single exposure window, namely 7 HCWs, 2 support workers, 3 relatives of theirs and 3 visitors to the ED during the time the 2 HCWs were present. One more community case was related to contact outside hospital with one of the tertiary HCW cases. Additional cases were related to a visitor at one of the involved inpatient wards, who probably got in contact with one of the tertiary cases who were HCW during the incubation period and generated 3 cases in the community, among them a family pediatrician.

Sixteen were unvaccinated (2 children, 14 adults), 2 had received one dose, one a full course of 2 doses, and 5 cases occurred in contacts who received one dose of post-exposure vaccination. Of the 5 contacts who received post exposure vaccine, one was an infant younger than one year for whom information about the date of vaccination is not available; for the other 4, the delay between presumed contact date and immunization was 3 days in 2 cases, 6 and 12 days for the remaining 2 cases.

Among the 5 cases belonging to support personnel 2 were unvaccinated and the status was unknown for the remaining 3. Genotyping was available for 3 cases: genotype B3, subtype 3.1 was found in all of them.<br><br><strong> Conclusion and recommendations -</strong><br> Measles elimination in Europe, despite the immunization efforts, is still jeopardized by recurrent outbreaks in susceptible populations 4-7. Nosocomial transmission of measles is an important and emerging way of spreading the infection 8-11. Anyone staying in the hospital environment, regardless of role, can be affected because measles is highly contagious and persists in the environment for up to 2 hours, thus requiring appropriate and timely infection control measures 12,13. Considering that transmission may occur 3 days before the onset of rash, early diagnosis when only non-specific preliminary symptoms (cough, coryza and conjunctivitis) are present is crucial for containing the outbreak 14. A single exposure window, that occurred 2 weeks after the admission of the index case, when 2 cases were present in the ED, resulted in further 15 cases. Appropriate procedures are needed for patients with suspect transmissible infection in the ED, an issue not limited to measles but shared with several other highly infective conditions 13. A 2-dose vaccination is the most effective measure to prevent measles 15. This is of crucial importance for HCWs, with a view to their higher risk of exposure and of transmission to vulnerable patients. However, it should be noted that in at least 5 cases in this outbreak, measles occurred in personnel working in the hospital environment in support functions, highlighting the need to take into consideration the role of such personnel in the spread of the infection. Given that most of the support personnel belong to outsourced services, coordination is needed between occupational health unit and occupational health responsible of outsourced services.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail The full report can be found at the source URL. - Mod.ML There is no doubt that inadequate immunization levels are the major contributor to outbreaks of measles. Most of this is due to not receiving the 2 doses of vaccine due to personal or parenteral choice. Aggressive programs to reverse this unfortunate trend are needed to prevent outbreaks of this potentially lethal disease. The nosocomial setting as reflected in the 3rd post represents a special case situation. It is not clear why health care workers are not required to be immunized for measles. Additionally, when a case of measles is introduced into a health care facility, it has been my experience that the infection is not recognized promptly to minimize nosocomial spread. - Mod.LL   .

The doctors decided to transfer them to the hospital of infectious diseases, where they are receiving the appropriate treatment. The authorities will conduct an epidemiological investigation at their home, as it is believed that the 2 got sick after coming into contact with infected animals. Anthrax is a serious infectious disease caused by gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria known as _Bacillus anthracis_, according to information posted on the website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Although it is rare, people can get sick with anthrax if they come into contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products.

Corr.SB, edited In the midst of the health scandal of the eggs contaminated with fipronil coming from the Netherlands, the prefecture capital, Arras of Pas-de-Calais confirms analyses carried out in a French farm. All eggs laid on the farm since 28 Jul 2017 will be destroyed. In parallel, the northern prefecture confirmed today 9 Aug 2017 that a processor of egg products based in Roncq (Nord department) received a delivery of batches of contaminated eggs. New investigations are underway. The prefecture of Pas-de-Calais confirmed this Wed 9 Aug 2017 the presence of fipronil in a chicken farm with laying hens in the department. It is the 1st French farm in which traces of this insecticide, which caused the crisis of contaminated eggs that originated in the Netherlands, have been found. At the same time, the prefecture of the Nord department Lille also confirmed that a processing company the department is also involved: a processor of egg products based in Roncq was supplied with batches of contaminated eggs. According to the Pas-de-Calais prefecture, cited by 20 Minutes, the risk of contamination of the chickens has been linked to the use, by the operator, of a pest control product, DEGA-16, containing the banned substance. The site manager warned the authorities one of his suppliers was using DEGA-16, reports La Voix du Nord. Indeed, Chickfriend, the Belgian distributor of the product, illegally added fipronil to the composition of its antiparasitic drug, intended to eradicate the red louse. Pending the results of the analyzes, the eggs from this farm had been previously set aside and their sale suspended as a precaution, on 28 Jul 2017. As the results confirmed the presence of fipronil, these eggs will all be destroyed. As for the manufacturing company located in Roncq, the northern prefecture provides details this Wed 9 Aug 2017 on its site  ; in French. It said that it had been informed on 8 Aug 2017 that the processor of egg products, Ovoservices, had also \"shipped batches of contaminated eggs.\" The authorities have told our colleagues that the company \"immediately put in place the recall measures for destruction of the eggs so that they could not be sold to its customers.\" \"At the same time, the Departmental Directorate of Populations is conducting an investigation in each farm in the eggs sector of the department to ensure that the DEGA 16 has not been used,\" said the Nord prefecture. The investigations should make it possible to check \"the possible diffusion\" of the products from this plant, on French and European territories. This likely means the distribution of products from this plant. - Mod.TG Faced with the growing crisis, professionals in the sector are reassuring. Xavier Garenaux, president of the Licques Volaille poultry Defense Union of (Pas-de-Calais), reminds us that chickens intended for slaughter are killed too young to know about a possible treatment against the red louse. Most farmed chickens live only 35 to 40 days (81 days for Label Rouge chickens). Only the eggs, resulting from the farming of laying hens, would therefore be potentially affected by this health scandal.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. The WHO has set a very low level of fipronil in the eggs. While this article does not tell us the level of fipronil in the eggs, it is believed to be above the admissible limits. Without regard to the amount of fipronil in the eggs, it is possible there are happy chickens as they are no longer facing mites. - With current fipronil levels, Germany's Federal Institute for Risk Assessment estimates a child who weighs around 16 kg (35 lb) could eat 1.7 eggs per day without reaching the threshold where fipronil levels become dangerous. This includes products that contain egg, like pancakes or pasta. An adult who weights 65 kg (143 lb) could eat 7 eggs a day. The levels currently measured in contaminated eggs aren't very high and thus not dangerous for adults, however authorities and experts have advised parents to not let their children eat contaminated eggs ( ). Additionally, according to the UK Food Standards Agency ( ): \"Our risk assessment, based on all the information available, indicates that as part of a normal healthy diet this low level of potential exposure is unlikely to be a risk to public health and there is no need for consumers to be concerned. Our advice is that there is no need for people to change the way they consume or cook eggs or products containing eggs.\" So while fipronil is not approved for use in food producing animals, the agencies monitoring this situation have a risk assessment in place indicating the risk is low to consumers, but nevertheless are acting out of caution to protect them. - Mod.TG In addition to the detection of fipronil-contaminated eggs in France reported above, such findings have now been reported from several other European countries, including Romania, Sweden, Switzerland, Luxembourg, and the UK. One ton of contaminated egg yolk liquid was uncovered in Romania later on Thu 10 Aug 2017, according to the country's veterinary health authority ANSVSA. It was the 1st discovery of contaminated egg product in eastern Europe since the scandal erupted. The egg yolk liquid was found in a warehouse on the western side of the country and had been imported from Germany, but \"none of the product has been offered for sale,\" said ANSVSA. British authorities reported earlier on Thu 10 Aug 2017 that around 700 000 eggs from affected Dutch farms had been distributed in Britain. The UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) said the eggs were mixed in large batches to be used in processed foods and not sold fresh, as they were in countries like the Netherlands and Germany. 4 major British grocery chains have withdrawn such products, including sandwiches and salads, the FSA said in a statement. \"However, as this represents 0.007 per cent of the eggs we consume in the UK every year, it remains the case that it is very unlikely that there is any risk to public health from consuming these foods,\" the statement said. The FSA also said that the recalls were not being carried out owing to safety concerns, but because the ingredient is not authorized for use. Luxembourg said that eggs sold in the discount supermarket Aldi had been withdrawn after one batch was found to contain sufficient levels of fipronil to potentially pose a threat to young children, who cannot consume as much as adults safely. Aldi earlier this month August 2017 pulled all Dutch eggs from its stores in Germany, but the company said on Thu 10 Aug 2017 that its German markets would restock eggs as of Fri 11 Aug 2017. Police in the Netherlands have detained 2 men suspected of being involved in the illegal use of fipronil. Millions of fipronil-contaminated eggs have been recalled since the scandal broke.

Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world. A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries. Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years. \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\" \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea\". The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years 2 million DALYs since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln 13 million DALYs in the US, and 36-mln 36 million DALYs in Ethiopia. \"Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,\" continues Prof Melegaro \"our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population. Tailoring immunization campaigns to achieve measles eradication goals is essential and currently, for some countries, this means considering also the role of unprotected adolescents and young adults.

The increasing number of infectious diseases every year and the emergence of new diseases are a challenge for us to improve the prevention and control of the disease and to reduce the risk of structured and preventive measures before the diagnosis of infectious diseases. It impedes barriers to international trade and closes the export of livestock and their raw products and negatively affects the income and livelihoods of herders and the country, aimag provinces and soum districts economies. The final decision on the implementation of Phase 2 of the Mongolian Livestock Early Warning System was approved by the Prime Minister of Mongolia J. Erdenebat at the 21st International Economic Forum held in St. Petersburg, Russia. In June 2017, Minister of Agriculture and Light Industry P.

The 1st consignment, including 1 300 700 doses of the A&O vaccine has been received today (31 Jul 2017). Initial vaccination is planned to address sensitive and vulnerable animals in central and eastern regions in suspected and protected areas.

Mongolia reported to the OIE a new FMD outbreak, on its eastern region, on 13 Feb 2017. According to the report, the outbreak had started on 24 Jan 2017 and was confirmed on 28 Jan 2017, the causative agent being serotype O. One of the control measures undertaken was \"Vaccination in response to the outbreak,\" addressing cattle, sheep and goats. No information on the manufacturer of the vaccine used or on the vaccine strain included in the applied vaccine, became available. This may have been a different manufacturer, namely not the (current) Russian one. Genotyping of the January 2017 strain from Mongolia was carried out at Pirbright (WRLFMD), indicating that the causative agent in 2017 was serotype O, topotype ME-SA, lineage \"PanAsia\" (see, including a dendogram and most closely related prototype sequences, at  ). Clearly, as apparent from the recent media reports, FMD has widely spread in Mongolia, from the east westwards and northwards. The following information on Mongolia's FMD situation was published in page 7 of EUFMD's Global Monthly report for June 2017, available at  : \"FMDV serotypes A and O were detected in 10 of the 16 samples collected between March 2015 and April 2017, of which one was from a sheep and the remaining from cattle. \"Genotyping of the VP1 of the detected viruses identified the following lineages: A/ASIA/SEA-97, and O/SEA/Mya-98, and O/ME-SA/PanAsia.

Among the 26 newly reported cases, 13 are associated with a cluster in a hospital in Al Jawf Region, Saudi Arabia. The initial case was a 51-year-old reported on Wed 2 Aug 2017. To date, 12 cases have been identified through contact tracing. These cases include 8 health care workers (all asymptomatic) in the hospital where the initial case was treated, one hospital contact (a 70-year-old male) and 3 household contacts. Follow up of health care workers, hospital and household contacts are ongoing. Globally, 2066 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including at least 720 related deaths have been reported to WHO. Public health response The Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia evaluates each case and their contacts and implements measures to limit further human-to-human transmission and bring Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks under control. The measures taken by Ministry of Health officials in Saudi Arabia include:  - Risk stratification and active tracing for contacts in healthcare and in communities. High risk contacts (e.g. unprotected exposure to a case or engagement in an aerosol generating procedure) are tested by PCR regardless of having symptoms. Health care workers are exempted from work until they are cleared by infection control experts.  - Trained hospital epidemiologists have been deployed to sites within 24 hours of identifying an outbreak.  - Enforcement of strict adherence to environmental disinfection and terminal cleaning of affected areas.  - Enforcement of visual triage for respiratory diseases in emergency department and outpatient departments and ensuring the 24/7 availability of trained nurses for early detection of patients with respiratory symptoms, and proper documentation on triage forms.  - Extensive training of all health care workers on case definition for early detection, implementation of isolation precautions, proper selection, donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE), hand hygiene and environmental cleaning and disinfection.  - Ensuring availability of infection prevention supplies including hand sanitizer, PPEs, surface disinfectants, portable HEPA filters and fumigation machines.  - Ensuring that all health care workers are fit tested for high efficiency respirators.  - Implementing the policy of not allowing health care personnel working in a facility affected by an outbreak to travel or work in Hajj premises or in any healthcare facility until they are medical cleared. WHO risk assessment MERS-CoV causes severe human infections resulting in high mortality and has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings. The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals or animal products (for example, following contact with dromedaries) or human source (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information. WHO advice Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures. Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, in addition to avoiding close contact with suspected or confirmed human cases of the disease, people with these conditions should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp In summary, according to the WHO update, as of Sat 12 Aug 2017, there have been a total of 2066 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported to WHO, including at least 720 related deaths (reported case fatality rate 34.8 percent). In the period covered by the above update (4 Jul - 12 Aug 2017), there were 26 newly confirmed laboratory confirmed infections with the MERS-CoV including 8 asymptomatic infections associated with the outbreak in Dawmet Aljandal (Asir region). In addition to the 6 fatalities among these 26 newly confirmed infections, official recovery reports from the MOH were available for cases no. 1 (on Tue 11 Jul 2017), no. 3 (on Mon 31 Jul 2017), no 5 (on Thu 17 Aug 2017), and no. 9 (Tue 15 Aug 2017). Classifications of the 26 cases reported by the MOH included: A total of 8 primary cases with high risk exposures still under investigation (cases nos. 1, 2, 3, 7, 11, 20, 21, and 26) One primary case with no known high risk exposure (case no. 6) Up to 4 primary cases with contact with camels (3 direct contact, one indirect contact  cases nos. 4, 5, 8 and 12) A total of 8 secondary healthcare associated cases in healthcare workers (cases nos. 10, 15, 16, 17, 22, 23, 24, and 25) One secondary healthcare associated case in a patient (case no.19) Up to 4 secondary cases in household contacts (cases nos. 9, 13, 14 and 18) According to the WHO update, case no. 11 had a history of contact with camels that was not known at the time of the MOH report. Interpretation of the details above is that outside of the outbreak in Asir region, the pattern of transmission was primarily sporadic cases, around the country, the majority of whom were classified as primary cases with unidentified high risk exposures (8 out of 13) and the remaining 5 cases had a history of known contact with camels and camel products in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. So the question remains, what is the high risk exposure that is not being identified? .......- Mod.MPP ","keywordsMatched":[]},"367":{"title":"MERS-CoV (49): Saudi Arabia, new cases ","date":["31","Jul","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH/EDR> MERS-CoV (49): Saudi Arabia, new cases [EXTERNAL]","summary":"   Thu 27 Jul 2017 Source: Saudi MOH 28 Jul - 2 Aug 2017 edited As of today Wed 2 Aug 2017, there have been a total of: 1680 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including 681 deaths reported case fatality rate 40.5 per cent, 987 recoveries, and 11 currently active cases/infections.

In the 11 day period since the last update, there have been 7 newly confirmed cases reported of whom 5 were from Dawmat Aljandal (Al Jawf region), the location that had nosocomial transmission identified since the beginning of this past month July 2017. Clearly transmission is continuing in this area, with 3 newly confirmed secondary cases in household contacts - at least 2 of whom were identified through screening of asymptomatic household contacts, and 2 additional cases in which high risk exposures are still under investigation. We do not know if these household contacts are associated with the earlier identified transmission chain in Dawmat Aljandal or if these are newly identified chains of transmission. The other 2 newly confirmed cases involve \"sporadic\" cases - an individual in Hail whose high risk exposure history is still under investigation, and an individual from Alaflaj (Riyadh region) with a history of direct contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. As to be expected, concern is being voiced on the international level with the upcoming Hajj and this recent increase in cases reported both in Saudi Arabia and in the UAE. We now have gone through 5 Hajj periods since the identification of the MERS-CoV and to date there have been no cases of MERS-CoV infection identified in returning Hajjis. The case in the UAE (see section 1 above) actually had onset of illness over 1 month ago with no secondary cases/infections identified among known contacts of this case. As for the cases in Saudi Arabia, and more specifically the Hajj, population movement is very well defined during the Hajj, no camels are permitted in the areas where Hajjis are congregated, and there are Hajj specific health services that are separate from those that are available for the general Saudi population, all factors that are reducing the likelihood of Hajjis having inadvertent (or intentional) high risk exposures. Hopefully my optimism is well placed and we will pass through a 6th Hajj period without impact on international transmission of the MERS-CoV associated with this Hajj. - Mod.MPP ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Senegal":{"62":{"title":"Zika virus (16): Americas, Asia, research,\r\n\tobservations ","date":["17","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Zika virus (16): Americas, Asia, research,\r\n\tobservations [EXTERNAL]","summary":" 11 _Culex quinquefasciatus_ as vectors  Wed 9 Aug 2017 Source: Emerging Microbes & Infections edited ref: Guedes DR, Paiva MH, Donato MM, et al.

Emerg Microbes Infect. 2017; 6(8): e69. doi: 10.1038/emi.2017.<br><br><strong>59  Abstract </strong><br> Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has recently been associated with an increased incidence of neonatal microcephaly and other neurological disorders. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito bite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some cases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main vector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other mosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the virus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit ZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of laboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. Interestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the midgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in Recife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially fed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx. quinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced. Collectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range of ZIKV vectors than anticipated.  <br><br>Communicated by: Roland Hübner Superior Health Council Brussels Belgium Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active virus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their ability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step toward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_ fed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in saliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing. The study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a competent vector.

The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito bite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some cases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main vector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other mosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the virus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit ZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of laboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. Interestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the midgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in Recife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially fed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx. quinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced. Collectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range of ZIKV vectors than anticipated.  <br><br>Communicated by: Roland Hübner Superior Health Council Brussels Belgium Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active virus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their ability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step toward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_ fed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in saliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing. The study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a competent vector.

Zika virus (or Zika) has been reported in Singapore. Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in Singapore are infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:  Women who are pregnant:  Do not travel to Singapore.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to Singapore or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers considering pregnancy:  Before you or your partner travel, talk to your health care provider about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection.  Wait before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.  If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex &ndash; or do not have sex &ndash; for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex, or do not have sex, for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy  Talk to your health care provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you&rsquo;re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Wait at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  Men are advised to wait longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.gov  Contact CDC  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  1600 Clifton Road  Atlanta ,  GA  30329-4027  USA  800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)  Contact CDC-INFO  TOP","keywordsMatched":[]},"502":{"title":"Measles update (43): Asia and Pacific, Europe, demographics\r\n\t","date":["26","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Measles update (43): Asia and Pacific, Europe, demographics\r\n\t[EXTERNAL]","summary":"<br><br><strong> Measles immunity gaps -</strong><br> 5 Role of demographics  Sat 26 Aug 2017 Source: News-Medical/Life Sciences edited Even if the incidence of measles infection has decreased by at least 90 per cent worldwide since the introduction of the vaccine, measles is still one of the major causes of death in children among vaccine-preventable diseases. Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world. A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries. Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years. \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\" \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea\". The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years 2 million DALYs since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln 13 million DALYs in the US, and 36-mln 36 million DALYs in Ethiopia. \"Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,\" continues Prof Melegaro \"our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population. Tailoring immunization campaigns to achieve measles eradication goals is essential and currently, for some countries, this means considering also the role of unprotected adolescents and young adults.

BoNTs prevent neurotransmitter release and lead to a flaccid paralysis. There are 3 main forms of human botulism: food-borne, wound and infant botulism 1,2. The BoNTs are produced by 6 phylogenetically and physiologically distinct bacteria (_Clostridium botulinum_ Groups I-IV, and strains of _C. baratii_ and _C. butyricum_) which are so diverse as to merit classification as different species. All of the BoNT-producing _Clostridium_ species have non BoNT-producing counterparts (not harboring the BoNT gene cluster) which are often assigned to different species names, such as _C. sporogenes_ for _C. botulinum_ Group I strains 2. This polyphyly of _C. botulinum_ together with its close relationship to non-toxigenic species can result either in the erroneous detection of toxigenic _Clostridium_ species or failure thereof. The BoNT gene cluster is often associated with mobile genetic elements, allowing for interconversion between toxigenic and nontoxigenic _Clostridium_ species, and leading to substantial variation in BoNT sequences and their genomic backgrounds 3. Today, the BoNT serotypes are divided into more than 40 subtypes, including BoNT/A1 to BoNT/A8 4, and mosaic forms 5. The BoNT diversity at the amino acid level can reach up to 36 percent within a serotype and is reflected by differences in their catalytic activity, receptor binding or pharmacokinetics 6. In addition to containing the gene for BoNT, the BoNT gene cluster contains the gene for the non-toxic non-haemagglutinin (NTNH) protein. The BoNT gene cluster also harbors either 3 hemagglutinin (HA) genes (ha1, ha2 and ha3) in the HA cluster or 3 orfX genes (orfX1, orfX2 and orfX3) in the orfX cluster. Together with BoNT, these accessory proteins can form complexes of varying size and composition 7. The variability observed in BoNTs due to the existence of 7 serotypes, mosaic forms, several different subtypes and the occurrence of BoNT in different complexes, as well as their heterogeneous genetic background are probably the main reasons for the spectrum of clinical presentations and disease duration associated with botulism, and pose a tremendous challenge to diagnostic laboratories 8. Botulism is associated with a wide variety of foods that are rich in protein and kept under the partial exclusion of oxygen, or in an environment where oxygen has been depleted by other bacteria. Marinated meat, fish, fruits, vegetables or mushrooms as well as home-canned products and home-cured or smoked meat or fish products, which are consumed unheated, are particularly known sources. BoNTs are heat-labile and can be destroyed by temperatures above 70 C 158 F in minutes 9,10. Nowadays, foodborne botulism is almost exclusively associated with home-produced foods, but commercial food products are occasionally involved in single cases or small outbreaks 11-13. Between 2010-2014, ECDC reported 492 cases in Europe 14, with the last case occurring in Slovakia in 2012 15.<br><br><strong> The event -</strong><br> In mid-August 2015 (day 0), an otherwise healthy adult in their 40s consumed, for dinner, 3 packs (100 g each) 3.52 ounces of a commercial hummus spread. The hummus, which was sold in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, had a best-before date of 9 days after consumption. The following morning (day 1), 9-11 hours after consumption of the hummus, the patient experienced nausea, vomiting, double vision, unsteady gait, dizziness, generalized weakness and difficulties swallowing, and was admitted to hospital. Despite receiving 3 doses of equine trivalent anti-A, B and E antitoxin, the patient felt into a coma on day 2 and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). As botulism is a mandatory notifiable disease in Slovakia, the clinic reported the suspected botulism case to local health authorities. A gastric lavage, but neither serum nor stool, was taken on day 2 and stored at 4 C 39.2 F for further analysis. After one week of storage, the gastric lavage was sent to the Public Health Institute in Ostrava, Czech Republic where it tested negative by mouse bioassay. Treatment consisted mainly of intensive symptomatic care and respiratory support for almost 50 days. The patient was discharged from hospital after 78 days, but still complained about breathing problems as of their last follow-up in May 2017.<br><br><strong> Methods: Epidemiological investigation -</strong><br> On day one, after being notified by the clinic, the regional health authorities started an epidemiological investigation by interviewing the hospitalized patient. The next day, day 2, the patient's household was inspected to check for additional cases and to collect food samples. There, a close relative who shares the same household was interviewed, a list of food items consumed by the patient over the last days was recorded and suspicious food items were collected. In cooperation with the Slovak State Veterinary and Food Administration (SVPS), an investigation on the composition and the origin of the ingredients used for production of the hummus was conducted at the food processing facility.<br><br><strong> Laboratory investigation </strong><br> Isolation of _Clostridium botulinum_ from hummus and molecular analysis. Small particles of hummus left on the packaging of the 3 nearly empty hummus tubes were streaked on tryptic soy agar and Schaedler agar plates, and subjected to anaerobic culture at 37 C 98.6 F in anaerobic jars following EN ISO 7937:2005. Almost all colonies showed typical clostridia-like morphology and were probed for the presence of bont genes with a multiplex PCR for bont/A, bont/B, bont/E and bont/F 16 according to CEN ISO/TS 17919:2013. Genetic analysis Isolates were transferred to the Consultant laboratory for neurotoxin-producing clostridia (botulism, tetanus), formerly called the Consultant Laboratory for _Clostridium botulinum_, at the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) in Berlin, Germany for further molecular biological investigation. Isolates were grown in tryptone-peptone-glucose-yeast extract (TPGY) medium at 32 C 89.6 F in an anaerobic workstation (MG500, Don Whitley, Shipley, United Kingdom), and tested for the presence of bont/A-G by single and multiplex quantitative PCR 17. In addition, a quantitative PCR was used to test for the ntnh gene as a surrogate marker for BoNT-producing _Clostridium spp._ 18. To further investigate the composition of the BoNT gene cluster, a set of 6 conventional PCRs targeting the 3 ha genes and the 3 orfX genes was applied 19. Toxin production in supernatants was confirmed by in-house ELISA tests as described 20,21. The 16S rRNA and bont/A gene sequences were obtained by Sanger sequencing 22. Sequences were assembled and compared with the GenBank database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information in the United States via Geneious software packages (Biomatters Limited, Auckland, New Zealand) using the BLAST algorithm 23. For subtyping, the amino acid sequence of the BoNT was compared with the 8 known BoNT/A subtypes 4. Sequences of the other BoNT/A subtypes were uploaded into Geneious and pairwise identities of the aligned sequences were calculated using the MAFFT algorithm 24. For comparison, the BoNT subtypes of the following BoNT strains causing food-borne botulism in the past (except for BoNT/A4 which originated from an infant botulism case) were selected (GenBank accession numbers in parenthesis): BoNT/A1 (HA cluster) strain ATCC3502 (AM412317); BoNT/A1 (orfX cluster) strain NCTC2916 (X52066); BoNT/A2 (orfX cluster) strain Mascarpone (DQ310546); BoNT/A3 (orfX cluster) strain Loch Maree (CP000963); BoNT/A4 (orfX cluster) strain 657 (EU341307); BoNT/A5 (HA cluster) strain 1430.11 (KC683799); BoNT/A6 (orfX cluster) strain CDC41370 (FJ981696); BoNT/A7 (unknown cluster) strain 2008-148 (JQ954969); BoNT/A8 (orfX cluster) strain Chemnitz (KM233166). Further microbiological investigation In order to identify additional possibly contaminated products of the same production date, the Regional Authority of Public Health (RAPH) in Banska Bystrica investigated the products' availability at several local supermarkets and the food bank. While no additional hummus was available from the food bank, 3 tubes of hummus with the same production date as the ones consumed were obtained from a supermarket. Unopened products were stored at 37 C 98.6 F for several days to reach suitable conditions for _C. botulinum_/_C. sporogenes_ germination and growth.<br><br><strong> Results -</strong><br> Epidemiological investigation: Results from the interview revealed that on day 0, the patient alone ate scrambled eggs for breakfast; the patient, a close relative and a friend shared the same meal of mushrooms in cream sauce with pasta for lunch; and the patient alone ate the hummus at dinner after obtaining it from a food bank. The interview of the patient and a close relative revealed that one tube of the hummus product showed gas production prior to being opened, but it tasted normal according to the patient. The epidemiologists notified the Regional Veterinary and Food Administration of the Slovak Republic and the 3 nearly empty tubes of hummus and 2 unopened packs of a commercial ready-to-eat sauerkraut and vegetarian sausage meal, from the same company as the hummus, were sent for laboratory investigation. Neither the scrambled eggs nor the pasta dish were available for sampling. An investigation at the producing company revealed that the hummus product consisted of the following ingredients: chick peas, tofu, rapeseed oil, onion, salt, maize starch and spices. It also revealed that the chick peas originated from Brazil or Argentina. Laboratory investigation: RAPH received the collected food items, including the 3 opened and nearly empty 100 g 3.52 ounces hummus tubes. Three strains with typical _C. botulinum_ morphology (designated Banska Bystrica, RAPH1223j and RAPH1224) were isolated, one from each tube. Two of them, Banska Bystrica and RAPH1223j, were PCR-positive for the bont/A gene. The vegetarian sausage and sauerkraut meal tested negative for the presence of _C. botulinum_ and the bont/A gene. On day 7, as soon as the 1st results were available, the hummus was withdrawn from the market and a Food and Feed Safety Alert was issued through the European Commission's Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF). The 3 unopened hummus tubes with the same production date that were obtained from a supermarket were subjected to 37 C 98.6 F storage. Microbiological analysis and PCR testing did not reveal the presence of _C. botulinum_ or _C. sporogenes_ despite some signs of gas formation during storage. Molecular biological characterisation of isolated strains: The sequences of the 16S rRNA gene analysed at RKI revealed that all 3 isolates (strains Banska Bystrica, RAPH1223j and RAPH1224) belonged to _C. botulinum_ Group I/_C. sporogenes_ (greater than 99 percent identity), which are almost indistinguishable at the 16S rRNA sequence level 2,25. The presence of bont/A and ntnh genes was confirmed by quantitative PCR, and expression of the toxin was shown by an in-house ELISA for isolates Banska Bystrica and RAPH1223j. From the 2 BoNT/A-positive isolates, the BoNT/A sequences were obtained and compared with GenBank entries at the nucleotide (nt) and the amino acid level. Both toxigenic isolates (Banska Bystrica and RAPH1223j) were found to harbor a bont/A gene of identical sequence; the bont/A sequence of one strain, Banska Bystrica, was submitted to GenBank under accession number KU376389. It showed the highest identity (greater than or equal to 99.6 percent) to bont/A sequences of the unusual subtype BoNT/A3. Table one shows the distances computed against all BoNT/A subtypes at the nt and the amino acid levels for Table, see original URL - Mod.LL. Compared with the prototype BoNT/A1, the BoNT of the new BoNT/A-positive isolates, Banska Bystrica and RAPH1223j, had an identity at the amino acid level of only 84.6 percent (compared with BoNT/A1 strain ATCC3502; HA cluster) or 84.5 percent (compared with BoNT/A1 strain NCTC2916; orfX cluster). Similar low amino acid level identities (between 84.3 percent and 87.7 percent) were found when compared with BoNT subtypes A4-A8, whereas amino acid level identity with subtype A2 (strain Mascarpone) was 92.9 percent. Sequence identities at the nt level were generally higher, but still diverged by up to 8.5 percent. Both isolates (Banska Bystrica and RAPH1223j) were negative for the ha1, ha2 and ha3 genes and positive for the orfX1, orfX2 and orfX3 genes by PCR; this is in agreement with the BoNT/A3 strain Loch Maree in which the bont/A gene is located in the orfX cluster.<br><br><strong> Discussion </strong><br> Our laboratory investigations support the diagnosis of a case of foodborne botulism caused by the unusual BoNT subtype A3 in food consumed by the patient. To our knowledge, this is only the 2nd time that this subtype was involved in foodborne botulism since 8 people died from contaminated wild duck paste in Loch Maree, Scotland in 1922 26. No other strain belonging to this specific A3 subtype was isolated or subtyped for nearly a century until Luquez and colleagues identified 3 strains from Argentina (in soil and salad) in 2012 27. Interestingly, the 2 described BoNT/A-positive isolates have an identical BoNT/A sequence at the amino acid level as one of the strains (CDC54054) isolated from Argentinian soil 27, and the chick peas used in the hummus consumed by the patient originated from South America, either from Brazil or Argentina. Initially, suspected botulism could not be confirmed by testing the gastric lavage taken on day 2. Considering the acidity and proteolytic activity, as well as the length of storage, the gastric lavage taken after emesis on day one was not an ideal sample. Serum and stool samples, which have been proposed to be the most reliable samples for diagnostic testing 28, might not have been collected, because of a lack of testing facilities and inexperienced clinical personnel, particularly since botulism is a rare disease and no cases have been notified in Slovakia since 2012 15. For the clinician, it is important to consider the optimal timing when choosing samples for botulism diagnosis. Despite demonstration of BoNT in serum as one of the key tests to confirm botulism, the time period in which BoNT can be detected from serum is usually limited to the 1st few days after oral ingestion. However, confirmation of BoNT-producing _Clostridium_ species (spores) from feces can often be achieved over a more prolonged period (up to two weeks) 28,29. Therefore, co-examination of serum and stool is recommended to confirm clinical cases of food-borne botulism 28-31. The mere detection of _C. botulinum_ from feces without clinical symptoms does not imply the presence of botulism given that _C. botulinum spores_ are not usually detected in the feces of healthy humans. However, on rare occasions, spores that have been ingested with naturally contaminated food (e.g. honey, fresh vegetables) might be detected in the feces of otherwise healthy people 28. In our case, foodborne botulism could only be confirmed by the isolation of _C. botulinum_ from 2 of the 3 consumed tubes of hummus. It is always hard to exclude that the analyzed food become cross-contaminated in the household with _C. botulinum_ by handling with kitchen utensils contaminated via another food. However, there was no indication that the hummus became cross-contaminated within the patient's household. In the aftermath of the current botulism case, 3 unopened hummus tubes with the same production date were subjected to 37 C 98.6 F storage and analyzed for the presence of _C. botulinum_ without any positive result. It is not unusual that _C. botulinum_ cannot be detected from other items of the same lot. In 3 botulism outbreaks in Europe in 2011, which involved commercial olive tapenade, almond-stuffed olives and korma sauce, _C. botulinum_ and BoNT could only be identified from one or 2 opened jars/pots obtained from the households, but not from any unopened jars/pots from the same lot (consisting of 60, 900, and 1836 items, respectively) that were tested 11,32-34. These cases indicate that even in modern industrialized food production, contamination of a single or a very few items within a lot cannot be completely excluded. In all those cases, consumer protection had utmost priority and food recalls were issued solely on the basis of positive results from the remaining product in the open containers from the affected households to prevent a potential spread of the disease 32-34. Hummus has been involved in a foodborne botulism outbreak in the past, possibly due to incorrect storage temperature 35 C 95 F. Whether this was the case in the event presented here could not be determined, but the patient did notice gas formation in the products. This might be indicative of spoilage as growth of _C. botulinum_ in spoiled products is often associated with gas production, e.g. foaming, bulging of cans 36. However, unlike Group II strains of _C. botulinum_ which can grow at refrigeration temperatures, Group I strains (to which this study's isolated strains belong) require growth temperatures above 10 C 50 F 2. This suggests that the hummus product was at least partially stored above refrigeration temperatures. Compared with the known 8 BoNT/A subtypes (BoNT/A1 to BoNT/A8 4), the subtype A3 is both very rare and the most distant from the prototype BoNT/A1 (Table 1), being up to 15.4 percent and 8 percent different at the amino acid and nt level, respectively. Notably, because of its amino acid sequence divergence, BoNT/A3 is known to be neutralized less efficiently by polyclonal antibodies generated against BoNT/A1 37. This has led us to speculate that the long lasting neurological effects observed in the patient despite the administration of 3 doses of trivalent antitoxin might at least be partially due to suboptimal neutralization by the antitoxin, which is directed against BoNT/A1. The rareness and divergence of the BoNT/A3 subtype poses the risk that it might not be detected by immunological or sequence-based diagnostic assays that have not been validated against it. In fact, one ELISA has already been shown to be unable to detect it 38. Furthermore, in one 39 of the 4 mentioned PCR methods in ISO ISO/TS 17919:2013, the sequence of one primer and the probe each contain one mismatch towards all BoNT/A3 sequences. These mismatches might therefore hamper identification of strains belonging to the A3 subtype by the corresponding PCR 40,41. Testing laboratories should be aware that strains harboring this rare subtype can occur in European countries and are advised to validate their methods accordingly. Unfortunately, the exchange of BoNT-producing strains and in some instances, even the sharing of their sequence information are restricted because of their nature as possible biowarfare agents and other dual-use concerns 42,43.<br><br><strong> Conclusion </strong><br> Rare and novel BoNT sequence variation can especially easily escape detection by sequence-based or immunological methods. As more sequences become available despite some restrictions, diagnostic facilities should check their PCRs frequently to ensure inclusion of all known sequence variations. As a result of the rareness of botulism, many laboratories have no or only individual assays for detection at hand. Specialized laboratories (e.g. national reference laboratories or consultant laboratories) able to apply a broader range of methods could aid those laboratories, but are often not easily identifiable by the laboratories responsible for testing the samples.

The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam.

Two vaccination campaigns are planned for both Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa governorates. If there is geographic spread, the extent of these campaigns will have to be adjusted. - The 1st mOPV2 round in Deir ez-Zor was successfully carried out between 22-26 Jul 2017. Independent post-campaign monitoring reflected coverage of 88.4 percent (based on caregiver recall). The 2nd round is planned for 19-23 Aug 2017, and will include mOPV2 and IPV. - Raqqa Governorate started mOPV2 campaigns on 12 Aug 2017. - Plans are being finalized to mitigate the risks of further spread from the outbreak zone to neighbouring areas and countries, including immunization of at-risk populations in northwest Syria, Turkey and Lebanon.

That being said, there have only been 9 confirmed cases of WPV1 associated paralytic disease worldwide this year (2017), compared with 37 cases reported last year (2016). In contrast there have been 40 confirmed cases of cVDPV2 confirmed this year (2017) compared with 5 last year (2016). As a reminder, outbreaks due to cVDPV's are considered as significant in the big picture of polio eradication, as they are due to vaccine polioviruses that have reverted in neurovirulence following passage through multiple individuals while circulating in the susceptible population. The goal of the polio eradication initiative is to interrupt transmission of both the WPV's and the cVDPVs. The presence of cVDPVs occurs when there are areas with low vaccination coverage where the vaccine virus (from the OPV) can continue circulating through the susceptible population. - Mod.MPP ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Somaliland":{"5":{"title":"Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (84): Africa ","date":["15","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (84): Africa [EXTERNAL]","summary":" 5 Cholera - Somalia: (Somaliland Autonomous Region)  Mon 7 Aug 2017 Source: ITV News edited MA is 4 years old, but he looks less than half that.

The 4 cases were reported in Helderberg in the Western Cape. The patients include a mother and 2 children and a neighbor. It is not published who died. Professor Lucille Blumberg with the NICD said it was likely the infected children did not receive all their vaccines. Diphtheria is a dangerous respiratory disease that is caused by a potent toxin produced by certain strains of the bacterium _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_. Diphtheria is extremely contagious through coughing or sneezing. Risk factors include crowding, poor hygiene, and lack of immunization. Symptoms usually appear within a week of infection. This infection is characterized by a sore throat, coughing, and fever very similar to many common diseases like strep throat. Additional symptoms may be bloody, watery discharge from the nose and rapid breathing. However, a presumptive diagnosis can be made by observing a characteristic thick grayish patch (membrane) found in the throat. In more severe cases, neck swelling, and airway obstruction may be observed. In the tropics, cutaneous and wound diphtheria is much more common and can be a source of transmission. The real serious danger is when the toxin that is produced by the bacterium gets into the bloodstream and spreads to organs like the heart and nervous system. Myocarditis, congestive heart failure, and neurological illnesses of paralysis that mimic Guillain-Barré syndrome are most severe. Even with treatment, fatalities are still seen in up to 10 percent of cases. Diphtheria can be treated and cured successfully with antitoxin and antimicrobials if started early enough. The prevention of diphtheria is through vaccination. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ The following is extracted from  : \"Diphtheria takes its name from the Greek word dipthera meaning leather and was named in 1826 by French physician Pierre Bretonneau. This is because it refers to the leathery, sheath-like membrane that grows on the tonsils, throat, and in the nose. It was previously considered to be one of the most dreaded diseases, with frequent large-scale outbreaks in the New England colonies between 1735 and 1740. It was said that the disease killed as many as 80 per cent of the children below 10 years of age. Diphtheria is otherwise called the \"Strangling Angel of Children\" and was a dreaded common childhood illness. Statistics show that in the 1920s, there were an estimated 100 000 to 200 000 cases of diphtheria per year in the USA, with 13 000 to 15 000 deaths.\" The following was extracted from  : \"_C. diphtheriae_ is an aerobic Gram-positive bacillus. Toxin production (toxigenicity) occurs only when the bacillus is itself infected (lysogenized) by a specific virus (bacteriophage) carrying the genetic information for the toxin (tox gene). Only toxigenic strains can cause severe disease. Culture of the organism requires selective media containing tellurite. If isolated, the organism must be distinguished in the laboratory from other _Corynebacterium_ species that normally inhabit the nasopharynx and skin (such as diphtheroids). _C. diphtheriae_ has 4 biotypes: gravis, intermedius, mitis and belfanti. The most severe disease is associated with the gravis biotype, but any strain may produce toxin. All isolates of _C. diphtheriae_ should be tested by the laboratory for toxigenicity. \"Susceptible persons may acquire toxigenic diphtheria bacilli in the nasopharynx. The organism produces a toxin that inhibits cellular protein synthesis and is responsible for local tissue destruction and membrane formation. The toxin produced at the site of the membrane is absorbed into the bloodstream and then distributed to the tissues of the body. The toxin is responsible for the major complications of myocarditis and neuritis and can also cause low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia) and protein in the urine (proteinuria). Clinical disease associated with non-toxin-producing strains is generally milder. While rare severe cases have been reported, these may actually have been caused by toxigenic strains that were not detected because of inadequate culture sampling. \"The incubation period of diphtheria is 2-5 days (range, 1-10 days). Disease can involve almost any mucous membrane. For clinical purposes, it is convenient to classify diphtheria into a number of manifestations, depending on the site of disease. The most common sites of diphtheria infection are the pharynx and the tonsils. Infection at these sites is usually associated with substantial systemic absorption of toxin. The onset of pharyngitis is insidious. Early symptoms include malaise, sore throat, anorexia, and low-grade fever. Within 2-3 days, a bluish-white membrane forms and extends, varying in size from covering a small patch on the tonsils to covering most of the soft palate. Often by the time a physician is contacted, the membrane is greyish-green, or black if bleeding has occurred. There is a minimal amount of mucosal erythema surrounding the membrane. The membrane is adherent to the tissue, and forcible attempts to remove it cause bleeding. Extensive membrane formation may result in respiratory obstruction. \"The patient may recover at this point; or if enough toxin is absorbed, develop severe prostration, striking pallor, rapid pulse, stupor, and coma, and may even die within 6 to 10 days. Fever is usually not high, even though the patient may appear quite toxic. Patients with severe disease may develop marked edema of the submandibular areas and the anterior neck along with lymphadenopathy, giving a characteristic \"bull neck\" appearance. \"Most complications of diphtheria, including death, are attributable to effects of the toxin. The severity of the disease and complications are generally related to the extent of local disease. The toxin, when absorbed, affects organs and tissues distant from the site of invasion. The most frequent complications of diphtheria are myocarditis and neuritis. Myocarditis may present as abnormal cardiac rhythms and can occur early in the course of the illness or weeks later, and can lead to heart failure. If myocarditis occurs early, it is often fatal. Neuritis most often affects motor nerves and usually resolves completely. Paralysis of the soft palate is most frequent during the 3rd week of illness. Paralysis of eye muscles, limbs, and diaphragm can occur after the 5th week. Secondary pneumonia and respiratory failure may result from diaphragmatic paralysis. Other complications include otitis media and respiratory insufficiency due to airway obstruction, especially in infants.\" - Mod.LL ","keywordsMatched":[]},"48":{"title":"Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (86): Africa,\r\n\tAsia ","date":["18","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (86): Africa,\r\n\tAsia [EXTERNAL]","summary":" 4 Cholera - Pakistan (Punjab Province)  Wed 16 Aug 2017 Source: The News edited The number of cases of cholera, a highly contagious and fatal disease is continuously on the rise and there is a threat that spread of the infection may take shape of an epidemic if proper preventive and control measures are not taken well in time. The 1st 2 cases of cholera were tested positive by National Institute of Health Islamabad on Mon 31 Jul 2017 and another 2 confirmed positive for the infection on Fri 4 Aug 2017. All the 4 patients were undergoing treatment at Benazir Bhutto Hospital BH where as many as 4 more suspects of the infection have been admitted for treatment. Data collected by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017 reveals that the allied hospitals have sent stool samples of over 10 child patients to NIH for confirmation of cholera in last week week of Sun 6 Aug 2017. On Sat 12 Aug 2017, as many as 20 child patients with severe diarrhoea were admitted at the BBH of which 4 were suspected as patients of cholera and their stool samples were sent to NIH for confirmation, said Associate Professor of Paediatrics at Rawalpindi Medical University Dr Tariq Saeed when contacted by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017. He added the hospital has not received confirmation reports from the NIH because of holidays there from Saturday to Monday. However, we have been keeping the suspects in isolation under strict monitoring, he said. He added that repeated rainfalls in the region and water inundation inside and outside homes in a number of localities particularly in thickly populated areas of the city are causing contamination of water and foodstuff that increases chances of spread of a number of infections among population while children are at greater risk of contracting life-threatening infections including cholera. It is important that the transmission of cholera occurs primarily by drinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the feces (waste product) of an infected person, including one with no apparent symptoms. It is observed that heavy rainfall causes collection of heavily contaminated water in streets and houses and the waste water flooding out of various nullahs watercourses including Nullah Leh in town causes infections including cholera, typhoid, dysentery, gastroenteritis, hepatitis A and E, shigellosis and giardiasis. Professor Tariq said the consumption of contaminated water and foodstuff causes cholera, an infection in the small intestine caused by bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. Its main symptoms are watery diarrhea and vomiting that can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, and death in cases which are not treated in time, he said. Health experts say that to avoid cholera and other infections, one must use boiled water for drinking and should use vegetables after washing with clean water and it must be kept in mind that raw vegetables should not be eaten in the existing weather conditions instead these should be used after cooking. To a query, Professor Tariq said the heavy rainfall and water accumulation may contaminate water at sources and there may be chances of contamination of water at tube wells so individuals must boil water before drinking to avoid cholera and other infections. He added the appearance of cholera is alarming and it is time for people to take extra ordinary preventive measures to safeguard their children and themselves from the disease. In case water is accumulated inside home due to heavy rainfall and flooded out of sewage lines, it must be wiped out immediately and the space should be washed with clean water as soon as possible to avoid infections. Avoiding inundation of contaminated water inside homes is a must to avoid cholera and other infections, said Professor Tariq.

Shipped from Amsterdam to Miami after participating in Sweden and UK An American dressage horse returning to the United States after a competition tour in Europe could be euthanized or shipped back out of the country after testing positive for glanders during routine USDA equine import quarantine. Glanders is a highly contagious upper respiratory disease that can be passed from horse-to-horse as well as to human handlers. Acute clinical signs include fever; cough; difficulty breathing; nasal discharge; swollen and painful submaxillary lymph nodes (the \"glands\" in \"glanders\"); rapidly spreading ulcers on the nasal mucosa, nodules, and chronic abscesses; and small abscesses in the lung and/or abscesses in the liver or spleen, among others. Clinical signs of chronic glanders include coughing; malaise; weight loss; intermittent fever; possible thick nasal discharge, usually out of one nostril; ulcers and nodules on the nasal mucosa; enlarged submaxillary lymph nodes; chronic enlargement and induration (hardening) of lymphatics and lymph nodes; joint swelling and painful leg edema (fluid swelling); and nodules, particularly on the legs, that rupture, release pus, and ulcerate. Glanders has been eradicated from North American and was last reported in the United States in the 1940s. It's recently been reported in several areas around the world, however, including South America, Eastern Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and a rare case in Germany in 2014. Earlier this month August 2017, the 18-year-old Dutch Warmblood gelding Sagacious HF was shipped from Amsterdam to the Miami International Airport after participating in competitions in Sweden and England with Chase Hickok. Under USDA rules, all horses entering the United States, except those coming from Canada, must be quarantined and tested for 4 diseases  dourine, glanders, equine piroplasmosis, and equine infectious anemia  upon arrival. Jeanine Neskey, interim public affairs specialist for the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), said an animal that produces a positive test result is denied entry to the United States. \"Denied entry means that it must be either removed from the U.S. or be euthanized,\" she said. \"If the horse is denied entry into the U.S. (and not euthanized), the owner is free to take the horse to any other country that will accept it.\" Scott Leibsle, DVM, Idaho's deputy state veterinarian, said Sagacious could have contracted the disease through contaminated feed or through water buckets also used by other horses participating in competitions. The gelding might also have been an asymptomatic carrier of the disease, possibly developing signs after experiencing stress \"Transport is the most stressful thing you can do to a horse,\" he said. \"At the same time, you're putting it with new animals in a new area, and putting it under the stress of competition.\" Currently APHIS uses a complement fixation test (CFT) to detect glanders. However, the agency is evaluating other testing methods, including the Western Blot procedure. \"Advancing research and improved technology continue to develop new or improved testing methods for animal diseases,\" Neskey said. \"USDA routinely evaluates all testing methods available and incorporates the methods most appropriate to the needs of import quarantine testing.\" After Sagacious produced a 2nd positive CFT glanders test, he produced a negative Western Blot glanders test. Arrangements were made to place him on extended quarantine pending the results of additional testing with both tests, slated for Wed 23 Aug 2017. Byline: Pat Raia  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail Glanders, also known as farcy, is a contagious infectious disease of equines, acute or chronic, usually fatal, caused by the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_, and characterized by the development of ulcerated nodules that are most commonly found in the upper airway, lungs ,and skin. Felines and other animals are susceptible to infection, which is usually fatal. Humans can be infected and the microorganism (_B. mallei_) is considered a potential bioterrorism agent. The disease, one among the oldest known and that used to be prevalent worldwide, is currently eradicated or effectively controlled in many countries. Recently the disease has been reported in some countries, including Iraq, Turkey, Pakistan, India, Mongolia, China, Brazil, United Arab Emirates, and countries in Africa. Glanders is one of the diseases contained in the list of diseases for mandatory reporting to the World Animal Health Organization (OIE). The bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_ a clonal pathogen, can be found in nasal secretions and skin ulcers of infected animals. The transmission of glanders occurs commonly from intake of water or food contaminated with nasal secretions and exudates eliminated from infected animals, contact with contaminated equipment (saddles, harness) and by eating contaminated equine meat. In the nasal form, nodules arise in septum and turbinates. Nodules progress to irregular edged ulcers; star-shaped scars are characteristic after the resolution of the ulcers. In the early stage, submandibular lymph nodes are enlarged and edematous, adhering to the skin and deep tissues in advanced stages of the disease. In the pulmonary form, inflammatory nodules with caseous or calcified centers are found in the lungs. With the progression of the disease areas of consolidation and pneumonia may be present. The nodules may break and eliminate the inflammatory content into the bronchial tree, spreading the infection to the upper respiratory tract. In the cutaneous form, nodules arise along the lymphatic vessels, especially on the extremities. The nodules may degenerate to form ulcers with drainage of highly infectious purulent material. The liver and spleen may have typical nodular lesions. Histologically, vasculitis, thrombosis, inflammatory cell infiltration and degeneration can be seen. A test based on complement fixation can also be used for screening, but the ELISA test, although more sensitive, is not being routinely used. PCR can be used for specific identification ( ). There are no vaccines. Prevention and control depend on early detection and eliminating infected animals in addition to quarantine and complete disinfection. Treatment, administered only in endemic areas, which does not lead to microbiological cure, is the use of doxycycline, ceftazidime, gentamycin, or streptomycin. Sulfa drugs (including in combination with trimethoprim) seem to be effective in prevention and glanders treatment ( ). For glanders-free countries, there are OIE recommendations on importing equines. An international veterinary certificate is required attesting that the animals showed no clinical signs of glanders and were kept in an exporting country free of the disease for at least 6 months prior to shipment ( ). It appears foreign horse owners will not be able to comply, therefore will be unable to repatriate their show horses? Further information would be welcome. As a horse owner, this would be devastating. We certainly hope Sagacious test later this month August 2017 clears him of this disease. - Mod.TG   .

The person may also have nausea, vomiting, a sore throat and mood swings. Byline: Nomhle Kangootui  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever transmitted by ticks. It can be responsible for severe outbreaks in humans, but it is not pathogenic for ruminants, their amplifying hosts. Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) spreads to humans either by tick-bites or through contact with viraemic animal tissues during and immediately post-slaughter. CCHF outbreaks constitute a threat for public health services because of epidemic potential, high case fatality ratios (10-40 percent), potential for nosocomial outbreaks, and difficulties in treatment and prevention. CCHF is endemic in all of Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and in Asia south of the 50th parallel north, the geographic limit of the genus _Hyalomma_, the principal tick vector  . It is difficult to prevent or control CCHF infection in animals and ticks as the tick-animal-tick cycle usually goes unnoticed and the infection in domestic animals is usually not apparent. Furthermore, the tick vectors are numerous and widespread, so tick control with acaricides (chemicals intended to kill ticks) is only a realistic option for well-managed livestock production facilities. There are no vaccines available for use in animals. Although an inactivated, mouse brain-derived vaccine against CCHF has been developed and used on a small scale in eastern Europe, there is currently no safe and effective vaccine widely available for human use. In the absence of a vaccine, the only way to reduce infection in people is by raising awareness of the risk factors and educating people about the measures they can take to reduce exposure to the virus. Health-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed CCHF, or handling specimens from them, should implement standard infection control precautions. These include basic hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment, safe injection practices and safe burial practices. As a precautionary measure, health-care workers caring for patients immediately outside the CCHF outbreak area should also implement standard infection control precautions.

The steep increase, the highest number of cases in one week since 2015, has taken the total number of confirmed cases since January 2017 to 14 455. Mr Dick said Queenslanders could still take steps to prevent themselves from getting the flu, including getting the vaccination and staying home from work if they are sick. Health Minister Cameron Dick said it was not too late for people to get the flu vaccination. \"You don't have to go to work if you're sick; you can stay at home and recover from the flu,\" he said. Queensland Health public health executive director Sonya Bennett, from the communicable diseases unit, said the increase in confirmed flu cases showed that there is a \"fair bit\" of influenza circulating in the community. \"It may still rise again the next week or so, as the minister said it's not too late to vaccinate.\" Mr Dick said people with flu symptoms should think about visiting their GP instead of the emergency department. \"If you have a lower level condition, you may have to wait for treatment, because we must give priority to people who require assistance,\" he said. Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital emergency specialist David Rosengren said emergency services were \"well equipped\" to deal with the surge in demand; staff members have also been affected by the winter illness. \"It is certainly very challenging at the moment, when we have a record demand for services,\" Dr Rosengren said. \"Reserve a visit to the emergency department for occasions when it's truly needed.\" The vast majority of this year's 2017 flu cases were influenza A, which Dr Rosengren said was likely behind the heightened demand on emergency services. \"75 per cent of our cases this year 2017 happen to be influenza A, which tends to cause a more significant symptom complex for patients than influenza B,\" he said. Dr Rosengren said it was important for people to minimise their contact with other people if they believed they had the flu. \"If you are unwell ... with symptoms typical of the flu, please be very conscious of the impact of spreading that around the community, and if you're unwell, stay at home,\" he said. Dr Bennett said most people would be able to tell whether they had influenza instead of an ordinary winter cold. \"I think we've all been unwell from time to time and understand when rest ... is the best method,\" she said. \"Or if you're feeling particularly unwell, can't get out of bed, not able to eat and drink effectively, those sorts of signs are the indication that you should go and see your doctor.\" With hundreds of thousands of people expected to attend the Ekka show from Friday 11 Aug 2017, Dr Bennett said the best way to avoid picking up the flu along with a show bag was to be vaccinated. \"Like any mass gathering when it is influenza season and gastro season, the best way to protect yourself is to practice good hygiene, so regular handwashing and vaccination are the best protections against the flu,\" she said. \"I would ask people that are attending any mass gathering to consider those things.\" Byline: Rachel Clun  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\.

In Heidelberg a Western Cape town, 3 ostrich farms have tested positive for avian flu. No birds have died on the farms but they remain under quarantine. The 2 farms each have about 1000 ostriches. Van Rhyn said no decision to cull ostriches has been taken yet. She also said chicken in stores was safe for consumption. Bronwynne Jooste, spokesperson for Tourism, Economic Development and Agriculture MEC Alan Winde, said culling of the rest of the chickens and composting of mortalities had already been started. Last week, the department's Veterinary Services programme confirmed the disease had spread to the farm. \"The cause is most likely through contact with wild birds. Since then, meetings with poultry veterinarians and stakeholders such as the National Institute for Communicable Diseases have taken place,\" Jooste said. The farm has been placed under quarantine. She said farms within a 3 km approx 1.8 mi zone of an infected farm would be monitored closely and subjected to the control measures as laid out by the national Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (Daff) \"It is strongly recommended that any movement of pet birds, racing pigeons, breeding birds and show birds be limited as far as possible and covered by a movement permit if coming from within 30 km approx 18 mi of an infected farm,\" said Jooste. Sick or dead birds - both wild birds and poultry - must be reported to local state vets, and exports of poultry and poultry products have been suspended except from poultry compartments registered with Daff, or where a country's import permit contains clauses that are able to be signed by a certifying veterinarian. Winde said the virus presented a challenge to control, but the vets were working hard to contain the spread. \"This is a priority for the poultry industry, and the entire agriculture sector. The outbreak and the current drought have made agriculture a tough space to be in. \"This is a particularly difficult time for those affected farms, which are important employers. This is why we ask all stakeholders to continue working with us to mitigate the impact of this outbreak on our economy,\" Winde said. Avian flu is a viral respiratory disease among birds, believed to be transmitted by wild migratory birds.

Epidemiologically, usually spread by contaminated food or water, typhoid is not a zoonosis like the commoner types of salmonellosis. Clinically, vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent; indeed, constipation is frequently reported. As it is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive. The symptoms of classical typhoid fever typically include fever, anorexia, lethargy, malaise, dull continuous headache, non-productive cough, vague abdominal pain, and constipation. Despite the often high fever, the pulse is often only slightly elevated. During the 2nd week of the illness, there is protracted fever and mental dullness, classically called coma vigil. Diarrhea may develop but usually does not. Many patients develop hepatosplenomegaly both liver and spleen enlarged. After the 1st week or so, many cases develop a maculopapular rash on the upper abdomen. These lesions (\"rose spots\") are about 2 cm 0.78 in in diameter and blanch on pressure. They persist for 2-4 days and may come and go. Mild and atypical infections are common. The word typhoid (as in typhus-like) reflects the similarity of the louseborne rickettsial disease epidemic typhus and that of typhoid fever; in fact, in some areas, typhoid fever is still referred to as abdominal typhus.

In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea: \"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as \"potentially the most important medical advance\" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5). \"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below.

Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world. A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries. Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years. \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\" \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea\". The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years 2 million DALYs since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln 13 million DALYs in the US, and 36-mln 36 million DALYs in Ethiopia. \"Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,\" continues Prof Melegaro \"our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population. Tailoring immunization campaigns to achieve measles eradication goals is essential and currently, for some countries, this means considering also the role of unprotected adolescents and young adults.

The deadly disease is one of the fastest spreading in Somaliland and is claiming the lives of many, from the old to the very young. In some areas, 500 cases are reported each day. And quarantine tents have been put up to deal with the most severely ill until they can be housed on hospital wards. Cholera is a treatable disease contracted through drinking dirty water. But it is something much of Somaliland's 4.5 million population have had to resort to as they stand on the brink of starvation. With more than half their livestock wiped out and no rain for 3 years, people consume whatever water they can find, even if it is contaminated by human waste or rotting animal carcasses. ITV News also spoke to a father who has lost 3 of his children to cholera, \"a father who had to bury 3 young children, who were only yesterday 6 Aug 2017 calling me dad and playing with me.\" That is what has driven him to educate others about cholera so that they don't have to go through the devastation he has. Authorities have rushed to put together teams of volunteers to go into communities to help people avoid contracting cholera. The disease  which has not been seen in developed countries like the UK for over 100 years  can easily be treated using an oral rehydration sachet. But without treatment, a person can quickly become dehydrated, go into shock and die. For the people of Somaliland, fighting disease is just one of their daily struggles while they wait for the rain to come and aid to arrive.

The 1st 2 cases of cholera were tested positive by National Institute of Health Islamabad on Mon 31 Jul 2017 and another 2 confirmed positive for the infection on Fri 4 Aug 2017. All the 4 patients were undergoing treatment at Benazir Bhutto Hospital BH where as many as 4 more suspects of the infection have been admitted for treatment. Data collected by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017 reveals that the allied hospitals have sent stool samples of over 10 child patients to NIH for confirmation of cholera in last week week of Sun 6 Aug 2017. On Sat 12 Aug 2017, as many as 20 child patients with severe diarrhoea were admitted at the BBH of which 4 were suspected as patients of cholera and their stool samples were sent to NIH for confirmation, said Associate Professor of Paediatrics at Rawalpindi Medical University Dr Tariq Saeed when contacted by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017. He added the hospital has not received confirmation reports from the NIH because of holidays there from Saturday to Monday. However, we have been keeping the suspects in isolation under strict monitoring, he said. He added that repeated rainfalls in the region and water inundation inside and outside homes in a number of localities particularly in thickly populated areas of the city are causing contamination of water and foodstuff that increases chances of spread of a number of infections among population while children are at greater risk of contracting life-threatening infections including cholera. It is important that the transmission of cholera occurs primarily by drinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the feces (waste product) of an infected person, including one with no apparent symptoms. It is observed that heavy rainfall causes collection of heavily contaminated water in streets and houses and the waste water flooding out of various nullahs watercourses including Nullah Leh in town causes infections including cholera, typhoid, dysentery, gastroenteritis, hepatitis A and E, shigellosis and giardiasis. Professor Tariq said the consumption of contaminated water and foodstuff causes cholera, an infection in the small intestine caused by bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. Its main symptoms are watery diarrhea and vomiting that can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, and death in cases which are not treated in time, he said. Health experts say that to avoid cholera and other infections, one must use boiled water for drinking and should use vegetables after washing with clean water and it must be kept in mind that raw vegetables should not be eaten in the existing weather conditions instead these should be used after cooking. To a query, Professor Tariq said the heavy rainfall and water accumulation may contaminate water at sources and there may be chances of contamination of water at tube wells so individuals must boil water before drinking to avoid cholera and other infections. He added the appearance of cholera is alarming and it is time for people to take extra ordinary preventive measures to safeguard their children and themselves from the disease. In case water is accumulated inside home due to heavy rainfall and flooded out of sewage lines, it must be wiped out immediately and the space should be washed with clean water as soon as possible to avoid infections. Avoiding inundation of contaminated water inside homes is a must to avoid cholera and other infections, said Professor Tariq.

Malaria is a life-threatening mosquitoborne blood disease caused by a plasmodium parasite, which is usually transmitted to humans through the bite of the anopheles mosquito. Once an infected mosquito bites a human, the parasites multiply in the host's liver before infecting and destroying red blood cells. According to the senior health official, the country's Epidemic Task Force, headed by the Ministry of Health in partnership with United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and other partners has also stepped up efforts to fight the disease. The health official, however, decried the lack of funds to fight malaria and appealed for donations to help fight the disease. In July 2017, OCHA said more than 76 per cent of disease-related deaths in South Sudan are from malaria. However, the civil war in the country probably means that malaria control activities and probably drug distribution have been impaired, which could be one explanation for the reported outbreak. - Mod.EP   .

Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.<br><br><strong> \"References </strong><br> 1.

Children like him are already weakened by hunger and illness, but are now facing the threat of contracting cholera. The deadly disease is one of the fastest spreading in Somaliland and is claiming the lives of many, from the old to the very young. In some areas, 500 cases are reported each day. And quarantine tents have been put up to deal with the most severely ill until they can be housed on hospital wards. Cholera is a treatable disease contracted through drinking dirty water. But it is something much of Somaliland's 4.5 million population have had to resort to as they stand on the brink of starvation. With more than half their livestock wiped out and no rain for 3 years, people consume whatever water they can find, even if it is contaminated by human waste or rotting animal carcasses. ITV News also spoke to a father who has lost 3 of his children to cholera, \"a father who had to bury 3 young children, who were only yesterday 6 Aug 2017 calling me dad and playing with me.\" That is what has driven him to educate others about cholera so that they don't have to go through the devastation he has. Authorities have rushed to put together teams of volunteers to go into communities to help people avoid contracting cholera. The disease  which has not been seen in developed countries like the UK for over 100 years  can easily be treated using an oral rehydration sachet. But without treatment, a person can quickly become dehydrated, go into shock and die. For the people of Somaliland, fighting disease is just one of their daily struggles while they wait for the rain to come and aid to arrive.

The 1st 2 cases of cholera were tested positive by National Institute of Health Islamabad on Mon 31 Jul 2017 and another 2 confirmed positive for the infection on Fri 4 Aug 2017. All the 4 patients were undergoing treatment at Benazir Bhutto Hospital BH where as many as 4 more suspects of the infection have been admitted for treatment. Data collected by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017 reveals that the allied hospitals have sent stool samples of over 10 child patients to NIH for confirmation of cholera in last week week of Sun 6 Aug 2017. On Sat 12 Aug 2017, as many as 20 child patients with severe diarrhoea were admitted at the BBH of which 4 were suspected as patients of cholera and their stool samples were sent to NIH for confirmation, said Associate Professor of Paediatrics at Rawalpindi Medical University Dr Tariq Saeed when contacted by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017. He added the hospital has not received confirmation reports from the NIH because of holidays there from Saturday to Monday. However, we have been keeping the suspects in isolation under strict monitoring, he said. He added that repeated rainfalls in the region and water inundation inside and outside homes in a number of localities particularly in thickly populated areas of the city are causing contamination of water and foodstuff that increases chances of spread of a number of infections among population while children are at greater risk of contracting life-threatening infections including cholera. It is important that the transmission of cholera occurs primarily by drinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the feces (waste product) of an infected person, including one with no apparent symptoms. It is observed that heavy rainfall causes collection of heavily contaminated water in streets and houses and the waste water flooding out of various nullahs watercourses including Nullah Leh in town causes infections including cholera, typhoid, dysentery, gastroenteritis, hepatitis A and E, shigellosis and giardiasis. Professor Tariq said the consumption of contaminated water and foodstuff causes cholera, an infection in the small intestine caused by bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. Its main symptoms are watery diarrhea and vomiting that can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, and death in cases which are not treated in time, he said. Health experts say that to avoid cholera and other infections, one must use boiled water for drinking and should use vegetables after washing with clean water and it must be kept in mind that raw vegetables should not be eaten in the existing weather conditions instead these should be used after cooking. To a query, Professor Tariq said the heavy rainfall and water accumulation may contaminate water at sources and there may be chances of contamination of water at tube wells so individuals must boil water before drinking to avoid cholera and other infections. He added the appearance of cholera is alarming and it is time for people to take extra ordinary preventive measures to safeguard their children and themselves from the disease. In case water is accumulated inside home due to heavy rainfall and flooded out of sewage lines, it must be wiped out immediately and the space should be washed with clean water as soon as possible to avoid infections. Avoiding inundation of contaminated water inside homes is a must to avoid cholera and other infections, said Professor Tariq.

Malaria is a life-threatening mosquitoborne blood disease caused by a plasmodium parasite, which is usually transmitted to humans through the bite of the anopheles mosquito. Once an infected mosquito bites a human, the parasites multiply in the host's liver before infecting and destroying red blood cells. According to the senior health official, the country's Epidemic Task Force, headed by the Ministry of Health in partnership with United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and other partners has also stepped up efforts to fight the disease. The health official, however, decried the lack of funds to fight malaria and appealed for donations to help fight the disease. In July 2017, OCHA said more than 76 per cent of disease-related deaths in South Sudan are from malaria. However, the civil war in the country probably means that malaria control activities and probably drug distribution have been impaired, which could be one explanation for the reported outbreak. - Mod.EP   .

Zika virus (or Zika) has been reported in Suriname. Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in Suriname are infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:  Women who are pregnant:  Do not travel to Suriname.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to Suriname or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers considering pregnancy:  Before you or your partner travel, talk to your health care provider about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection.  Wait before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.  If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex &ndash; or do not have sex &ndash; for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex, or do not have sex, for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy  Talk to your health care provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you&rsquo;re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Wait at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  Men are advised to wait longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.gov  Contact CDC  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  1600 Clifton Road  Atlanta ,  GA  30329-4027  USA  800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)  Contact CDC-INFO  TOP","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Swaziland":{},"Sweden":{"53":{"title":"Glanders, equine - USA: (FL) ex Europe sporting events\r\n\t","date":["23","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH/EDR> Glanders, equine - USA: (FL) ex Europe sporting events\r\n\t[EXTERNAL]","summary":"   Thu 17 Aug 2017 Source: The Horse edited An American dressage horse returning to the United States after a competition tour in Europe has tested positive for Glanders. Shipped from Amsterdam to Miami after participating in Sweden and UK An American dressage horse returning to the United States after a competition tour in Europe could be euthanized or shipped back out of the country after testing positive for glanders during routine USDA equine import quarantine. Glanders is a highly contagious upper respiratory disease that can be passed from horse-to-horse as well as to human handlers. Acute clinical signs include fever; cough; difficulty breathing; nasal discharge; swollen and painful submaxillary lymph nodes (the \"glands\" in \"glanders\"); rapidly spreading ulcers on the nasal mucosa, nodules, and chronic abscesses; and small abscesses in the lung and/or abscesses in the liver or spleen, among others. Clinical signs of chronic glanders include coughing; malaise; weight loss; intermittent fever; possible thick nasal discharge, usually out of one nostril; ulcers and nodules on the nasal mucosa; enlarged submaxillary lymph nodes; chronic enlargement and induration (hardening) of lymphatics and lymph nodes; joint swelling and painful leg edema (fluid swelling); and nodules, particularly on the legs, that rupture, release pus, and ulcerate. Glanders has been eradicated from North American and was last reported in the United States in the 1940s. It's recently been reported in several areas around the world, however, including South America, Eastern Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and a rare case in Germany in 2014. Earlier this month August 2017, the 18-year-old Dutch Warmblood gelding Sagacious HF was shipped from Amsterdam to the Miami International Airport after participating in competitions in Sweden and England with Chase Hickok. Under USDA rules, all horses entering the United States, except those coming from Canada, must be quarantined and tested for 4 diseases  dourine, glanders, equine piroplasmosis, and equine infectious anemia  upon arrival. Jeanine Neskey, interim public affairs specialist for the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), said an animal that produces a positive test result is denied entry to the United States. \"Denied entry means that it must be either removed from the U.S. or be euthanized,\" she said. \"If the horse is denied entry into the U.S. (and not euthanized), the owner is free to take the horse to any other country that will accept it.\" Scott Leibsle, DVM, Idaho's deputy state veterinarian, said Sagacious could have contracted the disease through contaminated feed or through water buckets also used by other horses participating in competitions. The gelding might also have been an asymptomatic carrier of the disease, possibly developing signs after experiencing stress \"Transport is the most stressful thing you can do to a horse,\" he said. \"At the same time, you're putting it with new animals in a new area, and putting it under the stress of competition.\" Currently APHIS uses a complement fixation test (CFT) to detect glanders. However, the agency is evaluating other testing methods, including the Western Blot procedure. \"Advancing research and improved technology continue to develop new or improved testing methods for animal diseases,\" Neskey said. \"USDA routinely evaluates all testing methods available and incorporates the methods most appropriate to the needs of import quarantine testing.\" After Sagacious produced a 2nd positive CFT glanders test, he produced a negative Western Blot glanders test. Arrangements were made to place him on extended quarantine pending the results of additional testing with both tests, slated for Wed 23 Aug 2017. Byline: Pat Raia  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail Glanders, also known as farcy, is a contagious infectious disease of equines, acute or chronic, usually fatal, caused by the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_, and characterized by the development of ulcerated nodules that are most commonly found in the upper airway, lungs ,and skin. Felines and other animals are susceptible to infection, which is usually fatal. Humans can be infected and the microorganism (_B. mallei_) is considered a potential bioterrorism agent. The disease, one among the oldest known and that used to be prevalent worldwide, is currently eradicated or effectively controlled in many countries. Recently the disease has been reported in some countries, including Iraq, Turkey, Pakistan, India, Mongolia, China, Brazil, United Arab Emirates, and countries in Africa. Glanders is one of the diseases contained in the list of diseases for mandatory reporting to the World Animal Health Organization (OIE). The bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_ a clonal pathogen, can be found in nasal secretions and skin ulcers of infected animals. The transmission of glanders occurs commonly from intake of water or food contaminated with nasal secretions and exudates eliminated from infected animals, contact with contaminated equipment (saddles, harness) and by eating contaminated equine meat. In the nasal form, nodules arise in septum and turbinates. Nodules progress to irregular edged ulcers; star-shaped scars are characteristic after the resolution of the ulcers. In the early stage, submandibular lymph nodes are enlarged and edematous, adhering to the skin and deep tissues in advanced stages of the disease. In the pulmonary form, inflammatory nodules with caseous or calcified centers are found in the lungs. With the progression of the disease areas of consolidation and pneumonia may be present. The nodules may break and eliminate the inflammatory content into the bronchial tree, spreading the infection to the upper respiratory tract. In the cutaneous form, nodules arise along the lymphatic vessels, especially on the extremities. The nodules may degenerate to form ulcers with drainage of highly infectious purulent material. The liver and spleen may have typical nodular lesions. Histologically, vasculitis, thrombosis, inflammatory cell infiltration and degeneration can be seen. A test based on complement fixation can also be used for screening, but the ELISA test, although more sensitive, is not being routinely used. PCR can be used for specific identification ( ). There are no vaccines. Prevention and control depend on early detection and eliminating infected animals in addition to quarantine and complete disinfection. Treatment, administered only in endemic areas, which does not lead to microbiological cure, is the use of doxycycline, ceftazidime, gentamycin, or streptomycin. Sulfa drugs (including in combination with trimethoprim) seem to be effective in prevention and glanders treatment ( ). For glanders-free countries, there are OIE recommendations on importing equines. An international veterinary certificate is required attesting that the animals showed no clinical signs of glanders and were kept in an exporting country free of the disease for at least 6 months prior to shipment ( ). It appears foreign horse owners will not be able to comply, therefore will be unable to repatriate their show horses? Further information would be welcome. As a horse owner, this would be devastating. We certainly hope Sagacious test later this month August 2017 clears him of this disease. - Mod.TG   .

Ministers and food safety chiefs from around the European Union are set to meet on Tue 6 Sep 2017 in a bid to get countries to stop \"blaming and shaming\" each other over the scare involving the chemical fipronil. Millions of eggs have been pulled from supermarket shelves across Europe and dozens of poultry farms closed since the discovery of fipronil, which can harm human health, was made public on 1 Aug 2017. The issue has sparked a row between Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, the 3 countries at the epicentre of the crisis, about how long they knew about the problem. \"Blaming and shaming will bring us nowhere and I want to stop this,\" Vytenis Andriukaitis, the European Commissioner for health and food safety, told AFP as he announced the meeting. \"We need to work together to draw the necessary lessons and move forward instead.\" European Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said that \"this is not, let's be clear, a crisis meeting\" and it is being held next month September 2017 to get \"distance to the events\". Fipronil is commonly used to get rid of fleas, lice and ticks from animals but is banned by the European Union from use in the food industry. The EU insists there is no threat to human health, but the World Health Organization (WHO) says that when eaten in large quantities it can harm people's kidneys, liver and thyroid glands. Brussels said the 15 affected EU countries were Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Sweden, Britain, Austria, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Denmark, along with non-EU Switzerland. But in a sign the crisis is going global, Brussels also announced that Hong Kong had received some tainted eggs from the Netherlands, with the southern Chinese city becoming the 1st place in Asia known to be affected. As well as dealing with the immediate food safety issue, the EU is also seeking to calm tempers over the egg row after a series of divisive crises in the bloc in recent years, from Brexit to migration. Belgium earlier this week week of Mon 6 Aug 2017 accused the Netherlands of knowing about the fipronil eggs since November 2016 and failing to notify other countries. On Thu 10 Aug 2017 Dutch Health Minister Edith Schippers admitted the government had made \"errors\" but denied a cover-up. \"We were well aware of a report of the presence of fipronil in the pens of egg-laying hens in November 2016, but there was no indication at the time that fipronil itself was found in the eggs,\" said Schippers. A Dutch whistleblower separately said he had told the authorities that Chickfriend, the Dutch company at the centre of the scandal, was illegally using fipronil in the treatment of lice in chicken pens in The Netherlands. \"I am the anonymous whistleblower,\" Nick Hermens told the NPO public broadcaster. A Belgian company, Poultry Vision, has said it provided Chickfriend with the chemical. Dutch and Belgian investigators carried out coordinated raids on several premises on Thu 10 Aug 2017, arresting 2 people at Chickfriend. However, Belgium itself has been forced to admit that it knew about fipronil in eggs back in June 2017 but kept it secret for nearly 2 months because of a criminal investigation. Fresh discoveries of contaminated eggs have continued daily. Denmark said on Fri 11 Aug 2017 it had found 2 tonnes of fipronil-tainted scrambled eggs, bringing the total of contaminated eggs to 22 tonnes, mainly from Belgium. Poland said it had discovered about 40 000 eggs imported from Germany. French Agriculture Minister Stephane Travert said that since April 2017 the country had sold nearly 250 000 contaminated eggs, imported from Belgium and the Netherlands, but the risk for consumers was \"very low\" given French eating habits. The food scare is one of the biggest to hit Europe since the 2013 horsemeat scandal when equine meat was falsely labelled and mis-sold. Previous food scandals include contamination of chickens and eggs by dioxin in 1999, which began in Belgium, and mad-cow disease via cattle feed contaminated by the ground-up carcasses of animals infected with a deadly brain disorder - which ran from roughly 1986 to 1998 and started in Britain.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\.

That being said, there have only been 9 confirmed cases of WPV1 associated paralytic disease worldwide this year (2017), compared with 37 cases reported last year (2016). In contrast there have been 40 confirmed cases of cVDPV2 confirmed this year (2017) compared with 5 last year (2016). As a reminder, outbreaks due to cVDPV's are considered as significant in the big picture of polio eradication, as they are due to vaccine polioviruses that have reverted in neurovirulence following passage through multiple individuals while circulating in the susceptible population. The goal of the polio eradication initiative is to interrupt transmission of both the WPV's and the cVDPVs. The presence of cVDPVs occurs when there are areas with low vaccination coverage where the vaccine virus (from the OPV) can continue circulating through the susceptible population. - Mod.MPP ","keywordsMatched":[]},"452":{"title":"Poliomyelitis update (21): Syria (DY), Congo DR, cVDPV,\r\n\tglobal ","date":["10","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Poliomyelitis update (21): Syria (DY), Congo DR, cVDPV,\r\n\tglobal [EXTERNAL]","summary":"<br><br><strong>   Thu 10 Aug 2017 Source: Polio Eradication Initiative edited Poliovirus Weekly Update as of: 9 Aug 2017, World Health Organization -</strong><br> New wild poliovirus cases reported this week: 0 Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2017: 8 Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2016: 37 New cVDPV cases reported this week: 0 Total number of cVDPV cases in 2017: 37 Total number of cVDPV cases in 2016: 5 Headlines - The United Kingdom has announced 100 million in new funding to polio eradication to meet the final challenges. - Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: 2 positive environmental samples of wild poliovirus type 1 in Pakistan and 1 in Afghanistan; 3 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus in Syria and 3 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

According to this weekly update from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), there are 2 active transmission sites related to cVDPVs - one in Syria and the 2nd in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). Both are areas that have had transmission identified from earlier this year (2017). In the case of Syria, it appears that the transmission of the cVDPV has been localized to the Deir al Zour governorate with a single case having been reported from the neighboring Raqqah governorate (suggesting this may have been an isolated importation). To date there have been 30 cases of polio attributable to the cVDPV in Syria. In the case of the DR Congo, while cases had been identified in 2 provinces, it appears that circulation has continued in only one of the 2 provinces - Haut Lomami province. As the dates of onset of most recent confirmed cases in both Syria and the DR Congo are in mid-June, and control vaccination campaigns were begun in mid-July (in Syria) and late June and mid July (in the 2 affected provinces in the DR Congo), and we are now in early August, it would not be surprising to learn of additional cases over the coming weeks that were infected before the immunization campaigns were completed.. Also noteworthy in the above update is the identification of 2 WPV1 positive environmental samples in Karachi, Sindh Pakistan. The most recent reported (and confirmed) case of polio due to WPV1 in Sindh was in 2016. ( ).  So the identification of the WPV1 in environmental samples is of concern as it indicates an infected individual(s) has been in the area and might be a source for continued tranmission of the WPV1.. - Mod.MPP ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Taiwan":{"62":{"title":"Zika virus (16): Americas, Asia, research,\r\n\tobservations ","date":["17","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Zika virus (16): Americas, Asia, research,\r\n\tobservations [EXTERNAL]","summary":" 11 _Culex quinquefasciatus_ as vectors  Wed 9 Aug 2017 Source: Emerging Microbes & Infections edited ref: Guedes DR, Paiva MH, Donato MM, et al.

Emerg Microbes Infect. 2017; 6(8): e69. doi: 10.1038/emi.2017.<br><br><strong>59  Abstract </strong><br> Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has recently been associated with an increased incidence of neonatal microcephaly and other neurological disorders. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito bite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some cases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main vector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other mosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the virus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit ZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of laboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. Interestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the midgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in Recife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially fed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx. quinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced. Collectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range of ZIKV vectors than anticipated.  <br><br>Communicated by: Roland Hübner Superior Health Council Brussels Belgium Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active virus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their ability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step toward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_ fed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in saliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing. The study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a competent vector. Several other studies have shown this species to be inefficient vectors or refractory to Zika virus infection. One wonders if the specific _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ used or the Zika virus isolates with which they were tested could account for these very different results. Resolving these discrepancies is important because this mosquito species is very widely distributed around the world and bears directly on risk of outbreaks in geographic areas where _Aedes aegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_ , Zika virus vectors, do not occur. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"91":{"title":"Chikungunya (27) - Americas, Europe, Asia ","date":["18","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Chikungunya (27) - Americas, Europe, Asia [EXTERNAL]","summary":"<br><br><strong> Cases in various countries: Regional summaries - Americas -</strong><br> WHO/PAHO report 18 Aug 2017 Reported cases of chikungunya fever in the Americas, by country or territory - 2017 to EW 33 week ending 18 Aug 2017.

Given the outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections in the region, and the clinical similarity of cases of that virus infection and CHIKV infection, one wonders how many cases that were not laboratory confirmed but clinically diagnosed as ZIKV infections were, in reality, CHIKV infections. It is also possible that a significant proportion of the population have been infected by CHIKV in the previous 3 years and are now immune. It seems likely, however, that CHIKV is now endemic in the Americas, and sporadic, small outbreaks may continue to occur as they do in Asia and Africa. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"354":{"title":"Meningitis, meningococcal - Taiwan: fatal, military base\r\n\t","date":["12","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Meningitis, meningococcal - Taiwan: fatal, military base\r\n\t[EXTERNAL]","summary":"   Thu 26 Jul 2017 Source: Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) edited, translated by rapporteur AH Meningococcal meningitis cluster occurred at military base brought under control. On 26 Jul 2017, the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (Taiwan CDC) announced one cluster of 3 reported meningococcal meningitis cases at a military base. 2 cases tested positive for _Neisseria meningitidis_ and one died. The test result of the other case is pending. All contacts have been evaluated by a physician and given prophylaxis. All of them have been asked to monitor their own health. As of now, no new suspected cases have been reported and the outbreak has been brought under control. On 23 Jul 2017, Taiwan CDC was notified of a suspected meningococcal meningitis case. The case was an active duty soldier at a military base in northern Taiwan. On 22 Jul 2017, when he developed symptoms, he sought immediate medical attention; the following morning, he died. On 23 Jul 2017, another hospital diagnosed the 2nd suspected case of meningococcal meningitis at the same military base. To prevent further transmission, the local health authority conducted an expanded epidemiological investigation and implemented a number of prevention measures, which identified the third suspected case, which was reported to the health authority on 24 Jul 2017. Currently, the 2 cases are stable and being treated. A total of 191 contacts, including military servicemen, family members residing in the same households, and healthcare workers, have been identified. After the physician evaluation, 118 contacts were given prophylaxis. The local health authority provided the contacts with relevant health education and asked them to monitor their own health till 12 Aug 2017. According to the surveillance data compiled by Taiwan CDC, thus far this year 2017, a total of 8 meningococcal meningitis cases, including 1 death, have been confirmed. Meningococcal meningitis is an acute infectious disease caused by meningococcus. The disease is transmitted from person-to-person through droplets of respiratory or throat secretions from carriers. The incubation period ranges from 2 to 10 days. The symptoms include fever, severe headache, nausea, vomiting, neck stiffness, hemorrhagic rash, pink spots, confusion or other mental changes, coma, and seizure. When necessary, antibiotics are prescribed as the treatment. Prompt initiation of antibiotic therapy is always necessary. Before antibiotics were available, the case fatality ratio CFR for invasive meningococcal disease was between 70 and 85 per cent. With use of antibiotics, the CFR now is 10-15 per cent, although meningococcemia is fatal in up to 40 per cent of patients ( ). - Mod.ML To ward off meningococcal meningitis, wash hands with soap and water frequently, maintain good indoor ventilation, avoid staying in poorly ventilated rooms for long hours, and seek prompt medical attention when suspected symptoms developed. Physicians are advised to be vigilant for suspected cases and prescribe antibiotics when appropriate. Travelers planning to visit areas affected by meningococcal meningitis are advised to visit the outpatient travel clinic at contracted hospitals in the nation to evaluate the need of meningococcal meningitis vaccination prior to their trip. The public is urged to seek timely medical assistance when suspected symptoms develop and inform the doctor of any recent travel history to facilitate prompt diagnosis and case reporting. For more information, please visit the Taiwan CDC website at ;  or call the toll-free Communicable Disease Reporting and Consultation Hotline, 1922 (or 0800-001922).  communicated by: ProMED-mail Close and prolonged contact (such as kissing, sneezing, and coughing on someone), living in close quarters or dormitories (military recruits, students), sharing eating or drinking utensils, etc, facilitates the spread of the disease. Close contacts of patients who have meningococcal disease are at great risk for developing meningococcal disease; the risk of secondary disease among close contacts is greatest during the first few days after the onset of disease. Spread of infection to household members and others who were directly exposed to an infected patient's oral secretions (for example, kissing, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation) is prevented by the administration to these close contacts of antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis (rifampin x 2 days, or ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, or azithromycin x a single dose), as soon as possible. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises meningococcal vaccination of the population at risk if the primary attack rate (that is, cases without known close contact with another patient with meningococcal disease) is greater than 10 cases per 100 000 population at risk. The choice of vaccine will depend on knowing the serogroup of the outbreak strain, because the quadrivalent (ACYW) meningococcal vaccine will cover serogroups A, C, Y, and W, and the serogroup B vaccine will cover only serogroup B, without cross-coverage. However, the news report above fails to provide the serogroup of the outbreak strain. - Mod.ML ","keywordsMatched":[]},"503":{"title":"Dengue/DHF update (10): Asia, Pacific, Africa, research, WHO\r\n\t","date":["25","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Dengue/DHF update (10): Asia, Pacific, Africa, research, WHO\r\n\t[EXTERNAL]","summary":" 3 WHO update  The 15 Aug 2017 Source: WHO Western Pacific region edited Dengue situation update no.<br><br><strong> 523 - Northern hemisphere -</strong><br> Cambodia As of 8 Aug 2017, a total of 1604 suspected dengue fever cases were reported in 2017.

The 1st 2 cases of cholera were tested positive by National Institute of Health Islamabad on Mon 31 Jul 2017 and another 2 confirmed positive for the infection on Fri 4 Aug 2017. All the 4 patients were undergoing treatment at Benazir Bhutto Hospital BH where as many as 4 more suspects of the infection have been admitted for treatment. Data collected by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017 reveals that the allied hospitals have sent stool samples of over 10 child patients to NIH for confirmation of cholera in last week week of Sun 6 Aug 2017. On Sat 12 Aug 2017, as many as 20 child patients with severe diarrhoea were admitted at the BBH of which 4 were suspected as patients of cholera and their stool samples were sent to NIH for confirmation, said Associate Professor of Paediatrics at Rawalpindi Medical University Dr Tariq Saeed when contacted by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017. He added the hospital has not received confirmation reports from the NIH because of holidays there from Saturday to Monday. However, we have been keeping the suspects in isolation under strict monitoring, he said. He added that repeated rainfalls in the region and water inundation inside and outside homes in a number of localities particularly in thickly populated areas of the city are causing contamination of water and foodstuff that increases chances of spread of a number of infections among population while children are at greater risk of contracting life-threatening infections including cholera. It is important that the transmission of cholera occurs primarily by drinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the feces (waste product) of an infected person, including one with no apparent symptoms. It is observed that heavy rainfall causes collection of heavily contaminated water in streets and houses and the waste water flooding out of various nullahs watercourses including Nullah Leh in town causes infections including cholera, typhoid, dysentery, gastroenteritis, hepatitis A and E, shigellosis and giardiasis. Professor Tariq said the consumption of contaminated water and foodstuff causes cholera, an infection in the small intestine caused by bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. Its main symptoms are watery diarrhea and vomiting that can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, and death in cases which are not treated in time, he said. Health experts say that to avoid cholera and other infections, one must use boiled water for drinking and should use vegetables after washing with clean water and it must be kept in mind that raw vegetables should not be eaten in the existing weather conditions instead these should be used after cooking. To a query, Professor Tariq said the heavy rainfall and water accumulation may contaminate water at sources and there may be chances of contamination of water at tube wells so individuals must boil water before drinking to avoid cholera and other infections. He added the appearance of cholera is alarming and it is time for people to take extra ordinary preventive measures to safeguard their children and themselves from the disease. In case water is accumulated inside home due to heavy rainfall and flooded out of sewage lines, it must be wiped out immediately and the space should be washed with clean water as soon as possible to avoid infections. Avoiding inundation of contaminated water inside homes is a must to avoid cholera and other infections, said Professor Tariq.

The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80 percent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:  - Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_; - Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65 percent (95 percent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam;  - Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however, have suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be effective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and outbreak situations (63, 64).<br><br><strong> \"References </strong><br> 57.

Emerg Microbes Infect. 2017; 6(8): e69. doi: 10.1038/emi.2017.<br><br><strong>59  Abstract </strong><br> Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has recently been associated with an increased incidence of neonatal microcephaly and other neurological disorders. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito bite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some cases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main vector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other mosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the virus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit ZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of laboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. Interestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the midgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in Recife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially fed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx. quinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced. Collectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range of ZIKV vectors than anticipated.  <br><br>Communicated by: Roland Hübner Superior Health Council Brussels Belgium Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active virus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their ability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step toward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_ fed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in saliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing. The study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a competent vector. Several other studies have shown this species to be inefficient vectors or refractory to Zika virus infection. One wonders if the specific _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ used or the Zika virus isolates with which they were tested could account for these very different results. Resolving these discrepancies is important because this mosquito species is very widely distributed around the world and bears directly on risk of outbreaks in geographic areas where _Aedes aegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_ , Zika virus vectors, do not occur. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"503":{"title":"Dengue/DHF update (10): Asia, Pacific, Africa, research, WHO\r\n\t","date":["25","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Dengue/DHF update (10): Asia, Pacific, Africa, research, WHO\r\n\t[EXTERNAL]","summary":" 3 WHO update  The 15 Aug 2017 Source: WHO Western Pacific region edited Dengue situation update no.<br><br><strong> 523 - Northern hemisphere -</strong><br> Cambodia As of 8 Aug 2017, a total of 1604 suspected dengue fever cases were reported in 2017.

Department of Disease Control (DDC) chief Dr Jessada Chokdamrongsuk reported on Mon 28 Aug 2017, that 1978 cases of melioidosis had been reported from 1 Jan 2017 to 22 Aug 2017. The disease, caused by the bacterium _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ and prevalent during the rainy season in the subtropics, peaks every August in Thailand and has been wider spread this year 2017, he said. \"The bacterium thrives in contaminated water and soil and infects humans and animals through direct contact. People could get infected from prolonged exposure to contaminated water or soil, especially if they have any open sores or lesions in the skin,\" Jessada said. \"Infection can also come from consuming contaminated water or food.\" Melioidosis produces a variety of acute and severe symptoms, he said, including long-lasting fever with no other apparent cause, ulcers or abscesses in the lungs, liver or spleen, and blood infections. The disease, which mainly affects adults, can be fatal, he said. Death has been known to result within 2-3 days of admission to hospital. Risk factors for infection include chronic respiratory and lung disease, tuberculosis, diabetes, chronic renal disease, thalassemia, cancer, and immune-suppressing conditions unrelated to HIV. Jessada advised people coming into regular contact with floodwater to wear boots, drink only water that has been boiled, avoid raw and partially cooked food, wash immediately after exposure and seek medical attention if a fever persists for more than 5 days or abscesses become chronic.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Melioidosis is a disease of the rainy season in its endemic areas. It mainly affects people who have direct contact with soil and water. Many have an underlying predisposing condition such as diabetes (commonest risk factor), renal disease, cirrhosis, thalassemia, alcohol dependence, immunosuppressive therapy, chronic obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and excess kava consumption. Kava is an herbal member of the pepper family that can be associated with chronic liver disease. Melioidosis may present at any age, but peaks in the 4th and 5th decades of life, affecting men more than women. In addition, although severe fulminating infection can and does occur in healthy individuals, severe disease and fatalities are much less common in those without risk factors. The most commonly recognized presentation of melioidosis is pneumonia, associated with high fever, significant muscle aches, chest pain, and  although the cough can be nonproductive  respiratory secretions can be purulent, significant in quantity, and associated with on-and-off bright, red blood. The lung infection can be rapidly fatal  with bacteremia and shock  or somewhat more indolent. Acute melioidosis septicemia is the most severe complication of the infection. It presents as a typical sepsis syndrome with hypotension, high cardiac output, and low systemic vascular resistance. In many cases, a primary focus in the soft tissues or lung can be found. The syndrome, usually in patients with risk factor comorbidities, is characteristically associated with multiple abscesses involving the cutaneous tissues, the lung, the liver, and spleen, and a very high mortality rate of 80 to 95 percent. With prompt optimal therapy, the case fatality rate can be decreased to 40 to 50 percent. The melioidosis bacillus is intrinsically insensitive to many antimicrobials. It should be noted that bioterrorism strains may be engineered to be even more resistant. _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ is usually inhibited by tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT), antipseudomonal penicillins, carbapenems, ceftazidime, and amoxicillin/clavulanate or ampicillin/sulbactam. Ceftriaxone and cefotaxime have good in vitro activity but poor efficacy; and cefepime did not appear, as well, to be equivalent to ceftazidime in a mouse model. The unusual antimicrobial profile of resistance to colistin and polymyxin B and the aminoglycosides but sensitivity to amoxicillin/clavulanate is a useful tool to consider in treatment of infection with the organism. The randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing melioidosis treatment have been reviewed, and it was found that the formerly standard therapy of chloramphenicol, doxycycline, and SXT combination had a higher mortality rate than therapy with ceftazidime, imipenem/cilastatin, or amoxicillin/clavulanate (or ampicillin/sulbactam). The betalactam-betalactamase inhibitor therapy, however, seemed to have a higher failure rate. Source: Tolaney P, Lutwick LI: Melioidosis. In: Lutwick LI, Lutwick SM (eds).

Zika virus (or Zika) has been reported in Tonga. Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in Tonga are infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:  Women who are pregnant:  Do not travel to Tonga.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to Tonga or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers considering pregnancy:  Before you or your partner travel, talk to your health care provider about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection.

The Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and recommended the extension of revised Temporary Recommendations for a further 3 months. The key change is the inclusion of DR Congo and Syria in the category 'States infected with cVDPV2s, with potential risk of international spread'. - Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: Afghanistan: 1 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case; Pakistan: 1 new WPV1-positive environmental sample; Syrian Arab Republic: 3 new circulating vaccine-derived polio type 2 (cVDPV2) from Syria, 2 from Deir ez-Zor and 1 from Homs governorates.

It is the most recent case in the country, and had onset of paralysis on 10 Jul 2017, from Zabul province, neighbouring Kandahar province and Pakistan. - Afghanistan continues to coordinate activities with neighbouring Pakistan, to address both cross-border transmission and focus on reaching mobile populations with oral polio vaccine (OPV). Transmission linking both countries runs primarily across 3 corridors, namely: eastern Afghanistan and Khyber-Peshawar, Pakistan; greater Kandahar/Helmand and Quetta, Pakistan; and, Paktika/Patkya/Khost and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa/Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Pakistan.<br><br><strong> Pakistan </strong><br> - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week; the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 3.

The total number of cVDPV2 cases this year 2017 remains 7, in 2 separate outbreaks: in Haut Lomami province (5 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on 13 Jun 2017); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on 26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017, with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May 2017). - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time. Outbreak response is taking place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols, targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 across the 2 provinces. - The 1st mOPV2 round was implemented on 27-29 Jun 2017 in the 2 affected provinces; and the 2nd mOPV2 round ran from 13-15 Jul 2017 in Haut Lomami and 20-22 Jul 2017 in Maniema. - Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.<br><br><strong> Middle East -</strong><br> - In Syria, 3 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were officially reported in the past week.

Two vaccination campaigns are planned for both Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa governorates. If there is geographic spread, the extent of these campaigns will have to be adjusted. - The 1st mOPV2 round in Deir ez-Zor was successfully carried out between 22-26 Jul 2017. Independent post-campaign monitoring reflected coverage of 88.4 percent (based on caregiver recall). The 2nd round is planned for 19-23 Aug 2017, and will include mOPV2 and IPV. - Raqqa Governorate started mOPV2 campaigns on 12 Aug 2017. - Plans are being finalized to mitigate the risks of further spread from the outbreak zone to neighbouring areas and countries, including immunization of at-risk populations in northwest Syria, Turkey and Lebanon.

That being said, there have only been 9 confirmed cases of WPV1 associated paralytic disease worldwide this year (2017), compared with 37 cases reported last year (2016). In contrast there have been 40 confirmed cases of cVDPV2 confirmed this year (2017) compared with 5 last year (2016). As a reminder, outbreaks due to cVDPV's are considered as significant in the big picture of polio eradication, as they are due to vaccine polioviruses that have reverted in neurovirulence following passage through multiple individuals while circulating in the susceptible population. The goal of the polio eradication initiative is to interrupt transmission of both the WPV's and the cVDPVs. The presence of cVDPVs occurs when there are areas with low vaccination coverage where the vaccine virus (from the OPV) can continue circulating through the susceptible population. - Mod.MPP ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Turkmenistan":{},"Tuvalu":{},"Uganda":{"73":{"title":"Measles update (42): Europe, Middle East, Africa, Pacific\r\n\t","date":["18","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Measles update (42): Europe, Middle East, Africa, Pacific\r\n\t[EXTERNAL]","summary":"<br><br><strong> Pacific -</strong><br> 5 Australia (Perth, Western Australia)  Fri 18 Aug 2017 9:58 AM AWST Source: The West Australian edited Health authorities have confirmed a 3rd case of measles in a student from the Perth Waldorf School Western Australia, WA and warned there could be more.

Consultant in communicable disease control for Public Health Wales Dr Rhianwen Stiff said: \"In our current outbreak, we have seen measles pass between pupils at the same school. With children returning from holidays in Europe, and with our ongoing outbreak in Newport and Torfaen, we are concerned that the start of the new term could lead to further cases of measles in Wales. Measles is highly contagious and passes very easily between people who are unvaccinated. The message is simple, MMR offers the best and only protection against measles. If you, or your child, are not up to date with 2 doses of the MMR vaccine, speak to your GP surgery immediately.\" Parents are also being urged not to take children who appear to have measles to hospital or a GP surgery without calling ahead 1st. A vaccination programme in schools across Newport was launched following the 1st outbreak, with 1089 children receiving immunisation. Adults born after 1970 who have never had measles or the MMR vaccine are also being urged to contact their GP to arrange immunisation, especially if they work with children. The 1st dose of the vaccine is usually given to babies between 12 and 13 months, and the 2nd at around 3 years, 4 months. But it can be given at any time.

While it is good news this victim does not seem to have any of the hemorrhagic diseases mentioned, the reported clinical signs do not completely fit with carbon monoxide poisoning either. Signs and symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning may include any or all of the following: - a dull persistent headache - confusion - dizziness - weakness - blurred vision - shortness of breath - loss of consciousness. I have never known carbon monoxide to cause bleeding from the ears. Other than hemorrhagic diseases, bleeding from the ears may be associated trauma to the ear drum, pressure changes (such as with diving) causing rupture of the ear drum, an infection in the middle ear, or a foreign body in the ear. Trauma to the eardrum may result in from a tear or puncture and present as: - acute hearing loss - persistent ringing in the ear or ears - vertigo (a feeling or sensation of spinning) - vertigo induced nausea and/or vomiting - rare occasions may include a small amount of fluid, but seldom blood. An infection, especially of the middle ear may present as: - fever associated with pain in the ear or pressure in the ear - unsteady balance - inability or difficulty sleeping. Abrupt changes in pressure to the ear or within the ear may present as: - acute pain in the ear or intense pressure feeling in the ear - a ringing sensation in the ears - dizziness - in rare cases blood or fluid from one or both ears. Foreign bodies in the ear are most apt to cause bleeding from the ears. Other clinical signs and symptoms associated with this may include: - fluid or blood discharge from the affected ear, or if both ears if they are both damaged - pressure in the ear(s) - pain - hearing loss - dizziness - nausea and/or vomiting. None of these ear conditions would be associated with blood from the mouth. So while the individual may have had carbon monoxide poisoning, it seems there is still more to the story.

On 20 Aug 2017, the ministry received blood samples of 2 patients from Kiboga and Nakaseke hospital suspected Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF). According to a 21 Aug 2017 statement signed by the acting Director General, health services Dr Anthony Mbonye, the 2 victims tested positive to Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever CCFH. CCHF is a common disease among humans and animals caused by caused by a tick-borne virus (_Nairovirus_); the virus causes severe viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 percent. Dr Mbonye says that the general supportive care with treatment of symptoms is the main approach to managing CCFH among humans. The statement warns that while its symptoms do not appear in the infected animal, it appears in a very dangerous way in human beings. \"You are required to work with the office of the District Veterinary Officer to strengthen measures against CCHF control in animals, implement interventions to reduce the risk of CCHF infections among humans, and interventions to control CCFH in health care settings. You are also reminded to immediately report and investigate any CCFH suspected cases in your district,\" reads the statement in part signed by Dr Mbonye. CCHF virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. According to Ministry of health, the majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians and that human-to-human transmission occurs from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of infected persons. Hospital-acquired infections can also occur due to improper sterilization of medical equipment, reuse of needles, and contamination of medical supplies. Records indicate that since 2000, Uganda has experienced repeated outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF). Ebola VHF outbreak occurred in the districts of Gulu in 2000, Bundibugyo, 2007, Luwero, 2011, Kibaale in July 2012, Luwero in November 2012. Marburg VHF was earlier reported in Ibanda in 2007.

CCHF is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and Asian countries south of the 50th parallel north  the geographical limit of the principal tick vector. The hosts of the CCHF virus include a wide range of wild and domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats. Animals become infected by the bite of infected ticks and the virus remains in their bloodstream for about one week after infection, allowing the tick-animal-tick cycle to continue when another tick bites. Although a number of tick genera are capable of becoming infected with CCHF virus, ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_ are the principal vector. The CCHF virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Human-to-human transmission is possible.

In the 11 day period since the last update, there have been 7 newly confirmed cases reported of whom 5 were from Dawmat Aljandal (Al Jawf region), the location that had nosocomial transmission identified since the beginning of this past month July 2017. Clearly transmission is continuing in this area, with 3 newly confirmed secondary cases in household contacts - at least 2 of whom were identified through screening of asymptomatic household contacts, and 2 additional cases in which high risk exposures are still under investigation. We do not know if these household contacts are associated with the earlier identified transmission chain in Dawmat Aljandal or if these are newly identified chains of transmission. The other 2 newly confirmed cases involve \"sporadic\" cases - an individual in Hail whose high risk exposure history is still under investigation, and an individual from Alaflaj (Riyadh region) with a history of direct contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. As to be expected, concern is being voiced on the international level with the upcoming Hajj and this recent increase in cases reported both in Saudi Arabia and in the UAE. We now have gone through 5 Hajj periods since the identification of the MERS-CoV and to date there have been no cases of MERS-CoV infection identified in returning Hajjis. The case in the UAE (see section 1 above) actually had onset of illness over 1 month ago with no secondary cases/infections identified among known contacts of this case. As for the cases in Saudi Arabia, and more specifically the Hajj, population movement is very well defined during the Hajj, no camels are permitted in the areas where Hajjis are congregated, and there are Hajj specific health services that are separate from those that are available for the general Saudi population, all factors that are reducing the likelihood of Hajjis having inadvertent (or intentional) high risk exposures. Hopefully my optimism is well placed and we will pass through a 6th Hajj period without impact on international transmission of the MERS-CoV associated with this Hajj. - Mod.MPP ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"United Kingdom":{"188":{"title":"Foot & mouth disease - Nepal: (CH) bovine, new, st A, gt VII,\r\n\tOIE ","date":["23","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH> Foot & mouth disease - Nepal: (CH) bovine, new, st A, gt VII,\r\n\tOIE [EXTERNAL]","summary":"Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter Epidemiology Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive, Illegal movement of animals Epidemiological comments: 15 per cent of young (1-1.5 years old) and 85 per cent of adult (3-5 years old) cross breed cattle and buffaloes of 4 farms were affected with typical signs and symptoms of foot and mouth disease (FMD) such as high fever, drooling of saliva, champing of jaws, lameness, off feed, lesions on tongue.

For the said and additional information on Nepal's FMD past records, including genotyping results (though not yet of the newly introduced A/ASIA/G-VII lineage), see  . The identification of the A/ASIA/G-VII lineage in Nepal represents further spread of this virus, which had been evolving in India many years back (\"A/IND/40/2000\", genotyped A/ASIA/G-VII, was collected in 1999). In 2010, this strain was detected in Myanmar. In 2015, it appeared for the 1st time in the Middle East (\"FMD Pool 3\"), being detected in Saudi Arabia followed, during the same year, by Iran, Turkey and Armenia. Most recently (May 2017), this virus was identified in Northern Israel, on the Lebanese and Syrian borders.

Emerg Microbes Infect. 2017; 6(8): e69. doi: 10.1038/emi.2017.<br><br><strong>59  Abstract </strong><br> Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has recently been associated with an increased incidence of neonatal microcephaly and other neurological disorders. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito bite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some cases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main vector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other mosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the virus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit ZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of laboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. Interestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the midgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in Recife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially fed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx. quinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced. Collectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range of ZIKV vectors than anticipated.  <br><br>Communicated by: Roland Hübner Superior Health Council Brussels Belgium Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active virus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their ability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step toward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_ fed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in saliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing. The study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a competent vector. Several other studies have shown this species to be inefficient vectors or refractory to Zika virus infection. One wonders if the specific _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ used or the Zika virus isolates with which they were tested could account for these very different results. Resolving these discrepancies is important because this mosquito species is very widely distributed around the world and bears directly on risk of outbreaks in geographic areas where _Aedes aegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_ , Zika virus vectors, do not occur. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"749":{"title":"Zika virus (17): Americas, research, observations ","date":["24","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Zika virus (17): Americas, research, observations [EXTERNAL]","summary":" 6 Vaccine update  22/29 Aug 2017 Source: Journal of the American Medical Association, JAMA edited ref: Lyon J.

Multiple candidate Zika vaccines have been shown protective against infection with the virus in animal studies, with several now in human trials, but none were tested in the context of pregnancy, according to the authors of the study published in Cell  . The 2 vaccine candidates investigated in the new study are the 1st to demonstrate efficacy in preventing vertical transmission of the virus and related fetal death in an animal model. Although the vaccines were administered to female mice prior to pregnancy, the result is considered an important step toward developing a vaccine that could be safely given to pregnant women. One of the 2 candidates is a modified messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine encoding Zika genes, developed by the biotechnology company Moderna. It is already in safety trials in women who are not pregnant. The other is a live-attenuated Zika strain developed by researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). The testing was carried out by scientists from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Washington University School of Medicine, and UTMB. The researchers 1st vaccinated the mice with 1 of the vaccines or a placebo. After mating, the animals were challenged with the virus 6 days into pregnancy. A week later, more than 50 percent of placentas and fetuses from mice administered the mRNA vaccine had virtually no Zika RNA. The remainder had \"substantially lower\" levels relative to placebo. The live vaccine provided broader protection: 78 percent of placentas and 83 percent of fetuses had Zika RNA at or below the level of detection, while the placebo group exhibited significantly higher levels of placental and fetal Zika RNA. Mice vaccinated with either vaccine had significantly higher rates of fetal viability; whereas 100 percent of fetuses from mice vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine were born, none survived to term in the placebo group.

The reported numbers affirm a total of 1997 deaths starting from the end of April 2017. As of Saturday evening 19 Aug 2017, the number of cholera cases stands at 527 000. The WHO report also noted that Yemen's Sanaa and Al Hudaydah governorate, located in the west of the country, have the highest rates of cholera spread compared with other governorates. The combined number of infected individuals in the two areas stands at 62 000. The Hajjah governorate has maintained the highest number of cholera related deaths reported at 381. Meanwhile, the United Nations has raised the Humanitarian Response Plan budget to address the Yemeni crisis. The new budget is placed at USD 370 million. Despite the critical situation in Yemen and the spread of cholera, the international organization said that only 33 per cent of the required funds have been provided by donors, most notably Saudi Arabia.  communicated by: ProMED-mail Although a number of sources had reported decreasing numbers of daily cases, the new numbers seem to support the continuing robust number of daily cases.

There is a widespread cholera outbreak in Yemen. Between April and July 2017, more than 400,000 cholera cases and nearly 2,000 deaths have been reported. Twenty-one of the country&rsquo;s 23 governorates have reported suspected cases.  Public health officials are responding by establishing treatment facilities, training healthcare workers, providing medical supplies, purifying water, and deploying staff trained to detect and respond to cases quickly.  What is cholera?  Cholera is a disease spread by drinking water or eating food contaminated with cholera bacteria. Severe cholera is characterized by large amounts of watery diarrhea, often described as &ldquo;rice-water stool&rdquo; because it can have a pale, milky appearance. It can also be accompanied by nausea and vomiting. If untreated, the loss of fluid can be deadly. But simple treatment, including replacing lost body fluids, can lower the risk of death to less than 1%.  What can travelers do to prevent cholera?  Because it is spread through contaminated food and water, cholera is easily prevented by sticking to safe eating and drinking habits and regularly washing hands .  A newly licensed cholera vaccine (Vaxchora, PaxVax Corporation) prevents severe diarrhea caused by the most common type of cholera bacteria. This vaccine is available in the United States and is recommended by CDC for adults traveling to areas with active cholera transmission, such as Yemen. Avoiding unsafe food and water even after cholera vaccination will also help prevent cholera and many other diarrheal infections. Travelers should discuss the following questions with a healthcare provider when considering the vaccine:  How common is cholera where I am going?  How common is cholera in travelers to this area?  What would put me at risk for cholera?  Will I be able to receive rapid treatment (if needed) at my destination?
