Five districts in 3 governorates are now infected.  The total number of cVDPV2 cases is 33 (this includes the previously reported 29 cases from Mayadeen district, Deir ez-Zor governorate, and 1 case from Tell Abyad district, Raqqa governorate). All confirmed cases to date have had onset of paralysis before 11 Jul 2017.  Final lab results for an additional 9 poliovirus type-2 (PV2) isolates from Deir ez-Zor are pending.  Discussions around expanding the scope of the immunization response to include accessible areas of a Tadmour sub-district in Homs, bordering Deir ez-Zor , will be held in light of the confirmation of the cases in this area.  Raqqa governorate commenced its 1st immunization round on 12 Aug 2017 (Raqqa and Thawra districts) and 13 Aug 2017 (Tell Abyad district). The immunization round aims to reach 120 000 children under 5 years of age. Preliminary information suggests the rounds are reaching children in all 3 districts.  Preparations continue for the 2nd round in Deir ez-Zor governorate, scheduled for 19-23 Aug 2017. IPV inactivated polio vaccine for use in the 2nd rounds in Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa governorates has arrived in Damascus.  The total number of AFP acute flaccid paralysis cases detected in Deir ez-Zor governorate since the beginning of 2017 is 113 (83 from Mayadeen, 11 from Deir ez-Zor, and 19 from Boukamal districts). Raqqa governorate has reported 16 AFP cases (5 from Raqqa, 10 from Tell Abyad, and 1 from Thawra districts). Homs governorate has reported 26 AFP cases (11 from Homs city, 12 from Rastan, 1 from Tadmour, and 2 from Talkalakh districts).  The Eradication and Outbreak Management Group (EOMG) has approved the release of additional doses of IPV to cover high risk population groups in northwest Syria, Turkey, and Lebanon. Lebanon requested 144 000 doses and has begun to implement IPV campaigns across the country.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Unfortunately transmission of the cVDPV2 in Syria has continued. With each report, the date of onset of the most recent case shifts to a date approximately one month preceding the report, probably reflecting the time it takes from specimen collection to appropriate reference laboratory. We are fairly sure there will be an additional 9 cases confirmed from Deir ez-Zor, as the report above mentions that there are 9 poliovirus isolates pending typing (WPV vs cVDPV). The report also mentions a significant number of AFP cases identified in the 3 governorates, suggesting there may be more cases in the pipeline for confirmation. The control activities have been implemented during this week and will be implemented in additional areas next week week of 21 Aug 2017, so hopefully there will be interruption of transmission going forward.  The disturbing news in the situation report above, is that there is now involvement of 3 governorates. Deir ez-Zor, Raqqa, and now Homs. On a map of Syria showing provinces/governorates ((http://www.freeworldmaps.net/asia/syria/syria-political-map.jpg)), one can see that Deir ez-Zor, the main governorate involved in this outbreak is located in the northeast of the country sharing it's eastern border with Iraq. It shares a southern border with Homs, and a western border with Raqqa (Ar-Raqqah on this map) governorate. Hopefully the cVDPV2 will not continue to travel in the country outside of the currently 3 affected areas. - Mod.MPP   <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Somalia: declared polio free. Date: Mon 14 Aug 2017. Source: AllAfrica, Shabelle Media Network (Mogadishu) report (edited) (http://allafrica.com/stories/201708150227.html)   The UN World Health Organisation (WHO) said it had not recorded any case of polio disease in Somalia in the last 3 years, declaring the country polio free.  The WHO said the country recorded the last case of polio in 2014 in the central part of the country but has since then remained free of the paralyzing disease.  The UN health agency, however, warned Somalia remained vulnerable, calling for continued vaccination campaign, Xinhua News Agency reported.  The head of the WHO Eastern Mediterranean, which covers Somalia, Mohamed Fiqi said that massive vaccination campaigns and commitment from government and international actors had ensured the polio virus did not recur in the Horn of Africa country.  \"As the world edges closer to eradicating polio, keeping alert in countries that have high risk of polio importation like Somalia is more of priority than ever,\" Fiqi said.  \"As we move forward, the polio programme in Somalia needs to continue to work to maintain and improve the level of population immunity against polio through target vaccination campaign and strengthening of the routine immunisation services and infrastructure,\" Fiqi added.  The declaration by WHO keeps Somalia outside the last group of countries which still record cases of polio in the world.  Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan are the remaining countries where polio is still being recorded. The WHO chief warned Somalia remains at risk of importation of the virus from these countries.  Somalia President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo praised efforts to rid his country of the polio disease which he noted had subjected many children into suffering.  \"No cases were found for the past 3 years and no child was affected by this disease. Many of our children have suffered from polio for many years.  \"To eradicate polio was a big success and it was collective effort and commitment by many young men and women who sacrificed their lives,\" Farmaajo noted.  The 3 year polio-free celebration comes amidst the worst outbreak of measles the country has seen in years.  Somalia is also still responding to an outbreak of acute watery diarrhoea/cholera, which began in January 2017. Polio systems and networks are being used in both interventions.  \"Polio infrastructure has been critical in responding to these other serious outbreaks,\" said Fiqi.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  Achieving 3 years with no new cases of polio reported is a significant achievement for Somalia. That being said, it's important to remember that this too is a country with internal civil strife and warring factions, which may impede the identification of poliovirus associated disease either due to infrastructural challenges in good specimen collection and transport, or access of the population to the healthcare infrastructure. A reminder is the identification of WPV associated cases in Borno, Nigeria last year (2016), involving a virus last seen 5 years before in the same state.

We continue to work together to advance shared priorities, including governance and democracy, regional security, poverty reduction, polio eradication, trade, defense, and the fight against climate change.\"  - The 14th Emergency Committee for polio eradication under the International Health Regulations met on 3 Aug 2017 and has made its recommendations to the WHO Director-General, who has accepted them. The Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and recommended the extension of revised Temporary Recommendations for a further 3 months. The key change is the inclusion of DR Congo and Syria in the category 'States infected with cVDPV2s, with potential risk of international spread'.  - Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: Afghanistan: 1 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case; Pakistan: 1 new WPV1-positive environmental sample; Syrian Arab Republic: 3 new circulating vaccine-derived polio type 2 (cVDPV2) from Syria, 2 from Deir ez-Zor and 1 from Homs governorates. Details in country-specific sections below.  Afghanistan  - One new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week, bringing the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 to 6. It is the most recent case in the country, and had onset of paralysis on 10 Jul 2017, from Zabul province, neighbouring Kandahar province and Pakistan. - Afghanistan continues to coordinate activities with neighbouring Pakistan, to address both cross-border transmission and focus on reaching mobile populations with oral polio vaccine (OPV). Transmission linking both countries runs primarily across 3 corridors, namely: eastern Afghanistan and Khyber-Peshawar, Pakistan; greater Kandahar/Helmand and Quetta, Pakistan; and, Paktika/Patkya/Khost and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa/Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Pakistan.  Pakistan  - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week; the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 3. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 11 Jun 2017, from Killa Abdullah, Balochistan. - 1 new WPV1-positive environmental sample was reported in the past week, collected on 28 Jul 2017, from Quetta, Balochistan. - A special vaccination round is being implemented during August 2017 targeting areas with recent polio cases and positive environmental samples. These include Rawalpindi/Islamabad and demographically connected areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Quetta Block, and parts of Karachi. - Under the National Emergency Action Plan for polio eradication, the country is planning to implement 2 nation-wide and 2 sub-national vaccination rounds from September to December 2017.  Nigeria - - No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 21 Aug 2016 in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno. - Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016). - Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance.  Lake Chad Basin  - The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno, Nigeria in 2016) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) (Borno and Sokoto provinces in Nigeria in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak. - Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.  Central Africa  - No new cases of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). The total number of cVDPV2 cases this year 2017 remains 7, in 2 separate outbreaks: in Haut Lomami province (5 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on 13 Jun 2017); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on 26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017, with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May 2017). - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time. Outbreak response is taking place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols, targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 across the 2 provinces. - The 1st mOPV2 round was implemented on 27-29 Jun 2017 in the 2 affected provinces; and the 2nd mOPV2 round ran from 13-15 Jul 2017 in Haut Lomami and 20-22 Jul 2017 in Maniema. - Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.  Middle East  - In Syria, 3 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were officially reported in the past week. The total number of cases in this outbreak is 33. Onset of paralysis of these cases is between 3 Mar 2017 and 10 Jul 2017. 31 of the cases are from Deir ez-Zor governorate (29 from Mayadeen district, one from Deir ez-Zor district, and one from Boukamal district); 1 case is from Talabyad district, Raqqa governorate; and, 1 is from Tadmour district in Homs governorate. - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized and implemented, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Two vaccination campaigns are planned for both Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa governorates. If there is geographic spread, the extent of these campaigns will have to be adjusted. - The 1st mOPV2 round in Deir ez-Zor was successfully carried out between 22-26 Jul 2017. Independent post-campaign monitoring reflected coverage of 88.4 percent (based on caregiver recall). The 2nd round is planned for 19-23 Aug 2017, and will include mOPV2 and IPV. - Raqqa Governorate started mOPV2 campaigns on 12 Aug 2017. - Plans are being finalized to mitigate the risks of further spread from the outbreak zone to neighbouring areas and countries, including immunization of at-risk populations in northwest Syria, Turkey and Lebanon. Following confirmation of the case in Homs, discussions are ongoing to further extend the geographic reach of the outbreak response.  Officially reported wild poliovirus cases as of 15 Aug 2017  Total global cases in 2017: 9 (compared with 21 for the same period in 2016) Total in endemic countries in 2017: 9 (compared with 21 for the same period in 2016) - Afghanistan: 6 cases in 2017 (compared with 6 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 10 Jul 2017 - Pakistan: 3 cases in 2017 (compared with 13 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 11 Jun 2017 - Nigeria: 0 cases in 2017 (compared with 2 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 21 Aug 2016 Total in non-endemic countries in 2017: 0 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016)  Total global cases in 2016: 37 - Total in endemic countries: 37 - Total in non-endemic countries: 0  Officially reported cVDPV cases as of 15 Aug 2017 - Total global cases in 2017: 40 (compared with 3 for the same period in 2016) - Syrian Arab Republic: 33 cases in 2017 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 10 Jul 2017 - Democratic Republic of the Congo: 7 cases in 2017 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 13 Jun 2017 - Pakistan: 0 cases in 2017 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 17 Dec 2016 - Nigeria: 0 cases in 2017 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 28 Oct 2016 - Lao People's Democratic Republic: 0 case in 2017 (compared with 3 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 11 Jan 2016  Total global cases in 2016: 5 - Total in endemic countries: 2 - Total in non-endemic countries: 3   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  This week's global update is similar to prior weeks in terms of low level identification of WPV1 associated disease (a single case confirmed in Afghanistan this past week), one positive WPV1 isolated from an environmental sample in Pakistan, and 3 newly confirmed cVDPV2 associated cases in Syria.  That being said, there have only been 9 confirmed cases of WPV1 associated paralytic disease worldwide this year (2017), compared with 37 cases reported last year (2016). In contrast there have been 40 confirmed cases of cVDPV2 confirmed this year (2017) compared with 5 last year (2016). As a reminder, outbreaks due to cVDPV's are considered as significant in the big picture of polio eradication, as they are due to vaccine polioviruses that have reverted in neurovirulence following passage through multiple individuals while circulating in the susceptible population. The goal of the polio eradication initiative is to interrupt transmission of both the WPV's and the cVDPVs. The presence of cVDPVs occurs when there are areas with low vaccination coverage where the vaccine virus (from the OPV) can continue circulating through the susceptible population.

All confirmed cases to date have had onset of paralysis before 14 Jul 2017. - Final lab results are pending for an additional 5 poliovirus type-2 (PV2) isolates (3 from Mayadeen and 1 from Boukamal districts, Deir Ez-Zor governorate, and 1 from Thawra district, Raqqa governorate). - The 2nd immunization round for Deir Ez-Zor started on 22 Aug 2017 and is ongoing due to high levels of population movement in and out of the governorate during the round. - WHO has organized the redistribution of vaccines and mapping of population movements to increase reach. An additional 90 000 mOPV2 doses are being transported from Damascus to Deir Ez-Zor, to cater for population influxes from As-Sukhnah, Homs governorate, and Al-Qa'im in Iraq. Corrective measures are expected to extend the round by 2 days. - Preparations for the 2nd immunization round for Raqqa are underway. - The total number of AFP cases detected in Deir Ez-Zor governorate since the beginning of 2017 is 122 (91 from Mayadeen, 10 from Deir Ez-Zor, and 21 from Boukamal districts). Raqqa governorate has reported 16 AFP cases (5 from Raqqa, 10 from Tell Abyad, and 1 from Thawra districts). Homs governorate has reported 28 AFP cases (12 from Homs city, 13 from Rastan, 1 from Tadmour and 2 from Talkalakh districts).  more details on the vaccination activities and future plans are available at the source URL as well as the epidemic curve and graphic representation of the vaccination status of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis cases by governorate and district. - Mod.MPP   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  In the above global summary, there is still identified transmission ongoing in Pakistan as seen by the positive environmental sample in Karachi as well as the early report on a case of WPV1 associated disease in Karachi. It will be interesting to learn of the genetic profile of the environmental isolates in Karachi (from this past week as well as from a few weeks ago) and compare them with the newly identified WPV1 associated case in Karachi to see if they are genetically related.  There has been more activity associated with cVDPV2 in both Syria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), with 6 newly confirmed cases in Syria and 1 newly confirmed case in the DR Congo. According to the Situation Report in section <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> above, there are still 5 additional PV2 (poliovirus type 2) isolates in Syria undergoing final testing  4 from Deir al Zour and 1 from Raqqa. Hence there will probably be more cases confirmed in the coming days or weeks. I have not been able to identify similar report information from the DR Congo outbreak so it is not clear if the transmission has been interrupted leaving a total of 8 cases, or if there are still probable cases pending confirmation.

Source: Pajhwok Afghan News (edited) (https://www.pajhwok.com/en/2017/08/28/congo-virus-kills-13-infects-42-herat)   Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has killed 13 people in western Herat province this year 2017, with another 42 being treated for the deadly virus, according to officials.  CCHF is a viral disease. Symptoms may include fever, muscle pains, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding into the skin. The CCHF virus is typically spread by tick bites or contact with livestock carrying the disease.  Health officials in Herat advised people to be careful these days due to increased interaction with livestock in the wake of Eidul Adha Sacrifice Feast; 31 Aug-4 Sep 2017, when Muslims across the globe slaughter millions of animals.  Public health director in Herat Abdul Hakim Tamana said many people lost their lives to the Congo virus in the province this year 2017. He said 55 Congo cases were registered in the civil hospital since late March and of the patients, 13 had died. The deceased included 7 men and 6 women, he added.  Tamana said the virus spread from animals and people slaughtering animals should wear gloves.  A livestock farmer, who has contracted Congo virus, said: \"When I slaughtered the sheep, its blood covered my hands and later I started falling sick.\"  Ahmad Khalil Waez, animal healthcare director, said citizens should be careful while slaughtering animals to avoid contracting the Congo virus. He said a butcher should used special glasses, coat, gloves, mask, and shoes while slaughtering the animal.  People mainly contract the CCHF virus from infected ticks or contact with infected animal blood and tissue.  There are no vaccines available to immunize animals but precautionary measures include disinfection of livestock pens, submerging livestock in solutions for decontamination, and meat packaging safeguards.  The virus has had a presence in neighbouring Iran where the virus killed 3 people in 2015.  According to the World Health Organization, CCHF's mortality rate is about 30 percent and is endemic to Africa, the Balkans and Ukraine, the Middle East, and Central Asia.  CCHF was first detected in the Crimea in 1944 and then in the Congo in 1969. In 2011, it was detected for the first time in ticks in Spain.  Byline: Storai Karimi   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  In 2008, a major outbreak was reported in Herat City, western Afghanistan, with approximately 60 suspected and 6 confirmed cases. Later, a cross-sectional seroprevalence survey was conducted among livestock-owning households in the same districts of Herat City where the outbreak had occurred, which showed that IgG seroprevalence was 11.2 and 75.0 percent in humans (n = 330) and livestock (n = 132), respectively ((https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3310665/)).  In 2016, 66 cases had been reported by 7 Sep, with 12 deaths ((http://www.emro.who.int/afg/afghanistan-news/cchf-eid.html)). CCHF virus has been observed in over 30 countries, including in Africa (Democratic Republic of Congo, South Africa, Nigeria, Senegal, Uganda, Tanzania, Mauritania, Kenya), Asia (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, China), the Middle East (Iran, Iraq, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman), and southeastern Europe (the Russian Federation, Bulgaria, Albania, Kosovo, Turkey, Greece, and Spain) ((https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23458713)).  People most at risk of contracting CCHF include animal herders, livestock workers, butchers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Healthcare workers are also at risk of infection through unprotected contact with infectious blood and body fluids while caring for patients. There is no vaccine available for either people or animals, which means prevention is crucial. - Mod.UBA  Maps of Afghanistan can be seen at (http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/afghanistan_admin-2009.jpg) and (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1757). - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ  ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Albania":{},"Algeria":{},"American Samoa":{},"Andorra":{},"Angola":{},"Antigua and Barbuda":{},"Argentina":{"45":{"title":"Zika virus (16): Americas, Asia, research,\r\n\tobservations ","date":["17","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Zika virus (16): Americas, Asia, research,\r\n\tobservations [EXTERNAL]","summary":"\nZIKA VIRUS (16): AMERICAS, ASIA, RESEARCH, OBSERVATIONS\n*\nA ProMED-mail post\n(http://www.promedmail.org)\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n(http://www.isid.org) In this update:\n<br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Cases in various countries:\nWHO tool kit for the care and support of people affected by\ncomplications associated with Zika virus \nAmericas\n\nAmericas cumulative case numbers\nCaribbean and South America Cases in various countries not mentioned above or more recent case\nnumbers.

Update: Interim guidance\nfor health care providers caring for pregnant women with possible Zika\nvirus exposure  United States (including US Territories), July 2017.\nMMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2017; 66(29): 781-93. doi:\n10.15585/mmwr.mm6629e1\n-\nCDC has updated the interim guidance for US health care providers\ncaring for pregnant women with possible Zika virus exposure in\nresponse to 1) declining prevalence of Zika virus disease in the World\nHealth Organization's Region of the Americas (Americas) and 2)\nemerging evidence indicating prolonged detection of Zika virus\nimmunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies. Zika virus cases were 1st reported\nin the Americas during 2015-2016; however, the incidence of Zika virus\ndisease has since declined. As the prevalence of Zika virus disease\ndeclines, the likelihood of false-positive test results increases. In\naddition, emerging epidemiologic and laboratory data indicate that, as\nis the case with other flaviviruses, Zika virus IgM antibodies can\npersist beyond 12 weeks after infection. Therefore, IgM test results\ncannot always reliably distinguish between an infection that occurred\nduring the current pregnancy and one that occurred before the current\npregnancy, particularly for women with possible Zika virus exposure\nbefore the current pregnancy. These limitations should be considered\nwhen counseling pregnant women about the risks and benefits of testing\nfor Zika virus infection during pregnancy. This updated guidance\nemphasizes a shared decision-making model for testing and screening\npregnant women, one in which patients and providers work together to\nmake decisions about testing and care plans based on patient\npreferences and values, clinical judgment, and a balanced assessment\nof risks and expected outcomes. For these recommendations, the definition of possible Zika virus\nexposure has not changed and includes travel to, or residence in an\narea with risk for mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission or sex with\na partner who has traveled to or resides in an area with risk for\nmosquito-borne Zika virus transmission. These areas can be found on\nthe CDC \"Zika Travel Information\" webpage. Key recommendations include the following:\n1- All pregnant women in the United States and US territories should\nbe asked about possible Zika virus exposure before and during the\ncurrent pregnancy, at every prenatal care visit. CDC recommends that\npregnant women not travel to any area with risk for Zika virus\ntransmission. It is also recommended that pregnant women with a sex\npartner who has traveled to or lives in an area with risk for Zika\nvirus transmission use condoms or abstain from sex for the duration of\nthe pregnancy.\n2- Pregnant women with recent possible Zika virus exposure and\nsymptoms of Zika virus disease should be tested to diagnose the cause\nof their symptoms. The updated recommendations include concurrent Zika\nvirus nucleic acid test (NAT) and serologic testing as soon as\npossible through 12 weeks after symptom onset.\n3- Asymptomatic pregnant women with ongoing possible Zika virus\nexposure should be offered Zika virus NAT testing 3 times during\npregnancy. IgM testing is no longer routinely recommended because IgM\ncan persist for months after infection; therefore, IgM results cannot\nreliably determine whether an infection occurred during the current\npregnancy. The optimal timing and frequency of testing of asymptomatic\npregnant women with NAT alone is unknown. For pregnant women who have\nreceived a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection (by\neither NAT or serology positive/equivocal Zika virus or dengue virus\nIgM and Zika virus plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) 10 and\nhigher and dengue virus PRNT less than 10 results) any time before or\nduring the current pregnancy, additional Zika virus testing is not\nrecommended. For pregnant women without a prior laboratory-confirmed\ndiagnosis of Zika virus, NAT testing should be offered at the\ninitiation of prenatal care, and if Zika virus RNA is not detected on\nclinical specimens, 2 additional tests should be offered during the\ncourse of the pregnancy coinciding with prenatal visits.\n4- Asymptomatic pregnant women who have recent possible Zika virus\nexposure (that is, through travel or sexual exposure) but without\nongoing possible exposure are not routinely recommended to have Zika\nvirus testing. Testing should be considered using a shared\npatient-provider decision-making model, one in which patients and\nproviders work together to make decisions about testing and care plans\nbased on patient preferences and values, clinical judgment, a balanced\nassessment of risks and expected outcomes, and the jurisdiction's\nrecommendations. Based on the epidemiology of Zika virus transmission\nand other epidemiologic considerations (such as, seasonality),\njurisdictions might recommend testing of asymptomatic pregnant women,\neither for clinical care or as part of Zika virus surveillance. With\nthe decline in the prevalence of Zika virus disease, the updated\nrecommendations for the evaluation and testing of pregnant women with\nrecent possible Zika virus exposure but without ongoing possible\nexposure are now the same for all areas with any risk for Zika virus\ntransmission.\n5- Pregnant women who have recent possible Zika virus exposure and who\nhave a fetus with prenatal ultrasound findings consistent with\ncongenital Zika virus syndrome should receive Zika virus testing to\nassist in establishing the etiology of the birth defects. Testing\nshould include both NAT and IgM tests.\n6- The comprehensive approach to testing placental and fetal tissues\nhas been updated. Testing placental and fetal tissue specimens can be\nperformed for diagnostic purposes in certain scenarios (e.g., women\nwithout a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection and\nwho have a fetus or infant with possible Zika virus-associated birth\ndefects). However, testing of placental tissues for Zika virus\ninfection is not routinely recommended for asymptomatic pregnant women\nwho have recent possible Zika virus exposure but without ongoing\npossible exposure and who have a live born infant without evidence of\npossible Zika virus-associated birth defects.\n7- Zika virus IgM testing as part of preconception counseling to\nestablish baseline IgM results for non pregnant women with ongoing\npossible Zika virus exposure is not warranted because Zika virus IgM\ntesting is no longer routinely recommended for asymptomatic pregnant\nwomen with ongoing possible Zika virus exposure. also at the source URL above:\nAdditional interim guidance:\n- Laboratory testing of pregnant women with exposure to areas with\nrisk for Zika virus transmission\n- Prenatal management of pregnant women with laboratory evidence of\npossible Zika virus infection\n- Evaluation of placental and fetal tissue specimens for Zika virus\ninfection \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org)\nand\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be)(promed@promedmail.org) Readers interested in accessing the full report can find it at the\nsource URL above.

To evaluate the rates of acute ZIKV infection among\npatients hospitalized with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS),\nmeningoencephalitis, or transverse myelitis.\nDesign, setting, and participants. A prospective, observational cohort\nstudy was conducted at a tertiary referral center for neurological\ndiseases in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between 5 Dec 2015-10 May 2016,\namong consecutive hospitalized adults (older than 18 years of age)\nwith new-onset acute parainfectious or neuroinflammatory disease. All\nparticipants were tested for a series of arbovirosis. 3-month\nfunctional outcome was assessed.\nInterventions. Samples of serum and cerebrospinal fluid were tested\nfor ZIKV using real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain\nreaction and an IgM antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent\nassay. Clinical, radiographic (magnetic resonance imaging),\nelectrophysiological, and 3-month functional outcome data were\ncollected.\nMain outcomes and measures. The detection of neurologic complications\nsecondary to ZIKV infection.\nResults. 40 patients (15 women and 25 men; median age, 44 years\nrange, 22-72 years) were enrolled, including 29 patients (73\npercent) with GBS (90 percent Brighton level 1 certainty), 7 (18\npercent) with encephalitis, 3 (8 percent) with transverse myelitis,\nand 1 (3 percent) with newly diagnosed chronic inflammatory\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy. Of these, 35 patients (88 percent) had\nmolecular and/or serologic evidence of recent ZIKV infection in the\nserum and/or cerebrospinal fluid. Of the patients positive for ZIKV\ninfection, 27 had GBS (18 demyelinating, 8 axonal, and 1 Miller Fisher\nsyndrome), 5 had encephalitis (3 with concomitant acute neuromuscular\ndisease), 2 had transverse myelitis, and 1 had chronic inflammatory\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy. Admission to the intensive care unit was\nrequired for 9 patients positive for ZIKV infection (26 percent), and\n5 (14 percent) required mechanical ventilation. Compared with\nadmission during the period from 5 Dec 2013 - 10 May 2014 (before the\nBrazilian outbreak of ZIKV), admissions for GBS increased from a mean\nof 1.0 per month to 5.6 per month, admissions for encephalitis\nincreased from 0.4 per month to 1.4 per month, and admissions for\ntransverse myelitis remained constant at 0.6 per month. At 3 months, 2\npatients positive for ZIKV infection (6 percent) died (1 with GBS and\n1 with encephalitis), 18 (51 percent) had chronic pain, and the median\nmodified Rankin score among survivors was 2 (range, 0-5).\nConclusions and relevance. In this single-center Brazilian cohort,\nZIKV infection was associated with an increase in the incidence of a\ndiverse spectrum of serious neurologic syndromes. The data also\nsuggest that serologic and molecular testing using blood and\ncerebrospinal fluid samples can serve as a less expensive, alternative\ndiagnostic strategy in developing countries, where plaque reduction\nneutralization testing is impractical. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) This study illustrates the need to consider post-Zika virus infection\nas a cause of a variety of neurological diseases.

PLoS\nPathog. 2017; 13(8): e1006487. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006487\n-\nAbstract\n\nStudies have demonstrated cross-reactivity of anti-dengue virus (DENV)\nantibodies in human sera against Zika virus (ZIKV), promoting\nincreased ZIKV infection in vitro. However, the correlation between in\nvitro and in vivo findings is not well characterized. Thus, we\nevaluated the impact of heterotypic flavivirus immunity on ZIKV titers\nin biofluids of rhesus macaques. Animals previously infected (420 days\nor longer) with DENV2, DENV4, or yellow fever virus were compared to\nflavivirus-naïve animals following infection with a Brazilian ZIKV\nstrain. Sera from DENV-immune macaques demonstrated cross-reactivity\nwith ZIKV by antibody-binding and neutralization assays prior to ZIKV\ninfection, and promoted increased ZIKV infection in cell culture\nassays. Despite these findings, no significant differences between\nflavivirus-naïve and immune animals were observed in viral titers,\nneutralizing antibody levels, or immune cell kinetics following ZIKV\ninfection. These results indicate that prior infection with\nheterologous flaviviruses neither conferred protection nor increased\nobserved ZIKV titers in this non-human primate ZIKV infection model. Author summary\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne, emerging flavivirus. In\naddition to asymptomatic or mild febrile manifestations, ZIKV\ninfection in humans is associated with comparatively rare congenital\nand neurological abnormalities. Previous in vitro studies have\ndemonstrated cross-reactivity of antibodies derived from dengue virus\ninfections with ZIKV, as well as antibody-mediated enhancement of\ninfection in cell culture. Therefore, there is concern among\nvaccinologists and the public health community that the more severe\ndisease manifestations could result from prior immunity, either from\nnatural infection or vaccination, to antigenically-related\nflaviviruses (such as, dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis).\nIn this study, we evaluated the impact of prior immunity to dengue or\nyellow fever virus on ZIKV infection in a non-human primate model.\nAfter confirming that our immune cohorts were capable of\nrecapitulating the published in vitro observations of cross-reactivity\nand enhancement, we looked for alteration of viral titers in\nperipheral blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, and vaginal\nsecretions, as well as alterations in gross pathology, clinical\nparameters, and immune response, as compared to our flavivirus-naïve\ncohort. Importantly, no significant differences between\nflavivirus-naïve and primed animals were observed in viral titers or\nbiofluid distribution, neutralizing antibody levels, or immune cell\nkinetics following ZIKV infection. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org)\nand\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be)(promed@promedmail.org) Previous dengue infection, whether acquired naturally or antibody\nelicited by vaccines, has been a concern due to the possibility of\nantibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) with more severe disease. This\nconcern also relates to Zika virus antibody from vaccination for\nenhancement of dengue virus infections with resulting more severe\ndisease. The monkey studies reported above indicated that this may not\nbe a problem for Zika virus vaccinated individuals. Another effort to\navoid ADE is development of a vaccine that has epitopes specific for\nZika virus that are not shared by other flaviviruses.

ZIKV is also transmitted by\nsexual contact, although the relative importance of sexual\ntransmission is unclear. To better understand the role of sexual\ntransmission in ZIKV pathogenesis, a nonhuman primate (NHP) model of\nvaginal transmission was developed. ZIKV was readily transmitted to\nmature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by vaginal inoculation was\nreadily transmitted to mature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by\nvaginal individual RM with 1-5 vaginal inoculations required to\nestablish infection. After treatment with Depoprovera, a widely used\ncontraceptive progestin, 2 RM that initially resisted 8 vaginal ZIKV\ninoculations became infected after one ZIKV inoculation. Thus,\nDepoprovera seemed to enhance susceptibility to vaginal ZIKV\ntransmission. Unexpectedly, the kinetics of virus replication and\ndissemination after intravaginal ZIKV inoculation were markedly\ndifferent from RM infected with ZIKV by subcutaneous (SQ) virus\ninoculation. Several groups have reported that after SQ ZIKV\ninoculation vRNA is rapidly detected in blood plasma with vRNA less\ncommon in urine and saliva and only rarely detected in female\nreproductive tract (FRT) secretions. In contrast, in vaginally\ninoculated RM, plasma vRNA is delayed for several days and ZIKV\nreplication in, and vRNA shedding from, the FRT was found in all 6\nanimals. Further, after intravaginal transmission ZIKV RNA shedding\nfrom FRT secretions was detected before or simultaneously with plasma\nvRNA, and persisted for at least as long. Thus, ZIKV replication in\nthe FRT was independent of, and often preceded virus replication in\nthe tissues contributing to plasma vRNA. These results support the\nconclusion that ZIKV preferentially replicates in the FRT after\nvaginal transmission, but not after SQ transmission, and raise the\npossibility that there is enhanced fetal infection and pathology after\nvaginal ZIKV transmission compared to a mosquito transmitted ZIKV. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{10}</strong> _Aedes albopictus_ populations as vectors.\nDate: 2 Aug 2017.\nSource: American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (edited)\n(http://www.ajtmh.org/content/journals/10.4269/ajtmh.16-0969) \nref: Azar SR, Roundy CM, Rossi SL, et al.

Positive saliva samples were assayed for\ninfectious titer. Although all 3 mosquito populations were susceptible\nto all ZIKV strains, rates of infection, dissemination, and\ntransmission differed among mosquito and virus strains. _Aedes\nalbopictus_ from Salvador, Brazil, were the least efficient vectors,\ndemonstrating susceptibility to infection to 2 American strains of\nZIKV but failing to shed virus in saliva.

The study above goes the next step\ntoward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_\nfed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in\nsaliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing.\nThe study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a\ncompetent vector. Several other studies have shown this species to be\ninefficient vectors or refractory to Zika virus infection. One wonders\nif the specific _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ used or the Zika virus isolates\nwith which they were tested could account for these very different\nresults. Resolving these discrepancies is important because this\nmosquito species is very widely distributed around the world and bears\ndirectly on risk of outbreaks in geographic areas where _Aedes\naegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_ , Zika virus vectors, do not occur. -\nMod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"72":{"title":"Chikungunya (27) - Americas, Europe, Asia ","date":["18","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Chikungunya (27) - Americas, Europe, Asia [EXTERNAL]","summary":"\nCHIKUNGUNYA (27) - AMERICAS, EUROPE, ASIA\n*\nA ProMED-mail post\n(http://www.promedmail.org)\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n(http://www.isid.org) In this update:\nCases in various countries:\nRegional summaries\n\nAmericas\n\nRegional summary\nWHO/PAHO report Mexico and Central America\n\nMexico (Jalisco state)\nCosta Rica South America\n\nArgentina (Salto province)\nBrazil:\n- Roraima state\n- Ceara state\nPeru (Piura region) Europe\n\nFrance (Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region in Provence) Asia\n\nTaiwan (Tainan)\nIndia:\n- Delhi\n- Ludhiana, Punjab\n- Chandigarh, Haryana and Punjab states\n- Tamil Nadu state\n- Baramati tehsil, Pune, Maharastra state\n- Pune Maharashtra state ex Assam state\n- Kerala state\nBangladesh (Dhaka)\nNepal (Bhaktapur, province 3) \nCases in various countries:\nRegional summaries\n\nAmericas\n\nWHO/PAHO report\n18 Aug 2017\n(http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_topics&view=rdmore&cid=8975&Itemid=40931&lang=en) \nReported cases of chikungunya fever in the Americas, by country or\nterritory - 2017 to EW 33 week ending 18 Aug 2017.

Date: Tue 15 Aug 2017. Source: Phys.org (edited) (https://phys.org/news/2017-08-human-intrusion-fruit-habitats-exposure.html)   There is a rising risk of human and domestic animal exposure to deadly Hendra virus (HeV) carried by fruit bats in Eastern Australia due to human intrusion into their habitats, human proximity to woodlands and vegetation loss, a new study reveals.  Reported today Tue 15 Aug 2017 in Scientific Reports by researchers from the University of Sydney, University of Melbourne and State University of New York, the study traces how pressures such as expanding human populations, urbanization and forest fragmentation altered the shape and size of the habitats of pteropid fruit bats (flying foxes) in the decades between 1980 and 2015.  In recent years, bats from the Pteropodidae family have been pinpointed as 'natural reservoirs' of several emerging zoonotic viruses, such as Hendra virus (HeV), Nipah (NiV) and Ebola, which can cause death in humans.  Pteropid fruit bats carry HeV without becoming ill. Research has shown the black flying fox (Pteropus alecto) and the spectacled flying fox (_Pteropus conspicillatus_) harbor the infectious HeV and can shed HeV particles in their urine.  Their suitability as reservoirs has been linked to their capacity for flight, adaptability to different food sources, population structure, longevity and immune function. \"Pteropid fruit bats are essential pollinators and seed distributors in tropical and subtropical forests,\" says Dr Michael Walsh of the University of Sydney's Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity, who led the study.  \"Human-caused changes in their habitat exemplify the precarious balance between ecosystem integrity and human public health.  \"The opportunity for the transmission of animal-borne viruses to human populations arises when these changes in natural habitats create new configurations of ecosystems and animal populations that subsequently generate increased or unprecedented contact between human, domestic animal and wildlife communities.\"  Hendra virus was 1st identified during the 1st recorded outbreak of the disease in the Brisbane suburb of Hendra, Australia, in 1994. The outbreak involved 21 stabled racehorses and 2 human cases.  This newly emerging infectious disease made several further sporadic occurrences between 1994 and 2010 until in 2011 an unprecedented number of 18 distinct 'spillovers' more than doubled the number of known incidents.  A spillover event is defined as transmission of a pathogen such as HeV from a reservoir such as a pteropid fruit bat to a domestic animal such as a horse. It also includes pathogen transmission from an infected domestic animal such as a horse to a human.  As of August 2017, there have been 60 known outbreaks of Hendra resulting in the death of 102 horses, all occurring in the north-eastern coastal region of Australia.  To date, 7 humans have contracted HeV in spillover events arising from the care or autopsy of ill or dead horses. Of those who tested positive for HeV, 4 died of the disease, including 2 veterinarians.  \"The epidemiology of HeV spillover events indicates that expanding suburban communities may draw foraging flying foxes from nearby forest ranges into encroaching residential and community gardens and thereby, closer to horses,\" Dr Walsh says.  The researchers did 2 sets of analyses to assess whether an expansion of the HeV reservoir was associated with an increasing trend in spillover risk.  First, they modeled changes in 1713 geo-located sightings of pteropid fruit bats P. alecto and P. conspicillatus at 3 different time points between 1980 and 2015 in response to factors such as climate, topography, and human migration in the preceding decade.  They found that rainfall, altitude, temperature, and human migration were highly associated with decadal changes in the ecological niche (as measured by sightings) of the black flying fox and the spectacled flying fox.  \"The predicted habitat suitability for HeV reservoir pteropids expands geographically southward along the eastern coast of Australia from the earliest period in 1980-1989 to the latest in 2000-2015,\" Dr Walsh says.  \"These changes predict that southeastern Queensland and northeastern NSW show consistently high habitat suitability, while advancing toward and beyond Sydney. There is also a corridor along the northern coast of the Northern Territory that shows a high degree of predicted habitat suitability.\"  In their 2nd analysis, the researchers assessed whether HeV infections in horses and humans (spillover incidents) between 2000 and 2015 were associated with decadal changes in the ecological niche (as measured by sightings) of _P. alecto_ and _P. conspicillatus_ from 1980 to 2015.  They found a high association between the 2, meaning the inter-decadal expanding reservoir niche of pteropid fruit bats was highly associated with a concurrent increasing trend for risk of HeV infections in humans.  Furthermore, the risk of HeV infection increased threefold as the ecological niche expanded along the coast in Queensland and NSW during the 1st 2 decades under study (1980-1999) and increased further still as habitat suitability continued to change from 2000-2015.  \"The shared history between HeV spillover and the ecological niche of flying foxes notwithstanding, reservoir habitat suitability alone was insufficient to describe the spatial dependence of HeV spillover,\" says Dr Walsh.  \"The human footprint, proximity to woody savanna, and vegetation loss were additional components of the landscape required to adequately describe the spatial dependence of spillover across eastern Australia.\"  The findings supported the researchers' hypothesis that the risk for HeV infection in Eastern Australia between 2000 and 2015 was associated with changes in the ecological niche of pteropid fruit bats in the decades between 1980 and 2015.  Furthermore, this risk was highly associated with human intrusion into their habitats, human proximity to woodlands and vegetation loss.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  This would mean horse owners need to be especially wary of the equine habitat where their horses are kept. Build shelters over the water troughs and fence off the fruit trees that attract the bats. Furthermore, the likelihood of veterinarians being exposed from treating horses could mean that vaccination for the horse could become mandatory. - Mod.TG  See: \"The Hendra vaccine: your questions answered\", Equine Veterinarians Australia, Australia Veterinary Association at (http://www.ava.com.au/sites/default/files/EVA%20website/ResourcesDownloads/The%20Hendra%20Vaccine%20-%20Your%20Questions%20Answered%20-%20Updated%20January%202016.pdf). - Mod.ML  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/186).

There have been 14 cases of the highly infectious disease identified by Queensland Health since 24 Jul 2017, compared to the yearly average of only one case in the Cairns and Hinterland health district.  Tropical Public Health director Dr Steven Donohue said the mumps outbreak had spilled over to Cairns from northwest Queensland and the Northern Territory's Top End.  \"Outbreaks of mumps mainly occur because of low vaccination rates, missed doses in the past, waning immunity, or pressure of infection in overcrowded households,\" he said.  He said the viral illness was spread just like influenza, by coughing or sneezing near other people and through unwashed hands.  \"Symptoms may occur around 2 weeks after exposure if the person is not immune,\" he said. \"The illness usually lasts between 5-9 days.  \"One person in 3 who contracts mumps does not have any symptoms and doesn't realise they are sick, but they may still be contagious and infect may other people.\"  Northern Queensland Primary Health Network chief executive Robin Moore said immunisation was a simple, safe and highly effective way to protect children and adults from preventable diseases like mumps.  \"This year's 2017 increase in the number of mumps cases in the Cairns region is a timely reminder to parents that immunisation is the best protection against preventable diseases such as these.  \"We urge all members of the community to be fully vaccinated.\" ..  The disease is uncommon in developed countries, including Australia, because of the widespread use of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine.  This is given to children at 12 and 18 months, but free catch-up doses are available to anyone born after 1965 who may not have 2 recorded doses.

Source: Stuff (edited) (http://tinyurl.com/y7a56fv5)   University of Otago students are being offered free booster shots after about 10 confirmed or suspected cases were reported in Dunedin Otago, South Island.  Three young people in Marlborough have contracted the contagious illness, with at least 1 case linked to an Auckland outbreak, while 2 have been confirmed in Nelson.  Nationally, an unusually high number of cases were reported from September 2016 to early 2017, and the Ministry of Health warned of \"an increased risk of further outbreaks\".  Auckland reported 51 cases of mumps in the past month  most aged 10 to 19  while several were recorded in Waikato earlier this year 2017.  The Auckland Regional Public Health Service said last month July 2017 it was concerned not enough people were immunised in the face of the mumps outbreak.  The MMR vaccine is usually given in 2 doses, one at 15 months old and one at 4 years old.  Most people recover from mumps, but it can have serious complications. The disease can cause inflammation of tissue surrounding the brain (meningitis), inflamed testicles or ovaries and deafness.  Men hospitalised from the Auckland outbreak had pain and swelling in their testicles, known as orchitis, which in rare cases may lead to infertility.  The outbreak in Dunedin has prompted the Otago tertiary institution's student health team to offer free measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) booster shots to students who have not had two MMR vaccinations since 1990, or are unsure of their vaccination history.  Pro-vice-chancellor of health sciences Professor Peter Crampton, the convener of the university's pandemic planning group, said the group was \"determining our ongoing response as the situation develops.\"  The outbreak coincided with a large-scale boil water notice issued for parts of Dunedin, including the student quarter, after untreated water got into part of the town's drinking water supply on Mon 14 Aug 2017.  All students and staff had been sent information about mumps. Information had been posted on social media.  Marlborough medical officer of health Dr Andrew Lindsay said mumps is \"highly contagious\". It spreads through the air by breathing, coughing and sneezing, or through contact with infected saliva; by kissing or sharing food and drink. It usually takes 12-25 days before symptoms appear  including pain in the jaw, fever, headache, and swollen glands around the face and body. People with mumps re infectious for 7 days before swelling starts and for 5 days after they cease.  Personal hygiene is essential to avoid catching mumps, including frequent hand washing, stopping coughs and sneezes in tissues, keeping at least 1 metre 3 ft away from others and ensuring kitchens and bathrooms are clean.  Dr Jill Sherwood, public health physician with the ESR (the Institute of Environmental Science and Research), earlier said the MMR vaccine was not as effective in mumps as it was in measles and rubella. \"The mumps component is only about 85 per cent effective, whereas the measles component will most likely give you lifetime coverage,\" Sherwood said.  There have been no reported cases of mumps in Canterbury, a health board spokeswoman said.

The measles outbreak in Romania in 2016 is not circumstantial, but a\ndirect consequence of the \"major\" malfunctions in public policy\nregarding vaccination, minister of health Florian Bodog stated on Fri\n11 Aug in a press release. \"For years now Romania has been below the\nsafety threshold of vaccination coverage. That is, the risk of a\nmeasles outbreak was imminent. Which is what actually happened. The\noutbreak of the measles epidemic in 2016 is not conjectural, it is a\ndirect consequence of major malfunctions in the public policy on\nvaccination,\" the minister of health stated. According to him, the Vaccination Law corrects the irregularities that\nled to the epidemic, providing the best conditions for protecting\nchildren's health. \"For Romania, the stake of the vaccination bill is\nhuge. Ensuring a healthy future for 4 million children lies in our\nhands. The Romanian parliament, the highest institution of democracy,\nwill decide on the final content of this law. However, beyond the\ndebates in parliament, it is important that all the public opinion be\ninformed and understand the true meaning of the law and the profound\nchanges it brings. (..) We have a moral duty towards our children, to\nprevent harm before it happens. As we also have a moral duty to the\ncommunity in which we live to prevent harm before it happens to other\nchildren or parents,\" Bodog said, quoted in the press release. He added that any bill is amendable and that is why it is open to any\npublic debates as long as they are carried out with honesty, good\nsense and decency. \"But this project is the day-to-day work of\nspecialists in the field of vaccination and who have faced all the\nflaws of the current framework. That is why the law has been carefully\nand correctly thought through by those who best understand how to\nregulate the vaccination policy,\" the minister of health also said. The bill on the organisation and funding of public vaccination in\nRomania was adopted by the government on Wed 9 Aug 2017. The bill\nwas submitted to parliament for debate and adoption. The normative act\nwould come into force on 1 Jan 2018. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) A similar report can be found in El Pais (12 Aug 2017) which states\nin addition that, of the 95 per cent vaccine coverage recommended by\nthe World Health Organization (WHO), 86 per cent have been\nvaccinated since 2007, according to its national epidemiological\ncentre. \"Highly worrying\" figures, acknowledged the prime minister,\nMihai Tudose, this week. \"More than 180 000 children in our country,\nfrom 9 months to 9 years, are not immunized against measles.

The index case had just returned from visiting family in the Ukraine\nwhere he likely contracted the disease. When he returned to Israel he\nvisited a clinic where he infected 8 other soldiers who were waiting\nin line to see a physician. \"The IDF, together with the Health\nMinistry, carried out an investigation to locate the cases and\nidentify the source of the infection,\" the army said in a statement,\nadding that all those who had contact with the soldiers had been\ngiven preventative treatment. An IDF spokesman told The Jerusalem Post\nthat the soldier who contracted the disease had 2 stopovers in Europe\non his way back to Israel from the Ukraine but was not able to specify\nwhich countries. WHO in March 2017 warned of a measles outbreak sweeping across\nEurope in places where immunization rates have plummeted. The figures\ncover the agency's entire European region  53 countries including\nIsrael, Kazakhstan, and Russia. According to WHO 559 measles cases\nwere reported in Europe between January and March 2017. While the\nlargest current measles outbreaks in Europe were reported in Romania\nand Italy, other countries reporting cases were France, Germany,\nPoland, Switzerland, and the Ukraine. \"With steady progress toward\nelimination over the past 2 years, it is of particular concern that\nmeasles cases are climbing in Europe,\" said Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO\nregional director for Europe. \"Today's travel patterns put no person\nor country beyond the reach of the measles virus. Outbreaks will\ncontinue in Europe, as elsewhere, until every country reaches the\nlevel of immunization needed to fully protect their populations.\" Israeli children are routinely immunized with the MMR measles, mumps,\nrubella vaccine which are given in 2 doses, at 1 year and a booster\nin the 1st grade. The Health Ministry has stated that the level of\nvaccine coverage in Israel is among the highest in the West, with 97\nper cent coverage for 1st and 2nd doses MMR and chickenpox vaccine. While no vaccine is 100 per cent effective, an infectious disease\nspecialist told the Post that measles is \"a nasty illness\" that is\npreventable by proper immunization. But while it is highly recommended\nby medical professionals and the Health Ministry, the vaccine is not\nmandatory and according to the IDF the measles vaccine is not part of\nthe vaccines given to new recruits. \"We cannot afford to have soldiers\nwho are severely ill with a highly contagious disease. It would be\nappropriate for the IDF to verify and update immunizations of all\npersonnel and new recruits,\" the infectious disease specialist told\nthe Post. Measles is spread by coughing and sneezing and close contact with\ninfected individuals. While most infected people usually experience\nonly mild symptoms it is one of the leading causes of death among\nyoung children globally. Measles takes about 8-12 days following\ncontact before the individual will show symptoms which include a\nfever, bad cough, red eyes, and a runny nose. A few days after the\nrespiratory symptoms, the infected individual will get a bad rash.\nOther complications of measles include gastroenteritis (diarrhea and\nvomiting), pneumonia, severe bleeding problems, and in some rare cases\nencephalitis (brain infections). In June 2017, 5 cases of measles were reported to the Health\nMinistry  all of them women between the ages of 20-40 who lived in\nJerusalem. byline: Anna Ahronheim \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) Even with 97 per cent vaccine coverage, measles virus can cause small\noutbreaks.

Measles is an airborne disease that affects mostly children between\nthe ages of 6 months and 10 years, although it can also affect\nadults. Although Prof Mbonye said there was no cause for alarm, he urged the\npublic to be vigilant and report any suspected cases to the nearest\nhealth facilities. The public has also been urged to look out for\ncommon early symptoms associated with the disease, which include high\nfever, cough, red swelling eyelids and muscle and body irritability. According to the Ministry of Health, an estimated 20 per cent of\npeople who get infected with measles often develop complications,\nwhich if not managed early enough can lead to death. Despite previous\nmass vaccination campaigns, Uganda has had several outbreaks of the\ndisease. Prof Mbonye blamed it on parents who do not take their\nchildren for immunisation at the right time. Current national\nimmunisation coverage stands at 85 per cent. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) According to WHO, in 2016 global vaccination coverage (all vaccines)\nwas stalled at 86 per cent, with no significant changes during the\npast year. For measles alone, by the end of 2016, 85 per cent of\nchildren had received 1 dose of vaccine by their 2nd birthday, and 164\ncountries had included a 2nd dose as part of routine immunization; 64\nper cent of children received 2 doses of measles vaccine according to\nnational immunization schedules.

The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare is advising tourists to go to hospital if they develop a high fever or generalized rash after returning to Japan.  Although the World Health Organization verified that Japan has eliminated infections of endemic measles strains in 2015, group infections originating from people who contracted the disease abroad are spreading in the country. As of 6 Aug 2017, the number of patients reached 169 this year in Japan, already eclipsing the figure in the previous year.  About 4100 patients in Italy and around 6500 patients in Romania have already been confirmed as of August 2017 compared with about 860 and 2000, respectively, throughout 2016, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.  Symptoms of the highly contagious disease include runny nose, red and watery eyes, high fever, and rash. The virus is spread through coughing and sneezing and can cause complications such as pneumonia and can even result in death in one in 1000 patients, according to the ministry. The ministry recommends people traveling overseas to check their vaccination records and take an additional shot if they have only been vaccinated once.  The disease was prevalent about a decade ago in Japan with the number of patients soaring to over 10 000 in 2008 but the country was later considered as free from infections of the virus.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Japan can be found at (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/156). - Mod.LK   <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Australia (Perth, Western Australia): ex Italy.

Large measles outbreak introduced by asylum seekers and spread among the insufficiently vaccinated resident population, Berlin, October 2014 to August 2015. Euro Surveill. 2017; 22(34): pii=30599 - Abstract  The largest measles outbreak in Berlin since 2001 occurred from October 2014 to August 2015. Overall, 1344 cases were ascertained, 86 per cent (with available information) unvaccinated, including 146 (12 per cent) asylum seekers. Median age was 17 years (interquartile range: 4-29 years), 26 per cent were hospitalised and a 1 year old child died. Measles virus genotyping uniformly revealed the variant 'D8-Rostov-Don' and descendants. The virus was likely introduced by and initially spread among asylum seekers before affecting Berlin's resident population. Among Berlin residents, the highest incidence was in children younger than 2 years, yet most cases (52 per cent) were adults. Post-exposure vaccinations in homes for asylum seekers, not always conducted, occurred later (median: 7.5 days) than the recommended 72 hours after onset of the 1st case and reached only half of potential contacts. Asylum seekers should not only have non-discriminatory, equitable access to vaccination, they also need to be offered measles vaccination in a timely fashion, that is, immediately upon arrival in the receiving country. Supplementary immunisation activities targeting the resident population, particularly adults, are urgently needed in Berlin.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail.

A 10 month old girl, who was a refugee from Iraq, became the 33rd person to die of the infection, reports local Digi24. The girl arrived in Romania on 7 Jul 2017 with her family, and the doctors diagnosed her with measles in August. They also discovered that the child was suffering from malnutrition and severe psychomotor retardation.  The measles outbreak is still a major problem in Romania, with more than 8900 cases reported across the country until 25 Aug 2017, including 33 deaths, according to data from the National Center for Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases (CNSCBT). Most deaths were registered in Timis (9), Dolj (7), and Arad (6) counties.  Measles is a highly contagious respiratory infection caused by a virus. It causes a total-body skin rash and flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough, and runny nose. According to information posted on WHO's website, the virus is highly contagious, spreading by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact, and direct contact with infected nasal or throat secretions. Unvaccinated young children pose the highest risk of measles and its complications, including death.  The Romanian Government adopted earlier this month August 2017 a draft bill on the organization and financing of population vaccination (https://www.romania-insider.com/romania-draft-bill-vaccination/). The project was sent to the Parliament for approval and could come into force in January 2018.  byline: Irina Marica   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Measles tends to be more severe in children who are malnourished, especially children who are also vitamin A deficient. And complications are commoner and more serious in malnourished children. Because of complications such as diarrhoea, measles may lead to failure to thrive. Infection with measles virus may lead to kwashiorkor or marasmus in children who are underweight at the time that they get infected. Therefore, measles may result in, or aggravate, malnutrition.

Source: News-Medical/Life Sciences (edited) (https://www.news-medical.net/news/20170826/New-study-highlights-role-played-by-demographics-in-the-spread-of-measles.aspx)   Even if the incidence of measles infection has decreased by at least 90 per cent worldwide since the introduction of the vaccine, measles is still one of the major causes of death in children among vaccine-preventable diseases. Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world.  A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries.  Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years.  \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\"  \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea\".  The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years 2 million DALYs since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln 13 million DALYs in the US, and 36-mln 36 million DALYs in Ethiopia.  \"Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,\" continues Prof Melegaro \"our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population.

This came about after 2\nkidney recipients in Taiwan were diagnosed with dengue 2 days after\nreceiving a kidney each from the same donor, said National Cheng Kung\nUniversity microbiology and immunology professor Dr Oscar Perng\nGuey-chuen. \"This indicates a potential risk,\" the Taiwan-based\nscientist said, adding that no dengue virus was detected in the\ndonor's blood. He said the donor contracted dengue in 2015 and in mid-2016, he died\nin an accident. His family donated his corneas, liver, heart, and\nkidneys. Both patients had the same strain of the dengue virus the\ndonor had in 2015 and one of the recipients died of dengue\nhaemorrhagic fever, he said. Asked where the virus could be hiding since it could not be detected\nin the blood, he said it was a question scientists are trying to\nanswer. Interestingly, those who received the donor's corneas, liver,\nand heart did not develop dengue, Dr Perng said on the sidelines of\nthe National Dengue And Arboviruses Infection Conference 2017\nyesterday 12 Aug 2017. He said although there was not enough\nevidence to show the virus came from the donor as the kidneys were not\ntested for dengue before the transplant, the same virus was found in\nthe patients' bodies after that. Dr Perng said his team had studied mice for dengue virus in the blood\ntestes, kidney, liver, spleen and brain, and found the virus present\nin the kidneys and brain. \"We believe the virus probably resided in\nthe kidneys and was not cleared by the body,\" he said, adding that the\nvirus could have been activated after transplant. He said this raised\nconcerns about asymptomatic people who are dengue carriers. Health Ministry deputy director, general Datuk Dr S Jeyaindran said\npatients with severe dengue would have better recovery if they were\ngiven colloids, a more concentrated fluid, at the early stage in fluid\nmanagement for dengue patients. Dr Jeyaindran, who was representing\nHealth Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam, said colloids may be\nintroduced at an earlier stage, instead of saline because it has not\nbeen successful in treating patients with severe dengue. He said more\nstudies will be conducted to find out at which stage the colloids\nshould be given. byline: Loh Foon Fong \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) - Air travel related spread of dengue.\nDate: Thu 3 Aug 2017.\nSource: Medical Xpress (edited)\n(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-08-air-responsible-dengue-asia.html) \nWhile the incidences of many other infectious diseases have declined\nover the past decade, the number of cases and outbreaks of dengue\nvirus have continued to increase. The spread of dengue to new areas is\nlikely due in large part to trends in air travel, researchers now\nreport in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Dengue virus affects as estimated 390 million people around the globe\neach year, and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild fever and\nheadache to severe low blood pressure. The virus has mostly caused\ndisease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, but a 2014\noutbreak in Japan broke that pattern. Overall, the geographic area\naffected by dengue has been growing in recent years. In the new work, Huaiyu Tian and Bing Xu, both of Beijing Normal\nUniversity, China, together with colleagues from the University of\nOxford and elsewhere analyzed the spread of dengue viruses in Asia\nfrom 1956 to 2015. They used 2202 genetic sequences of dengue viruses,\ncollected in 20 countries or regions of Asia over the 59 years, to\ndetermine how different strains were related. They also investigated\ntrends in air travel, maritime mobility, migration, and\nsocio-economics to determine what factors impact the spread of\ndengue. The spread of 3 different dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1, -2, and -3,\nis associated with air traffic more so than any other factors, the\ndata revealed. Air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India, the\nresearchers found, help seed dengue epidemics, while China, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, and Singapore help diffuse the virus to other Asian\ncountries. \"Future trends in global mobility could potentially accelerate the\nappearance and diffusion of DENV worldwide,\" the researchers say.\n\"Prevention and control of dengue epidemics requires a better\nunderstanding of its mode of geographic dissemination, especially for\ncountries in the tropics.\" Reference: Tian H, Sun Z, Faria NR, et al.

Source: Farm Online (edited) (http://www.farmonline.com.au/story/4875310/fungal-disease-reappears-after-40-years/)   Farmers in the Victorian Wimmera and the Upper South East of South Australia are set to be confronted with a fungal disease they have not seen at damaging levels since the 1970s. Septoria tritici blotch has built up to levels that could cause significant damage this year 2017.  Agriculture Victoria cereal pathologist Grant Hollaway said septoria is now the major fungal disease issue in south-west Victoria. \"It has really emerged as a problem over the past five or six years.\" He said the major threat would be in the medium rainfall zone where the disease had not been spotted for many years. \"Septoria was common in the Wimmera in low levels last year 2016 and this has provided the carryover inoculum.\"  There are parallels in septoria's reappearance after a lengthy absence with that of stripe rust, which Dr Hollaway said returned to Victoria in 2003 following a 20 year hiatus. \"It is more of a stripe rust in terms of the damage it can cause,\" he said.  Byline: Gregor Heard   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  Septoria leaf blotch of cereals is caused by fungi in the septoria species complex, which includes _Zymoseptoria tritici_ (previously _Septoria tritici_), _Mycosphaerella graminicola_ and _Phaeosphaeria nodorum_ (previously _Stagonospora nodorum_). They affect mainly wheat, but also barley and oats and occasionally rye and some grass species. Symptoms on wheat and barley are very similar and may occur at any time during the growth cycle and on any portion of the plant. They include blotches on both leaves and glumes, which reduce the photosynthetic ability of the host. Disease development is favoured by humid conditions. Up to 50 per cent yield losses have been reported on susceptible varieties.  Spores can be spread by infected plant material, wind, water (rain splash) and mechanical means. The pathogens can overwinter on crop debris and on autumn sown crops or volunteers. Disease management includes fungicide treatments aimed at preventing the disease becoming established on the upper 3 leaves of the crop canopy (where it would affect the ears most), removal of inoculum sources and use of resistant varieties. After the cereal rusts, the disease is considered the most important challenge to plant breeders (see ProMED-mail post http://promedmail.org/post/20120831.1274190) and a threat to food security worldwide.  Pathogen strains with high levels of resistance to many fungicides are emerging, for example, in the UK and other parts of Europe (ProMED-mail post http://promedmail.org/post/20160516.4225677), as well as Australia and New Zealand (ProMED-mail posts http://promedmail.org/post/20161031.4598540, http://promedmail.org/post/20140417.2410219). In Australia, STB was reported as the 1st wheat disease developing fungicide resistance on that continent (ProMED-mail post http://promedmail.org/post/20140313.2329774). The possibility cannot be excluded that the re-emergence of STB in eastern Australia may be due to new fungal strains which have adapted to local conditions.  Stripe rust (_Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_), also mentioned above, can result in yield losses of 40 to 100 per cent. New strains with increased virulence are emerging and this disease is currently causing the most damage to wheat crops on a global scale.

LL) is a major cause of serious human gastrointestinal illness and have the potential to cause life-threatening complications, such as hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) (1). An average of 0.4 cases of EHEC illness per 100 000 persons per year are reported to public health authorities in Australia (2). Disease severity can range from asymptomatic infection to serious and sometimes fatal illness, particularly in young children and the elderly (3,4).  Healthy ruminants, particularly cattle, are the reservoir for EHEC (5). Human infection with EHEC usually occurs as a result of inadvertent ingestion of fecal matter after consumption of contaminated food, water, or unpasteurized milk; contact with animals or their environments; or secondarily, through contact with infected humans (4,5). In the largest previously reported outbreak of EHEC illness in Australia in 1995, which was associated with consumption of mettwurst (uncooked, semidry, fermented sausages), HUS developed in 23 of the 51 case-patients identified, and there was 1 death (6).  The Study  A multidisciplinary incident management team was established to investigate an outbreak of EHEC illness associated with an annual agricultural show in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, in August 2013. The incident management team defined primary and secondary outbreak cases. Persons with laboratory-confirmed EHEC infection associated with the outbreak and their household contacts were followed up until the point of microbiological evidence of clearance, which was defined as 2 consecutive negative stool samples collected more than 24h apart (7).  Case-patients and contacts with a high risk for transmission (persons under 5 years of age; persons unable to maintain good hygiene; or childcare, healthcare, aged care, or food preparation workers) were advised to avoid childcare and work settings in accordance with Queensland Health Guidelines (7). Enhanced surveillance measures were implemented to assist with case finding. Medical practitioners were requested to avoid use of antimicrobial drugs for suspected case-patients with EHEC infections because of previously reported associations between antimicrobial drug use and HUS. We developed a case-control study to obtain additional information related to animal contact, hand hygiene, and food consumption at the agricultural show. We analyzed data by using Epi Info 7 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA). EHEC identified from human, environmental, and animal samples were serotyped for O and H antigens. Expression of Shiga toxin 1 (stx1) and stx2 genes was determined for selected isolates. Shiga toxin gene subtyping and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis was performed.  During 21 Aug 2013 to 27 Sep 2013, we identified 57 outbreak-associated laboratory-confirmed case-patients with EHEC infection: 54 confirmed primary case-patients, 1 probable primary case-patient, and 2 secondary case-patients (Figure 1 for figures, see original URL - Mod. LL). Of the 57 cases-patients, 32 (56 percent) were female. Case-patients ranged in age from 1 to 77 (median 9) years; 31 (56 percent) case-patients were (10 years of age. Median incubation period after attending the agricultural show was 4 (range 1-11, 25th-75th percentile 3-5) days. Case-patients reported diarrhea (96 percent), abdominal pain (93 percent), bloody diarrhea (41 percent), and fever (32 percent) (Table 1). A total of 7 case-patients were hospitalized. No cases of HUS or deaths were reported.  Public Health Units followed up 40 case-patients until microbiological evidence of clearance; the remaining case-patients were lost to follow up. Median duration of EHEC excretion among primary case-patients was 18 (range 2-52) days (Table 2). After 27 days and 6 recurrent stools positive for EHEC, and after acute diarrheal illness had resolved, 1 child was given azithromycin on day 40 for 3 days to hasten decolonization. 2 consecutive stool specimens obtained more than 48 h after treatment with antimicrobial drugs was stopped were negative for EHEC in this child. This patient did not have any adverse effects from azithromycin treatment.  A total of 45 of 55 primary case-patients and 28 household contacts who attended the agricultural show were included in the case-control study. Median age of case-patients was 8 (range 1-77) years, and median age of controls was 38 (range 1-70) years. We showed by using univariate analysis that case-patients were not more likely than controls to have entered the animal nursery at the show. Case-patients were more likely than controls to have had contact with lambs or goats, fed the animals, or had their hands licked by animals.  We identified the same multilocus variable number tandem repeat and stx subtype genotype of _E. coli_ O157:H- in human case-patients, animal bedding from the animal nursery before disposal, and fecal samples collected from lambs, goats, and calves. WGS and read mapping to an _E. coli_ O157 reference genome showed that of the human, animal, and environmental isolates analyzed, all contained an IS1203v insertion that resulted in deletion of the first 494 bp of the stx2c subunit A gene (Figure 2). Expression of stx2 was not detected in these isolates by Immunocard STAT! EHEC (Meridian Bioscience, Cincinnati, OH, USA) and Shiga toxin Quik Chek (Alere, Waltham, MA, USA) lateral flow devices. No additional stx2 genes were identified, and no disruptions were detected in the stx1 gene regions of any of the isolates.  Conclusions  We found that EHEC infection was associated with feeding lambs or goats, feeding animals, and having the hands licked by animals. The course of _E. coli_ O157 infection was relatively mild; no cases of HUS were associated with this outbreak. Heiman et al. found that of 4928 cases of 390 _E. coli_ O157 illness outbreaks in the USA during 2003-2012, HUS was detected in 299 cases (6 percent of illnesses) (8). HUS cases with stx1+/stx2 _E. coli_ O157 isolates have been reported (9,10). We speculate that the absence of severe complications in this outbreak might have been caused, in part, by disruption of the stx2 subunit A gene by the IS1203v insertion, which resulted in lack of expression or a nonfunctional Stx2 toxin.  The proportion of case-patients reporting bloody diarrhea (19/46, 41 percent) was also lower than previously reported. Ethelberg et al. reported that 69 percent (56/81) of case-patients in Denmark infected with _E. coli_ O157 had bloody diarrhea (11). A recent retrospective cohort study reported that 61 percent (2027/3323) of symptomatic case-patients infected with _E. coli_ O157 Public Health England had bloody diarrhea. Bloody diarrhea was reported to be a risk factor for HUS (odds ratio 2.10; p = 0.001) (12). In the outbreak we studied, children under 5 years of age were less likely than older children and adults to report bloody diarrhea. EHEC infection should be actively considered for young children with non-bloody diarrhea who were exposed to potential sources of EHEC.  In this outbreak, 1 child was given azithromycin for 3 days to hasten decolonization some weeks after the acute diarrheal illness had resolved. Antimicrobial drugs are generally not recommended to hasten EHEC decolonization because of major associations with HUS (13). Recommendations to avoid high risk activities (such as childcare attendance) might place a major socioeconomic burden on EHEC carriers and their families. Further studies are required to assess whether WGS can provide useful information for safe administration of antimicrobial drugs for treatment of acute illness caused by EHEC, or when chronic shedding becomes established.  Our comprehensive study of a large outbreak _E. coli_ O157 illness, characterized by an IS1203v insertion disrupting the stx2c subunit A gene, showed mild clinical illness and an absence of HUS. Further characterization by virulence studies on isolates with this stx2c subunit A gene disruption might provide further insights into the mild illness caused by this strain.  References - 1.

It may well be the case that the IS1203v insertion that resulted in deletion of the first 494 bp of the stx2c subunit A gene may have been the cause of milder illness. Regarding azithromycin use, azithromycin and the carbapenem antimicrobial class are among a small group of antibacterials that do not appear to precipitate a higher risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome. Azithromycin was used for late clearance of the EHEC here and I have had anecdotal experience doing the same thing in an asymptomatic chronic carrier of EHEC O157 without any adverse effects. - Mod.LL  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/285).

Date: Tue 29 Aug 2017 21:06 (http://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2017-08-29/bluetongue-line-moves-south-in-the-nt/8848908)   Approximately 20 new properties within Central Australia and the Barkly now fall within the bluetongue virus zone within the Northern Territory, according to the Department of Primary Industry.  Changes to the zone, introduced last month July 2017, mean 10 of those additional properties are within the transmission zone, and 10 within the surveillance zone.  Bluetongue is an insect borne, non-contagious viral disease, and the changes mean properties affected will not be able to export to a number of markets that have restrictions in place, such as China and Turkey.  Peter Saville, senior veterinary officer in Alice Springs with the Department, said in his 14 years working in the area, the line was the lowest he had ever seen it.  \"What we found is that a number of properties north of the Alice Springs districts have had cattle which have seroconverted, which means that they've been exposed to the bluetongue virus, and those properties are much further south than they normally are.\"  Weather to blame According to Mr Saville, the change earlier in the year was due to a summer of high temperatures and high rainfall, resulting in the increased number of insects. \"It is insect movement that controls this, and as such there's not a lot we can do, so we just have to wait and see, we can't speculate on what might happen,\" he said.  Mr Saville said ownership changes could affect zoning.  \"One of the things that has contributed to this is a lot of properties have amalgamated their pics property identification codes because they're now under one ownership, and that means that even if part of their property is in a zone then the whole of the property is regarded as being in that zone.\"  Fluid line movement However Mr Saville said the line could once again move north depending on weather.  \"We wait until the end of summer, the end of the transmission season, and then we go out and test a number of properties to find out if there's been any evidence of viral activity.  \"Once those results are in, the NAMP National Arbovirus Monitoring Program committee meets and decides where the blue tongue line is going to go, and where the limits of the zones are.\"  Mr Saville said producers should visit the Animal Health Australia website if they want more information about the changes, and contact their livestock agent.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)   <br><br><strong>{2}</strong>. Date: Thu 30 Aug 2017. From: Mark Shipp (Mark.Schipp@agriculture.gov.au) (edited)   The National Arbovirus Monitoring Program (NAMP) maps areas in Australia where bluetongue virus transmission occurs, using both sentinel herds and additional sampling of herds when mustered.  Sentinel herds are bled and tested regularly, however in very remote areas where sentinel herds are not practical, cattle are sampled during the annual muster.  Bluetongue viral transmission occurs in parts of Australia but disease has not been reported.  There is a buffer zone between the zone where bluetongue virus transmission can occur and the zone free of bluetongue virus transmission. This is called the surveillance zone and is 50 Km 31.06 mi wide. The distance maintained between records of viral transmission and the boundary of the free zone is always maintained at a distance of 100 km 62.13 and follows property boundaries.  Yearly variation in the distribution of the main insect vector Culicoides brevitarisis means that the NAMP records some variation in the zone boundary from year to year. The map was most recently updated on Wed 16 Aug 2017. Detection of viral transmission immediately results in a zone expansion however zone contraction requires 2 years of negative surveillance results. The variations in the boundary are generally small and are considered routine. The NT example is confounded by changes in the management of land that have seen the amalgamation of properties. Because the zone boundary follows property boundaries this has exaggerated the zone extension. Property sizes can be extensive; up to 12 000 square km 4633.22 square miles in some cases.  There can be a lag period observed between viral transmission and antibody detection, particularly where surveillance is based on sampling mustered animals rather than sentinel herds. This maybe where the confusion has arisen in the quoted media report. Sero-conversion was detected in winter but arose from insect activity earlier in the season. The media report is inaccurate in relation to market access.  Recently negotiated conditions with China allow access for Australian feeder and slaughter cattle raised in areas where bluetongue virus transmission can occur. Parts of China record transmission of bluetongue virus year round and most of China (like parts of Australia) experiences times in the year where bluetongue viral transmission can occur (seasonal transmission).  The bulk of cattle in the Northern Territory are exported to markets that are endemic for bluetongue and while export conditions are applied, they are generally not trade restrictive.  The report of the zone expansion is publically available through the NAMP web site that is hosted on the Animal Health in Australia Web site.  It is certainly true that some markets require animals to be sourced from bluetongue virus free areas. This is the main reason that the NAMP program is maintained as it provides access for Australian cattle to these markets by confirming a zone free from viral transmission.  Objectives of the NAMP are: 1. Market access - to facilitate the export of live cattle, sheep and goats, and ruminant genetic material, to countries with concerns about bluetongue, Akabane and bovine ephemeral fever (BEF) viruses 2. Bluetongue early warning - to detect incursions of exotic strains of bluetongue virus (BTV) and vectors (Culicoides species biting midges) into Australia by surveillance of the northern BTV epidemic area. 3. Risk management - to detect changes in the seasonal distribution in Australia of endemic bluetongue, Akabane and BEF viruses and their vectors, to support livestock exporters.   Mark Schipp Chief Veterinary Officer (Australia) OIE Delegate (Australia) Vice-President OIE Assembly 7 London Cct, Canberra ACT 2600 GPO Box 858, Australia (mark.schipp@agriculture.gov.au)  In previous situations the line has been moved to reflect the seroconverstion, not actual disease discoveries. I reached out to Dr Schipp with some questions. Below are our question and answers:  ProMED-mail moderator (hence PMM): It appears this is a standard line movement based on seroconverstion - without actual disease? Could you clarify for me please?  Dr Schipp: Yes this is a regular adjustment of line to reflect seroconverstion with clinical disease.  PMM: Also the way this article is written is a bit confusing to me. As it is late August/1st of September, so I am thinking you may in late winter/early spring, yet the article above talks about frosts in the winter?  Dr Schipp: The hope expressed by Dr Saville is that the frosts currently being experienced in the central Austral winter will deplete the number of _Culicoides_ able to over winter to then become abundant in the spring and summer.  ProMED-mail thanks Dr Schipp for his promt reply and for taking the time to clarify issues regarding the surveillance line.  Information for understanding Bluetongue. Bluetongue virus (BTV) can and does affect cattle.  The disease is caused by an orbivirus belonging to the family _Reoviridae_. There are 25 serotypes of bluetongue virus and 10 of these have been isolated in Australia. Orbiviruses are insect-borne viruses (arboviruses) transmitted by _Culicoides_ midges. Many other non bluetongue orbiviruses are also endemic in Australia.  Bluetongue is an insect-borne, viral disease that can affect sheep, goats, deer, and cattle. Sheep are the most seriously affected species; clinical disease and mortalities occur and production and trade losses may result. Most infections in cattle are unapparent.  A number of bluetongue serotypes are present in Australia, but the severe clinical disease seen in other countries has not occurred here. Disease has been produced in experimentally infected sheep with some serotypes present in Australia.  Bluetongue virus serotype 1 was 1st identified in Australia in 1975 from trapped insects in the Northern Territory (NT) but despite its long-term presence, it has not caused any clinical disease. Since that time 9 more serotypes have been isolated in the NT. The distribution of BTV in Australia has been monitored in the National Arbovirus Monitoring Program (NAMP) for many years and the zones of BTV virus transmission and freedom are mapped and updated regularly on the Animal Health Australia website. - Mod.TG  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/292).

Risk Factors Associated with Blood Exposure for Sporadic Hepatitis E in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2017 Aug 14. doi: 10.4269/ajtmh.17-0261.  Abstract  Fecal contamination of drinking water is associated with large hepatitis E virus (HEV) outbreaks of genotypes 1 and 2 in endemic areas. Sporadic transmission of HEV genotypes 3 and 4 in high-income countries has been associated with exposure to blood and animal contact. The objective of the study was to identify the risk factors for hepatitis E and the genotype(s) causing sporadic hepatitis E in Dhaka, Bangladesh. We selected, from a diagnostic center in Dhaka between November 2008 and November 2009, cases presenting with jaundice and anti-HEV IgM antibodies and age-matched controls were defined as those with no history of jaundice and normal blood test results. Serum samples were tested for HEV RNA using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction followed by a sequencing and phylogenetic analysis.  \nA total of 109 cases and 109 controls were enrolled. The cases were more likely to be male (adjusted matched odds ratios mOR 2.2, 95 percent CI: 1.2-3.9; P = 0.01), or have reported contact with another person's blood or blood product, or contact with blood-contaminated sharp instruments (adjusted mOR 2.1, 95 percent CI: 1.1-4.1; P = 0.03) than controls. There were no significant differences between the cases and the controls in terms of reported high-risk sexual intercourse, consumption of undercooked meat, or contact or drinking fecally-contaminated water. The sera from 3 cases carried HEV RNA, all belonging to genotype 1. Findings from this study suggest that contact with human blood and sharing sharp instruments may transmit sporadic hepatitis E in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Efforts to prevent the transmission of blood-borne pathogens may also prevent sporadic HEV transmission in this endemic setting.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-SoAs (promed-SoAs@promedmail.org)  There has been increased interest, especially in Europe, of assessing the risk of HEV transmission via blood transfusion in order to assess the need for routine screening. Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis E is generally self-limited without a chronic phase but it is clear, especially with genotype 3 that chronic infection may occur. This is particularly true in individuals with cellular immunodeficiencies such as those who are solid organ transplant recipients and those infected with HIV. - Mod.LL  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/153).

Given the\noutbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections in the region, and the\nclinical similarity of cases of that virus infection and CHIKV\ninfection, one wonders how many cases that were not laboratory\nconfirmed but clinically diagnosed as ZIKV infections were, in\nreality, CHIKV infections. It is also possible that a significant\nproportion of the population have been infected by CHIKV in the\nprevious 3 years and are now immune. It seems likely, however, that\nCHIKV is now endemic in the Americas, and sporadic, small outbreaks\nmay continue to occur as they do in Asia and Africa. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Barbados":{},"Belarus":{"175":{"title":"African swine fever - Europe (21): Czech Rep, Romania,\r\n\tPoland, wild boar, spread ","date":["31","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH/EDR> African swine fever - Europe (21): Czech Rep, Romania,\r\n\tPoland, wild boar, spread [EXTERNAL]","summary":"\nAFRICAN SWINE FEVER - EUROPE (21): CZECH REPUBLIC, ROMANIA, POLAND,\nWILD BOAR, SPREAD\n*\nA ProMED-mail post\n(http://www.promedmail.org)\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n(http://www.isid.org) In this posting:\n<br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Czech Rep, Romania\n<br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Poland, fence considered \n<br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Czech Rep, Romania.\nDate: Wed 30 Aug 2017.\nSource: Pig Progress net (edited)\n(http://www.pigprogress.net/Health/Articles/2017/8/ASF-update-Czech-Republic-approaches-100-reports-177268E/) \nAlthough the outbreaks seem to be contained to one region of the Czech\nRepublic, African Swine Fever ASF continues to make victims among\nthe country's wild boar population. The total amount of dead wild boars discovered in the woods around\nZlín, in the far east of the Czech Republic, stood at 94 at the end\nof August 2017. In this month, 23 new infected carcasses were found,\nwhich is a downward trend from July 2017, when 68 reports were sent\nto the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). The 1st report of\nASF in Czech wild boars was on Wed 21 Jun 2017. Many neighbouring countries have alerted their local pig producers to\nbe very careful what to feed their pigs - and their inhabitants what\nto purchase and how to dispose of it. So did Slovakia, according to\nthe Slovak Spectator. Zlín is only a few km away from the western\nSlovak border, to its north is Poland where ASF has been around since\n2014 and on its eastern border is Ukraine, where ASF has been\nconfirmed since 2011. In a presentation, given in mid-July 2017 to the European\nCommission's Standing Committee On Animals, Plants, Food and Feed\n(SCoPAFF), Dr Petr Šatrán of the Czech State Veterinary\nAdministration indicated that human activities are most likely the\ncause of the spread of the virus, seeing that the nearest reported\ncases of ASF were roughly 500 km 310.68 mi away and that the\npositive dead wild boars were found in inhabited areas. In the other country where ASF was found for the 1st time in 2017,\nRomania, things appear relatively quiet. News broke early this month\nAugust 2017 that ASF was also found on 2 backyard farms in the north\nof the country. Ever since, the Romanian authorities did not report\nany further outbreaks of ASF to the OIE. Of all other countries in the European Union, especially Poland has\ncontinued to report outbreaks of African Swine Fever in smaller and\nmiddle-sized operations. In August alone, on 23 farm sites of various\nsizes, ASF was found to have infected at least one animal, after which\nthe entire herd would have to be culled. The biggest operation in this respect was a farm near Monki, Podlaskie\nprovince, where all remaining 431 pigs had to be culled after 11 had\ndied as a result of ASF, on Sat 19 Aug 2017. Noteworthy as well was\nthe ASF-related closure of 2 farms in Lack, Lubelskie province, in\nearly August. These farms had 136 and 141 pigs respectively see also\nitem 2.

This was said by Poland's Minister of Agriculture,\nKrzysztof Yurgel, Niezalezna reports. As reported, the length of the fence will be 729 km 452.98 mi,\ncosting Poland 130 million zloties (more than 36.2 million USD). The\nfinal decision on a fence will be made within the next 3 weeks. According to experts, ASF has developed in the territory of Poland\n\"thanks to\" the wild boars who entered from Belarus. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) The accumulated ASF OIE data from Poland as of Thu 31 Aug 2017, are\nas follows (start of event 22 May 2014):\nNumber of follow-up reports: 189\nTotal outbreaks: 550 (Submitted)\nSpecies/ Susceptible/ Cases/ Deaths/ Killed and disposed of/\nSlaughtered\nWild boar/ - / 620 / 620 / 0 / 0\nDomestic Swine/ 6303/ 402/ 188/ 6097/ 0 A map showing ASF cases reported globally to the OIE since 1 Jan 2017,\nas of Thu 31 Aug 2017, is available at (http://tinyurl.com/ybexasqm).\nClick on the European cluster, zoom in to each of the countries of\ninterest. EU disease control measures require designation of risk areas as Part\nI (wild boar at risk, but no cases found), Part II (wild boar testing\npositive but no spill over into domestic pigs), Part III (cases in\nwild boar and occasional spill over into domestic pigs) and Part IV\nwhich concerns the island of Sardinia only. Consignments of live pigs,\nlive wild boars, meat of either source and animal by-products of\neither source are only allowed under certain derogations. For a full\nexplanation, see European Commission Implementing Decision\n2014/708/EU. ASF, a viral disease against which no vaccine has become available so\nfar, is currently threatening central and western Europe, where dense\npopulations of wild boar are present. According to a recent update of DEFRA (UK) ASF situation assessment,\nthe continuing cases in the Czech Republic, the spread in Poland which\nappears to be due to several breakdowns in biosecurity and the new\noutbreaks in Romania are \"concerning\". This signifies a spread in\ngeographic distribution, a possible drop in biosecurity awareness and\ntherefore an increase in the weight of infection in East Europe. Despite the relatively low level of trade in live pigs, there could be\na substantial movement of people, vehicles and personal imports of\npork products, therefore the risk of ASF introduction to the UK has\nbeen raised from \"very low\" (that is, \"rare but could occur\") to\n\"low\". The Russian veterinary watchdog Rosselkhoznadzor believes ASF will\nkeep moving west via 2 main pathways. The southerly route, has already\nseen the virus spread from Ukraine to Moldova. Russian vets believe it\ncould penetrate central Romania, then move to the Balkans, including\nBulgaria and Serbia. On the northern route, now that ASF has been found in the Czech\nRepublic, Rosselkhoznadzor believes, if it gains a foothold, it is\nlikely to head further west, with Germany next in the firing line. The\nsaid is included in a recent update by the Russian journalist\nVladislav Vorotnikov, available at\n(http://www.pig-world.co.uk/comment/where-next-for-african-swine-fever.html).\n- Mod.AS ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Belgium":{"45":{"title":"Zika virus (16): Americas, Asia, research,\r\n\tobservations ","date":["17","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Zika virus (16): Americas, Asia, research,\r\n\tobservations [EXTERNAL]","summary":"\nZIKA VIRUS (16): AMERICAS, ASIA, RESEARCH, OBSERVATIONS\n*\nA ProMED-mail post\n(http://www.promedmail.org)\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n(http://www.isid.org) In this update:\n<br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Cases in various countries:\nWHO tool kit for the care and support of people affected by\ncomplications associated with Zika virus \nAmericas\n\nAmericas cumulative case numbers\nCaribbean and South America Cases in various countries not mentioned above or more recent case\nnumbers.

Update: Interim guidance\nfor health care providers caring for pregnant women with possible Zika\nvirus exposure  United States (including US Territories), July 2017.\nMMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2017; 66(29): 781-93. doi:\n10.15585/mmwr.mm6629e1\n-\nCDC has updated the interim guidance for US health care providers\ncaring for pregnant women with possible Zika virus exposure in\nresponse to 1) declining prevalence of Zika virus disease in the World\nHealth Organization's Region of the Americas (Americas) and 2)\nemerging evidence indicating prolonged detection of Zika virus\nimmunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies. Zika virus cases were 1st reported\nin the Americas during 2015-2016; however, the incidence of Zika virus\ndisease has since declined. As the prevalence of Zika virus disease\ndeclines, the likelihood of false-positive test results increases. In\naddition, emerging epidemiologic and laboratory data indicate that, as\nis the case with other flaviviruses, Zika virus IgM antibodies can\npersist beyond 12 weeks after infection. Therefore, IgM test results\ncannot always reliably distinguish between an infection that occurred\nduring the current pregnancy and one that occurred before the current\npregnancy, particularly for women with possible Zika virus exposure\nbefore the current pregnancy. These limitations should be considered\nwhen counseling pregnant women about the risks and benefits of testing\nfor Zika virus infection during pregnancy. This updated guidance\nemphasizes a shared decision-making model for testing and screening\npregnant women, one in which patients and providers work together to\nmake decisions about testing and care plans based on patient\npreferences and values, clinical judgment, and a balanced assessment\nof risks and expected outcomes. For these recommendations, the definition of possible Zika virus\nexposure has not changed and includes travel to, or residence in an\narea with risk for mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission or sex with\na partner who has traveled to or resides in an area with risk for\nmosquito-borne Zika virus transmission. These areas can be found on\nthe CDC \"Zika Travel Information\" webpage. Key recommendations include the following:\n1- All pregnant women in the United States and US territories should\nbe asked about possible Zika virus exposure before and during the\ncurrent pregnancy, at every prenatal care visit. CDC recommends that\npregnant women not travel to any area with risk for Zika virus\ntransmission. It is also recommended that pregnant women with a sex\npartner who has traveled to or lives in an area with risk for Zika\nvirus transmission use condoms or abstain from sex for the duration of\nthe pregnancy.\n2- Pregnant women with recent possible Zika virus exposure and\nsymptoms of Zika virus disease should be tested to diagnose the cause\nof their symptoms. The updated recommendations include concurrent Zika\nvirus nucleic acid test (NAT) and serologic testing as soon as\npossible through 12 weeks after symptom onset.\n3- Asymptomatic pregnant women with ongoing possible Zika virus\nexposure should be offered Zika virus NAT testing 3 times during\npregnancy. IgM testing is no longer routinely recommended because IgM\ncan persist for months after infection; therefore, IgM results cannot\nreliably determine whether an infection occurred during the current\npregnancy. The optimal timing and frequency of testing of asymptomatic\npregnant women with NAT alone is unknown. For pregnant women who have\nreceived a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection (by\neither NAT or serology positive/equivocal Zika virus or dengue virus\nIgM and Zika virus plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) 10 and\nhigher and dengue virus PRNT less than 10 results) any time before or\nduring the current pregnancy, additional Zika virus testing is not\nrecommended. For pregnant women without a prior laboratory-confirmed\ndiagnosis of Zika virus, NAT testing should be offered at the\ninitiation of prenatal care, and if Zika virus RNA is not detected on\nclinical specimens, 2 additional tests should be offered during the\ncourse of the pregnancy coinciding with prenatal visits.\n4- Asymptomatic pregnant women who have recent possible Zika virus\nexposure (that is, through travel or sexual exposure) but without\nongoing possible exposure are not routinely recommended to have Zika\nvirus testing. Testing should be considered using a shared\npatient-provider decision-making model, one in which patients and\nproviders work together to make decisions about testing and care plans\nbased on patient preferences and values, clinical judgment, a balanced\nassessment of risks and expected outcomes, and the jurisdiction's\nrecommendations. Based on the epidemiology of Zika virus transmission\nand other epidemiologic considerations (such as, seasonality),\njurisdictions might recommend testing of asymptomatic pregnant women,\neither for clinical care or as part of Zika virus surveillance. With\nthe decline in the prevalence of Zika virus disease, the updated\nrecommendations for the evaluation and testing of pregnant women with\nrecent possible Zika virus exposure but without ongoing possible\nexposure are now the same for all areas with any risk for Zika virus\ntransmission.\n5- Pregnant women who have recent possible Zika virus exposure and who\nhave a fetus with prenatal ultrasound findings consistent with\ncongenital Zika virus syndrome should receive Zika virus testing to\nassist in establishing the etiology of the birth defects. Testing\nshould include both NAT and IgM tests.\n6- The comprehensive approach to testing placental and fetal tissues\nhas been updated. Testing placental and fetal tissue specimens can be\nperformed for diagnostic purposes in certain scenarios (e.g., women\nwithout a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection and\nwho have a fetus or infant with possible Zika virus-associated birth\ndefects). However, testing of placental tissues for Zika virus\ninfection is not routinely recommended for asymptomatic pregnant women\nwho have recent possible Zika virus exposure but without ongoing\npossible exposure and who have a live born infant without evidence of\npossible Zika virus-associated birth defects.\n7- Zika virus IgM testing as part of preconception counseling to\nestablish baseline IgM results for non pregnant women with ongoing\npossible Zika virus exposure is not warranted because Zika virus IgM\ntesting is no longer routinely recommended for asymptomatic pregnant\nwomen with ongoing possible Zika virus exposure. also at the source URL above:\nAdditional interim guidance:\n- Laboratory testing of pregnant women with exposure to areas with\nrisk for Zika virus transmission\n- Prenatal management of pregnant women with laboratory evidence of\npossible Zika virus infection\n- Evaluation of placental and fetal tissue specimens for Zika virus\ninfection \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org)\nand\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be)(promed@promedmail.org) Readers interested in accessing the full report can find it at the\nsource URL above.

To evaluate the rates of acute ZIKV infection among\npatients hospitalized with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS),\nmeningoencephalitis, or transverse myelitis.\nDesign, setting, and participants. A prospective, observational cohort\nstudy was conducted at a tertiary referral center for neurological\ndiseases in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between 5 Dec 2015-10 May 2016,\namong consecutive hospitalized adults (older than 18 years of age)\nwith new-onset acute parainfectious or neuroinflammatory disease. All\nparticipants were tested for a series of arbovirosis. 3-month\nfunctional outcome was assessed.\nInterventions. Samples of serum and cerebrospinal fluid were tested\nfor ZIKV using real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain\nreaction and an IgM antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent\nassay. Clinical, radiographic (magnetic resonance imaging),\nelectrophysiological, and 3-month functional outcome data were\ncollected.\nMain outcomes and measures. The detection of neurologic complications\nsecondary to ZIKV infection.\nResults. 40 patients (15 women and 25 men; median age, 44 years\nrange, 22-72 years) were enrolled, including 29 patients (73\npercent) with GBS (90 percent Brighton level 1 certainty), 7 (18\npercent) with encephalitis, 3 (8 percent) with transverse myelitis,\nand 1 (3 percent) with newly diagnosed chronic inflammatory\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy. Of these, 35 patients (88 percent) had\nmolecular and/or serologic evidence of recent ZIKV infection in the\nserum and/or cerebrospinal fluid. Of the patients positive for ZIKV\ninfection, 27 had GBS (18 demyelinating, 8 axonal, and 1 Miller Fisher\nsyndrome), 5 had encephalitis (3 with concomitant acute neuromuscular\ndisease), 2 had transverse myelitis, and 1 had chronic inflammatory\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy. Admission to the intensive care unit was\nrequired for 9 patients positive for ZIKV infection (26 percent), and\n5 (14 percent) required mechanical ventilation. Compared with\nadmission during the period from 5 Dec 2013 - 10 May 2014 (before the\nBrazilian outbreak of ZIKV), admissions for GBS increased from a mean\nof 1.0 per month to 5.6 per month, admissions for encephalitis\nincreased from 0.4 per month to 1.4 per month, and admissions for\ntransverse myelitis remained constant at 0.6 per month. At 3 months, 2\npatients positive for ZIKV infection (6 percent) died (1 with GBS and\n1 with encephalitis), 18 (51 percent) had chronic pain, and the median\nmodified Rankin score among survivors was 2 (range, 0-5).\nConclusions and relevance. In this single-center Brazilian cohort,\nZIKV infection was associated with an increase in the incidence of a\ndiverse spectrum of serious neurologic syndromes. The data also\nsuggest that serologic and molecular testing using blood and\ncerebrospinal fluid samples can serve as a less expensive, alternative\ndiagnostic strategy in developing countries, where plaque reduction\nneutralization testing is impractical. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) This study illustrates the need to consider post-Zika virus infection\nas a cause of a variety of neurological diseases.

We found that ZIKV\npersistently infects brain endothelial cells that normally protect\nneurons from viral exposure. hBMECs are not damaged by ZIKV infection\nand, analogous to persistent HCV infection, ZIKV constitutively\ninduces and evades antiviral ISG IFN-stimulated genes and IFN\ninterferon responses to continuously replicate in hBMECs. As a\nresult, hBMECs provide a protective niche for systemic ZIKV spread and\na viral reservoir localized in the normally protective blood-brain\nbarrier. Consistent with the spread of ZIKV into neuronal\ncompartments, ZIKV was released basolaterally from hBMECs. Our\nfindings define hBMEC responses that contribute to persistent ZIKV\ninfection and potential targets for clearing ZIKV infections from\nhBMECs.

PLoS\nPathog. 2017; 13(8): e1006487. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006487\n-\nAbstract\n\nStudies have demonstrated cross-reactivity of anti-dengue virus (DENV)\nantibodies in human sera against Zika virus (ZIKV), promoting\nincreased ZIKV infection in vitro. However, the correlation between in\nvitro and in vivo findings is not well characterized. Thus, we\nevaluated the impact of heterotypic flavivirus immunity on ZIKV titers\nin biofluids of rhesus macaques. Animals previously infected (420 days\nor longer) with DENV2, DENV4, or yellow fever virus were compared to\nflavivirus-naïve animals following infection with a Brazilian ZIKV\nstrain. Sera from DENV-immune macaques demonstrated cross-reactivity\nwith ZIKV by antibody-binding and neutralization assays prior to ZIKV\ninfection, and promoted increased ZIKV infection in cell culture\nassays. Despite these findings, no significant differences between\nflavivirus-naïve and immune animals were observed in viral titers,\nneutralizing antibody levels, or immune cell kinetics following ZIKV\ninfection. These results indicate that prior infection with\nheterologous flaviviruses neither conferred protection nor increased\nobserved ZIKV titers in this non-human primate ZIKV infection model. Author summary\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne, emerging flavivirus. In\naddition to asymptomatic or mild febrile manifestations, ZIKV\ninfection in humans is associated with comparatively rare congenital\nand neurological abnormalities. Previous in vitro studies have\ndemonstrated cross-reactivity of antibodies derived from dengue virus\ninfections with ZIKV, as well as antibody-mediated enhancement of\ninfection in cell culture. Therefore, there is concern among\nvaccinologists and the public health community that the more severe\ndisease manifestations could result from prior immunity, either from\nnatural infection or vaccination, to antigenically-related\nflaviviruses (such as, dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis).\nIn this study, we evaluated the impact of prior immunity to dengue or\nyellow fever virus on ZIKV infection in a non-human primate model.\nAfter confirming that our immune cohorts were capable of\nrecapitulating the published in vitro observations of cross-reactivity\nand enhancement, we looked for alteration of viral titers in\nperipheral blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, and vaginal\nsecretions, as well as alterations in gross pathology, clinical\nparameters, and immune response, as compared to our flavivirus-naïve\ncohort. Importantly, no significant differences between\nflavivirus-naïve and primed animals were observed in viral titers or\nbiofluid distribution, neutralizing antibody levels, or immune cell\nkinetics following ZIKV infection. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org)\nand\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be)(promed@promedmail.org) Previous dengue infection, whether acquired naturally or antibody\nelicited by vaccines, has been a concern due to the possibility of\nantibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) with more severe disease. This\nconcern also relates to Zika virus antibody from vaccination for\nenhancement of dengue virus infections with resulting more severe\ndisease. The monkey studies reported above indicated that this may not\nbe a problem for Zika virus vaccinated individuals. Another effort to\navoid ADE is development of a vaccine that has epitopes specific for\nZika virus that are not shared by other flaviviruses.

Nat\nCommun. 2017; 8: 15672. doi: 10.1038/ncomms15672\n-\nAbstract\n\nZika virus (ZIKV), a re-emerging flavivirus associated with\nneurological disorders, has spread rapidly to more than 70 countries\nand territories. However, no specific vaccines or antiviral drugs are\ncurrently available to prevent or treat ZIKV infection. Here we report\nthat a synthetic peptide derived from the stem region of ZIKV envelope\nprotein, designated Z2, potently inhibits infection of ZIKV and other\nflaviviruses in vitro. We show that Z2 interacts with ZIKV surface\nprotein and disrupts the integrity of the viral membrane. Z2 can\npenetrate the placental barrier to enter fetal tissues and is safe for\nuse in pregnant mice. Intraperitoneal administration of Z2 inhibits\nvertical transmission of ZIKV in pregnant C57BL/6 mice and protects\ntype I or type I/II interferon receptor-deficient mice against lethal\nZIKV challenge. Thus, Z2 has potential to be further developed as an\nantiviral treatment against ZIKV infection in high-risk populations,\nparticularly pregnant women. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall It will be interesting to see if the same protective effect occurs\nwhen tested with Zika virus infections of non-human primates. -\nMod.TY \n<br><br><strong>{9}</strong> Female reproductive tract infection.\nDate: Wed 26 Jul 2017.\nSource: PLoS (Public Library of Science) Pathogens (edited)\n(http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006537) \nCarroll T, Lo M, Lanteri M, et al.

PLoS Pathog. 2017; 13(7): e1006537. doi:\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1006537\n-\nAbstract\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted virus that can cause\nsevere defects in an infected fetus. ZIKV is also transmitted by\nsexual contact, although the relative importance of sexual\ntransmission is unclear. To better understand the role of sexual\ntransmission in ZIKV pathogenesis, a nonhuman primate (NHP) model of\nvaginal transmission was developed. ZIKV was readily transmitted to\nmature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by vaginal inoculation was\nreadily transmitted to mature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by\nvaginal individual RM with 1-5 vaginal inoculations required to\nestablish infection. After treatment with Depoprovera, a widely used\ncontraceptive progestin, 2 RM that initially resisted 8 vaginal ZIKV\ninoculations became infected after one ZIKV inoculation. Thus,\nDepoprovera seemed to enhance susceptibility to vaginal ZIKV\ntransmission. Unexpectedly, the kinetics of virus replication and\ndissemination after intravaginal ZIKV inoculation were markedly\ndifferent from RM infected with ZIKV by subcutaneous (SQ) virus\ninoculation. Several groups have reported that after SQ ZIKV\ninoculation vRNA is rapidly detected in blood plasma with vRNA less\ncommon in urine and saliva and only rarely detected in female\nreproductive tract (FRT) secretions. In contrast, in vaginally\ninoculated RM, plasma vRNA is delayed for several days and ZIKV\nreplication in, and vRNA shedding from, the FRT was found in all 6\nanimals. Further, after intravaginal transmission ZIKV RNA shedding\nfrom FRT secretions was detected before or simultaneously with plasma\nvRNA, and persisted for at least as long. Thus, ZIKV replication in\nthe FRT was independent of, and often preceded virus replication in\nthe tissues contributing to plasma vRNA. These results support the\nconclusion that ZIKV preferentially replicates in the FRT after\nvaginal transmission, but not after SQ transmission, and raise the\npossibility that there is enhanced fetal infection and pathology after\nvaginal ZIKV transmission compared to a mosquito transmitted ZIKV. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{10}</strong> _Aedes albopictus_ populations as vectors.\nDate: 2 Aug 2017.\nSource: American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (edited)\n(http://www.ajtmh.org/content/journals/10.4269/ajtmh.16-0969) \nref: Azar SR, Roundy CM, Rossi SL, et al.

Positive saliva samples were assayed for\ninfectious titer. Although all 3 mosquito populations were susceptible\nto all ZIKV strains, rates of infection, dissemination, and\ntransmission differed among mosquito and virus strains. _Aedes\nalbopictus_ from Salvador, Brazil, were the least efficient vectors,\ndemonstrating susceptibility to infection to 2 American strains of\nZIKV but failing to shed virus in saliva. Mosquitoes from the Rio\nGrande Valley were the most efficient vectors and were capable of\nshedding all 3 tested ZIKV strains into saliva after 14 days of\nextrinsic incubation. In particular, ZIKV strain DakAR 41525 (Senegal\n1954) was significantly more efficient at dissemination and saliva\ndeposition than the others tested in Rio Grande mosquitoes. Overall,\nour data indicate that, while _Ae. albopictus_ is capable of\ntransmitting ZIKV, its competence is potentially dependent on\ngeographic origin of both the mosquito population and the viral\nstrain. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) This study illustrates that fact that not all Zika virus strains and\n_Ae. albopictus_ populations are created equal in terms of efficiency\nof transmission of this virus.

Zika virus replication in\nthe mosquito _Culex quinquefasciatus_ in Brazil. Emerg Microbes\nInfect. 2017; 6(8): e69. doi: 10.1038/emi.2017.59\n-\nAbstract\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has recently been associated\nwith an increased incidence of neonatal microcephaly and other\nneurological disorders. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito\nbite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some\ncases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main\nvector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other\nmosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the\nvirus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit\nZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of\nlaboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_.\nInterestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the\nmidgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in\nRecife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially\nfed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced.\nCollectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range\nof ZIKV vectors than anticipated. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be) Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active\nvirus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their\nability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step\ntoward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_\nfed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in\nsaliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing.\nThe study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a\ncompetent vector. Several other studies have shown this species to be\ninefficient vectors or refractory to Zika virus infection. One wonders\nif the specific _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ used or the Zika virus isolates\nwith which they were tested could account for these very different\nresults. Resolving these discrepancies is important because this\nmosquito species is very widely distributed around the world and bears\ndirectly on risk of outbreaks in geographic areas where _Aedes\naegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_ , Zika virus vectors, do not occur. -\nMod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Belize":{"45":{"title":"Zika virus (16): Americas, Asia, research,\r\n\tobservations ","date":["17","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Zika virus (16): Americas, Asia, research,\r\n\tobservations [EXTERNAL]","summary":"\nZIKA VIRUS (16): AMERICAS, ASIA, RESEARCH, OBSERVATIONS\n*\nA ProMED-mail post\n(http://www.promedmail.org)\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n(http://www.isid.org) In this update:\n<br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Cases in various countries:\nWHO tool kit for the care and support of people affected by\ncomplications associated with Zika virus \nAmericas\n\nAmericas cumulative case numbers\nCaribbean and South America Cases in various countries not mentioned above or more recent case\nnumbers.

Update: Interim guidance\nfor health care providers caring for pregnant women with possible Zika\nvirus exposure  United States (including US Territories), July 2017.\nMMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2017; 66(29): 781-93. doi:\n10.15585/mmwr.mm6629e1\n-\nCDC has updated the interim guidance for US health care providers\ncaring for pregnant women with possible Zika virus exposure in\nresponse to 1) declining prevalence of Zika virus disease in the World\nHealth Organization's Region of the Americas (Americas) and 2)\nemerging evidence indicating prolonged detection of Zika virus\nimmunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies. Zika virus cases were 1st reported\nin the Americas during 2015-2016; however, the incidence of Zika virus\ndisease has since declined. As the prevalence of Zika virus disease\ndeclines, the likelihood of false-positive test results increases. In\naddition, emerging epidemiologic and laboratory data indicate that, as\nis the case with other flaviviruses, Zika virus IgM antibodies can\npersist beyond 12 weeks after infection. Therefore, IgM test results\ncannot always reliably distinguish between an infection that occurred\nduring the current pregnancy and one that occurred before the current\npregnancy, particularly for women with possible Zika virus exposure\nbefore the current pregnancy. These limitations should be considered\nwhen counseling pregnant women about the risks and benefits of testing\nfor Zika virus infection during pregnancy. This updated guidance\nemphasizes a shared decision-making model for testing and screening\npregnant women, one in which patients and providers work together to\nmake decisions about testing and care plans based on patient\npreferences and values, clinical judgment, and a balanced assessment\nof risks and expected outcomes. For these recommendations, the definition of possible Zika virus\nexposure has not changed and includes travel to, or residence in an\narea with risk for mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission or sex with\na partner who has traveled to or resides in an area with risk for\nmosquito-borne Zika virus transmission. These areas can be found on\nthe CDC \"Zika Travel Information\" webpage. Key recommendations include the following:\n1- All pregnant women in the United States and US territories should\nbe asked about possible Zika virus exposure before and during the\ncurrent pregnancy, at every prenatal care visit. CDC recommends that\npregnant women not travel to any area with risk for Zika virus\ntransmission. It is also recommended that pregnant women with a sex\npartner who has traveled to or lives in an area with risk for Zika\nvirus transmission use condoms or abstain from sex for the duration of\nthe pregnancy.\n2- Pregnant women with recent possible Zika virus exposure and\nsymptoms of Zika virus disease should be tested to diagnose the cause\nof their symptoms. The updated recommendations include concurrent Zika\nvirus nucleic acid test (NAT) and serologic testing as soon as\npossible through 12 weeks after symptom onset.\n3- Asymptomatic pregnant women with ongoing possible Zika virus\nexposure should be offered Zika virus NAT testing 3 times during\npregnancy. IgM testing is no longer routinely recommended because IgM\ncan persist for months after infection; therefore, IgM results cannot\nreliably determine whether an infection occurred during the current\npregnancy. The optimal timing and frequency of testing of asymptomatic\npregnant women with NAT alone is unknown. For pregnant women who have\nreceived a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection (by\neither NAT or serology positive/equivocal Zika virus or dengue virus\nIgM and Zika virus plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) 10 and\nhigher and dengue virus PRNT less than 10 results) any time before or\nduring the current pregnancy, additional Zika virus testing is not\nrecommended. For pregnant women without a prior laboratory-confirmed\ndiagnosis of Zika virus, NAT testing should be offered at the\ninitiation of prenatal care, and if Zika virus RNA is not detected on\nclinical specimens, 2 additional tests should be offered during the\ncourse of the pregnancy coinciding with prenatal visits.\n4- Asymptomatic pregnant women who have recent possible Zika virus\nexposure (that is, through travel or sexual exposure) but without\nongoing possible exposure are not routinely recommended to have Zika\nvirus testing. Testing should be considered using a shared\npatient-provider decision-making model, one in which patients and\nproviders work together to make decisions about testing and care plans\nbased on patient preferences and values, clinical judgment, a balanced\nassessment of risks and expected outcomes, and the jurisdiction's\nrecommendations. Based on the epidemiology of Zika virus transmission\nand other epidemiologic considerations (such as, seasonality),\njurisdictions might recommend testing of asymptomatic pregnant women,\neither for clinical care or as part of Zika virus surveillance. With\nthe decline in the prevalence of Zika virus disease, the updated\nrecommendations for the evaluation and testing of pregnant women with\nrecent possible Zika virus exposure but without ongoing possible\nexposure are now the same for all areas with any risk for Zika virus\ntransmission.\n5- Pregnant women who have recent possible Zika virus exposure and who\nhave a fetus with prenatal ultrasound findings consistent with\ncongenital Zika virus syndrome should receive Zika virus testing to\nassist in establishing the etiology of the birth defects. Testing\nshould include both NAT and IgM tests.\n6- The comprehensive approach to testing placental and fetal tissues\nhas been updated. Testing placental and fetal tissue specimens can be\nperformed for diagnostic purposes in certain scenarios (e.g., women\nwithout a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection and\nwho have a fetus or infant with possible Zika virus-associated birth\ndefects). However, testing of placental tissues for Zika virus\ninfection is not routinely recommended for asymptomatic pregnant women\nwho have recent possible Zika virus exposure but without ongoing\npossible exposure and who have a live born infant without evidence of\npossible Zika virus-associated birth defects.\n7- Zika virus IgM testing as part of preconception counseling to\nestablish baseline IgM results for non pregnant women with ongoing\npossible Zika virus exposure is not warranted because Zika virus IgM\ntesting is no longer routinely recommended for asymptomatic pregnant\nwomen with ongoing possible Zika virus exposure. also at the source URL above:\nAdditional interim guidance:\n- Laboratory testing of pregnant women with exposure to areas with\nrisk for Zika virus transmission\n- Prenatal management of pregnant women with laboratory evidence of\npossible Zika virus infection\n- Evaluation of placental and fetal tissue specimens for Zika virus\ninfection \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org)\nand\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be)(promed@promedmail.org) Readers interested in accessing the full report can find it at the\nsource URL above.

To evaluate the rates of acute ZIKV infection among\npatients hospitalized with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS),\nmeningoencephalitis, or transverse myelitis.\nDesign, setting, and participants. A prospective, observational cohort\nstudy was conducted at a tertiary referral center for neurological\ndiseases in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between 5 Dec 2015-10 May 2016,\namong consecutive hospitalized adults (older than 18 years of age)\nwith new-onset acute parainfectious or neuroinflammatory disease. All\nparticipants were tested for a series of arbovirosis. 3-month\nfunctional outcome was assessed.\nInterventions. Samples of serum and cerebrospinal fluid were tested\nfor ZIKV using real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain\nreaction and an IgM antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent\nassay. Clinical, radiographic (magnetic resonance imaging),\nelectrophysiological, and 3-month functional outcome data were\ncollected.\nMain outcomes and measures. The detection of neurologic complications\nsecondary to ZIKV infection.\nResults. 40 patients (15 women and 25 men; median age, 44 years\nrange, 22-72 years) were enrolled, including 29 patients (73\npercent) with GBS (90 percent Brighton level 1 certainty), 7 (18\npercent) with encephalitis, 3 (8 percent) with transverse myelitis,\nand 1 (3 percent) with newly diagnosed chronic inflammatory\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy. Of these, 35 patients (88 percent) had\nmolecular and/or serologic evidence of recent ZIKV infection in the\nserum and/or cerebrospinal fluid. Of the patients positive for ZIKV\ninfection, 27 had GBS (18 demyelinating, 8 axonal, and 1 Miller Fisher\nsyndrome), 5 had encephalitis (3 with concomitant acute neuromuscular\ndisease), 2 had transverse myelitis, and 1 had chronic inflammatory\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy. Admission to the intensive care unit was\nrequired for 9 patients positive for ZIKV infection (26 percent), and\n5 (14 percent) required mechanical ventilation. Compared with\nadmission during the period from 5 Dec 2013 - 10 May 2014 (before the\nBrazilian outbreak of ZIKV), admissions for GBS increased from a mean\nof 1.0 per month to 5.6 per month, admissions for encephalitis\nincreased from 0.4 per month to 1.4 per month, and admissions for\ntransverse myelitis remained constant at 0.6 per month. At 3 months, 2\npatients positive for ZIKV infection (6 percent) died (1 with GBS and\n1 with encephalitis), 18 (51 percent) had chronic pain, and the median\nmodified Rankin score among survivors was 2 (range, 0-5).\nConclusions and relevance. In this single-center Brazilian cohort,\nZIKV infection was associated with an increase in the incidence of a\ndiverse spectrum of serious neurologic syndromes. The data also\nsuggest that serologic and molecular testing using blood and\ncerebrospinal fluid samples can serve as a less expensive, alternative\ndiagnostic strategy in developing countries, where plaque reduction\nneutralization testing is impractical. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) This study illustrates the need to consider post-Zika virus infection\nas a cause of a variety of neurological diseases.

PLoS\nPathog. 2017; 13(8): e1006487. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006487\n-\nAbstract\n\nStudies have demonstrated cross-reactivity of anti-dengue virus (DENV)\nantibodies in human sera against Zika virus (ZIKV), promoting\nincreased ZIKV infection in vitro. However, the correlation between in\nvitro and in vivo findings is not well characterized. Thus, we\nevaluated the impact of heterotypic flavivirus immunity on ZIKV titers\nin biofluids of rhesus macaques. Animals previously infected (420 days\nor longer) with DENV2, DENV4, or yellow fever virus were compared to\nflavivirus-naïve animals following infection with a Brazilian ZIKV\nstrain. Sera from DENV-immune macaques demonstrated cross-reactivity\nwith ZIKV by antibody-binding and neutralization assays prior to ZIKV\ninfection, and promoted increased ZIKV infection in cell culture\nassays. Despite these findings, no significant differences between\nflavivirus-naïve and immune animals were observed in viral titers,\nneutralizing antibody levels, or immune cell kinetics following ZIKV\ninfection. These results indicate that prior infection with\nheterologous flaviviruses neither conferred protection nor increased\nobserved ZIKV titers in this non-human primate ZIKV infection model. Author summary\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne, emerging flavivirus. In\naddition to asymptomatic or mild febrile manifestations, ZIKV\ninfection in humans is associated with comparatively rare congenital\nand neurological abnormalities. Previous in vitro studies have\ndemonstrated cross-reactivity of antibodies derived from dengue virus\ninfections with ZIKV, as well as antibody-mediated enhancement of\ninfection in cell culture. Therefore, there is concern among\nvaccinologists and the public health community that the more severe\ndisease manifestations could result from prior immunity, either from\nnatural infection or vaccination, to antigenically-related\nflaviviruses (such as, dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis).\nIn this study, we evaluated the impact of prior immunity to dengue or\nyellow fever virus on ZIKV infection in a non-human primate model.\nAfter confirming that our immune cohorts were capable of\nrecapitulating the published in vitro observations of cross-reactivity\nand enhancement, we looked for alteration of viral titers in\nperipheral blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, and vaginal\nsecretions, as well as alterations in gross pathology, clinical\nparameters, and immune response, as compared to our flavivirus-naïve\ncohort. Importantly, no significant differences between\nflavivirus-naïve and primed animals were observed in viral titers or\nbiofluid distribution, neutralizing antibody levels, or immune cell\nkinetics following ZIKV infection. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org)\nand\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be)(promed@promedmail.org) Previous dengue infection, whether acquired naturally or antibody\nelicited by vaccines, has been a concern due to the possibility of\nantibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) with more severe disease. This\nconcern also relates to Zika virus antibody from vaccination for\nenhancement of dengue virus infections with resulting more severe\ndisease. The monkey studies reported above indicated that this may not\nbe a problem for Zika virus vaccinated individuals.

ZIKV is also transmitted by\nsexual contact, although the relative importance of sexual\ntransmission is unclear. To better understand the role of sexual\ntransmission in ZIKV pathogenesis, a nonhuman primate (NHP) model of\nvaginal transmission was developed. ZIKV was readily transmitted to\nmature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by vaginal inoculation was\nreadily transmitted to mature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by\nvaginal individual RM with 1-5 vaginal inoculations required to\nestablish infection. After treatment with Depoprovera, a widely used\ncontraceptive progestin, 2 RM that initially resisted 8 vaginal ZIKV\ninoculations became infected after one ZIKV inoculation. Thus,\nDepoprovera seemed to enhance susceptibility to vaginal ZIKV\ntransmission. Unexpectedly, the kinetics of virus replication and\ndissemination after intravaginal ZIKV inoculation were markedly\ndifferent from RM infected with ZIKV by subcutaneous (SQ) virus\ninoculation. Several groups have reported that after SQ ZIKV\ninoculation vRNA is rapidly detected in blood plasma with vRNA less\ncommon in urine and saliva and only rarely detected in female\nreproductive tract (FRT) secretions. In contrast, in vaginally\ninoculated RM, plasma vRNA is delayed for several days and ZIKV\nreplication in, and vRNA shedding from, the FRT was found in all 6\nanimals. Further, after intravaginal transmission ZIKV RNA shedding\nfrom FRT secretions was detected before or simultaneously with plasma\nvRNA, and persisted for at least as long. Thus, ZIKV replication in\nthe FRT was independent of, and often preceded virus replication in\nthe tissues contributing to plasma vRNA. These results support the\nconclusion that ZIKV preferentially replicates in the FRT after\nvaginal transmission, but not after SQ transmission, and raise the\npossibility that there is enhanced fetal infection and pathology after\nvaginal ZIKV transmission compared to a mosquito transmitted ZIKV. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{10}</strong> _Aedes albopictus_ populations as vectors.\nDate: 2 Aug 2017.\nSource: American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (edited)\n(http://www.ajtmh.org/content/journals/10.4269/ajtmh.16-0969) \nref: Azar SR, Roundy CM, Rossi SL, et al.

Positive saliva samples were assayed for\ninfectious titer. Although all 3 mosquito populations were susceptible\nto all ZIKV strains, rates of infection, dissemination, and\ntransmission differed among mosquito and virus strains. _Aedes\nalbopictus_ from Salvador, Brazil, were the least efficient vectors,\ndemonstrating susceptibility to infection to 2 American strains of\nZIKV but failing to shed virus in saliva. Mosquitoes from the Rio\nGrande Valley were the most efficient vectors and were capable of\nshedding all 3 tested ZIKV strains into saliva after 14 days of\nextrinsic incubation. In particular, ZIKV strain DakAR 41525 (Senegal\n1954) was significantly more efficient at dissemination and saliva\ndeposition than the others tested in Rio Grande mosquitoes. Overall,\nour data indicate that, while _Ae. albopictus_ is capable of\ntransmitting ZIKV, its competence is potentially dependent on\ngeographic origin of both the mosquito population and the viral\nstrain. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) This study illustrates that fact that not all Zika virus strains and\n_Ae. albopictus_ populations are created equal in terms of efficiency\nof transmission of this virus.

Emerg Microbes\nInfect. 2017; 6(8): e69. doi: 10.1038/emi.2017.59\n-\nAbstract\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has recently been associated\nwith an increased incidence of neonatal microcephaly and other\nneurological disorders. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito\nbite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some\ncases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main\nvector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other\nmosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the\nvirus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit\nZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of\nlaboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_.\nInterestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the\nmidgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in\nRecife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially\nfed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced.\nCollectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range\nof ZIKV vectors than anticipated. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be) Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active\nvirus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their\nability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step\ntoward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_\nfed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in\nsaliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing.\nThe study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a\ncompetent vector. Several other studies have shown this species to be\ninefficient vectors or refractory to Zika virus infection. One wonders\nif the specific _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ used or the Zika virus isolates\nwith which they were tested could account for these very different\nresults. Resolving these discrepancies is important because this\nmosquito species is very widely distributed around the world and bears\ndirectly on risk of outbreaks in geographic areas where _Aedes\naegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_ , Zika virus vectors, do not occur. -\nMod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"122":{"title":"Ciguatera fish poisoning - Belize: barracuda,\r\n\talert ","date":["26","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH/EDR> Ciguatera fish poisoning - Belize: barracuda,\r\n\talert [EXTERNAL]","summary":"\nCIGUATERA FISH POISONING - BELIZE: BARRACUDA, ALERT\n*\nA ProMED-mail post\n(http://www.promedmail.org)\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n(http://www.isid.org).

Ciguatera poisoning, which causes\nsymptoms such as tingling and numbness in fingers and toes, around\nlips, tongue, mouth and throat; nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and/or\nabdominal cramps; joint pains and headache; and breathing difficulty,\nhas also been reported in Belize, and over the past 4 days, 2 alerts\nhave been issued by the Ministry of Health in Belize, following\nreports of cases cropping up, which have been linked to the\nconsumption of barracuda fish. In the 1st alert, issued on Fri 18 Aug 2017, the Ministry of Health\nreported that \"suspected fish poisoning (Ciguatera poisoning) was\ndetected in people that had eaten fish bought from a fish vendor in\nLadyville, Belize District.\" In the 2nd alert, issued on Tue 23 Aug\n2017, the Ministry said that 2 further cases of suspected Ciguatera\npoisoning, linked to the consumption of the large predatory fish, had\nbeen identified. \"Investigations conducted so far reveal that the\nbarracuda fish from the Turneffe Islands area has been the sole\ncarrier of the ciguaxtoin or poison,\" the alert said. It warned that\ntoxic fish does not have any odor or taste and cooking and freezing\ndoes not eliminate the toxin. According to the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),\nciguatera fish poisoning (or ciguatera) is an illness caused by eating\nfish that contain toxins produced by a marine microalgae called\n_Gambierdiscus toxicus_, associated with corals. Whereas the barracuda\nis believed to be the culprit for the most recent bouts of illness\ncaused by the toxin, other fish may also carry the toxin, including\ncoral trout, red snapper, donu, parrot fish, grouper, Spanish\nmackerel, red emperor, wrasse, reef cod, sturgeon fish, trevally and\nmoray eel. The CDC also lists blackfin snapper, cubera snapper, dog\nsnapper, greater amberjack, hogfish, horse-eye jack, and king mackerel\namong the fish which have been known to carry ciguatoxins. \"Anyone who consumes fish contaminated with the ciguatera toxin will\nbecome ill,\" the Ministry's alert said, adding that, \"The\ngastrointestinal or stomach symptoms normally appear within 24 hours\nof exposure and those of the nervous system can appear 1 to 2 days\nlater.\" Although some symptoms may last only a few days, in some\ncases, the toxin can continue to affect those who ingest it for\nmonths. The CDC says people who have ciguatera may find that cold\nthings feel hot and hot things feel cold. The Belize Ministry of Health has shared some guidelines for reducing\nthe risk of CFP. It advises the following:\n- Avoid eating larger reef fish that have a greater likelihood of\ncarrying ciguatoxins, especially the barracuda. - Limit the weight of a fish to less than 11 pounds, as ciguatera fish\npoisoning occurs more frequently in larger fish. - Eat other types of fish not listed above.\n- Avoid eating the head, roe or fish egg, liver, or other organs of\nthe fish, as it is where the highest level of toxin is present.

Ending the outbreak and preventing its spread beyond Tanzania's\nborders is a high priority for WHO. To that end, WHO and partners\nsupport a well-coordinated multisectoral response through the National\nCholera Task Force which plans, coordinates and support subnational\nauthorities. Indeed, learning requires a continuous assessment of performance, a\nreview of successes and failures and a robust support for improvement.\nAn After Action Review (AAR) is a simple methodology for facilitating\nthis assessment. It provides for a qualitative review of actions taken\nto respond to an emergency as a means of identifying best practices,\ngaps and lessons learned. As a component of the IHR Monitoring and\nEvaluation Framework (IHR MEF) and part of the preparedness and\nresponse cycle, an AAR seeks to identify what worked well or not and\nhow these practices can be maintained, improved, institutionalized and\nshared with relevant stakeholders.

The 1st 2 cases of\ncholera were tested positive by National Institute of Health Islamabad\non Mon 31 Jul 2017 and another 2 confirmed positive for the\ninfection on Fri 4 Aug 2017. All the 4 patients were undergoing\ntreatment at Benazir Bhutto Hospital BH where as many as 4 more\nsuspects of the infection have been admitted for treatment. Data collected by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017 reveals that the\nallied hospitals have sent stool samples of over 10 child patients to\nNIH for confirmation of cholera in last week week of Sun 6 Aug\n2017. On Sat 12 Aug 2017, as many as 20 child patients with severe\ndiarrhoea were admitted at the BBH of which 4 were suspected as\npatients of cholera and their stool samples were sent to NIH for\nconfirmation, said Associate Professor of Paediatrics at Rawalpindi\nMedical University Dr Tariq Saeed when contacted by 'The News' on Mon\n14 Aug 2017. He added the hospital has not received confirmation reports from the\nNIH because of holidays there from Saturday to Monday. However, we\nhave been keeping the suspects in isolation under strict monitoring,\nhe said. He added that repeated rainfalls in the region and water inundation\ninside and outside homes in a number of localities particularly in\nthickly populated areas of the city are causing contamination of water\nand foodstuff that increases chances of spread of a number of\ninfections among population while children are at greater risk of\ncontracting life-threatening infections including cholera. It is important that the transmission of cholera occurs primarily by\ndrinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the feces\n(waste product) of an infected person, including one with no apparent\nsymptoms. It is observed that heavy rainfall causes collection of heavily\ncontaminated water in streets and houses and the waste water flooding\nout of various nullahs watercourses including Nullah Leh in town\ncauses infections including cholera, typhoid, dysentery,\ngastroenteritis, hepatitis A and E, shigellosis and giardiasis. Professor Tariq said the consumption of contaminated water and\nfoodstuff causes cholera, an infection in the small intestine caused\nby bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. Its main symptoms are watery diarrhea\nand vomiting that can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte\nimbalance, and death in cases which are not treated in time, he said. Health experts say that to avoid cholera and other infections, one\nmust use boiled water for drinking and should use vegetables after\nwashing with clean water and it must be kept in mind that raw\nvegetables should not be eaten in the existing weather conditions\ninstead these should be used after cooking. To a query, Professor Tariq said the heavy rainfall and water\naccumulation may contaminate water at sources and there may be chances\nof contamination of water at tube wells so individuals must boil water\nbefore drinking to avoid cholera and other infections. He added the appearance of cholera is alarming and it is time for\npeople to take extra ordinary preventive measures to safeguard their\nchildren and themselves from the disease. In case water is accumulated inside home due to heavy rainfall and\nflooded out of sewage lines, it must be wiped out immediately and the\nspace should be washed with clean water as soon as possible to avoid\ninfections. Avoiding inundation of contaminated water inside homes is\na must to avoid cholera and other infections, said Professor Tariq.

In the Caribbean and Central American countries, respiratory illness indicators and influenza activity remained low in general, but respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) activity was increasing.  In Southern Asia, increased influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus detections were reported in India. Severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and influenza like illness (ILI) indicators remained high in Bhutan.  In South East Asia, increased influenza activity was reported in recent weeks, with all seasonal influenza subtypes present in the region.  In East and Western Asia, influenza activity remained low in general.  In Western Africa, influenza activity continued to be reported, with all seasonal influenza subtypes present in the region. Few influenza detections were reported in Eastern Africa.  In Northern Africa, no influenza virus detections were reported.  In Central Asia, there were no updated reports on virus detections or respiratory illness indicators.  In Europe and North America, little to no influenza activity was reported.  National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 64 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the period from 7-20 Aug 2017 (data as of 2017-09-01 04:28:36 UTC). The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 48522 specimens during that period. 7438 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 6637 (89.2 percent) were typed as influenza A and 801 (10.8 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 746 (14 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and 4586 (86 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 99 (53.8 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 85 (46.2 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail.

The recent outbreaks of ZIKV in Brazil and French\nPolynesia have been linked to a considerable increase in the incidence\nof fetal microcephaly and other diseases such as Guillain-Barre\nsyndrome. Because there is currently no specific therapy or vaccine,\nthe early exploitation of a method to prevent expansion of ZIKV is a\nhigh priority. To validate commonly used antiviral drugs, we evaluated\nthe effect of ribavirin, a drug used to treat hepatitis C with\ninterferon-beta (IFN-beta), on ZIKV replication. In mammalian cells,\nwe observed an inhibitory effect of ribavirin on ZIKV replication and\nZIKV-induced cell death without cytotoxic effect. Furthermore, we\nfound that STAT1-deficient mice, which lack type I IFN signaling, were\nhighly sensitive to ZIKV infection and exhibited lethal outcome.\nRibavirin abrogated viremia in ZIKV-infected STAT-1-deficient mice.\nThese data suggest that the inhibition of viral RNA-dependent RNA\npolymerases may be effective for treatment of ZIKV infection. Our data\nprovide a new insight into the mechanisms for inhibition of ZIKV\nreplication and prevention of Zika fever. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) It will be interesting to see if these encouraging results showing\ninhibition of Zika virus replication can be replicated in non-human\nprimates. The challenge for use of drugs to inhibit Zika virus\ninfection in humans is that most (around 80 percent) Zika virus\ninfections are asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms. These\nindividuals will probably not seek medical treatment, even though\ntheir fetuses are at risk of infection with teratogenic effects. -\nMod.TY \n<br><br><strong>{3}</strong> Zika virus skewed immunosuppression.\nDate: Mon 21 Aug 2017.\nSource: Nature Microbiology journal (edited)\n(http://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-017-0016-3) \nref: Foo SS, Chen W, Chan Y, et al. Asian Zika virus strains target\nCD14+ blood monocytes and induce M2-skewed immunosuppression during\npregnancy. Nat Microbiol. 2017. doi: 10.1038/s41564-017-0016-3\n-\nAbstract\nBlood CD14+ monocytes are frontline immunomodulators categorized into\nclassical, intermediate or non-classical subsets, and subsequently\ndifferentiated into M1 pro- or M2 anti-inflammatory macrophages on\nstimulation. Although the Zika virus (ZIKV) rapidly establishes\nviraemia, the target cells and immune responses, particularly during\npregnancy, remain elusive. Furthermore, it is unknown whether African-\nand Asian-lineage ZIKV have different phenotypic impacts on host\nimmune responses. Using human blood infection, we identified CD14+\nmonocytes as the primary target for African- or Asian-lineage ZIKV\ninfection. When immunoprofiles of human blood infected with ZIKV were\ncompared, a classical/intermediate monocyte-mediated M1-skewed\ninflammation by the African-lineage ZIKV infection was observed, in\ncontrast to a non-classical monocyte-mediated M2-skewed\nimmunosuppression by the Asian-lineage ZIKV infection. Importantly,\ninfection of the blood of pregnant women revealed an enhanced\nsusceptibility to ZIKV infection. Specifically, Asian-lineage ZIKV\ninfection of pregnant women's blood led to an exacerbated M2-skewed\nimmunosuppression of non-classical monocytes in conjunction with a\nglobal suppression of type I interferon-signaling pathway and an\naberrant expression of host genes associated with pregnancy\ncomplications. Also, 30 ZIKV+ sera from symptomatic pregnant patients\nshowed elevated levels of M2-skewed immunosuppressive cytokines and\npregnancy-complication-associated fibronectin-1. This study\ndemonstrates the differential immunomodulatory responses of blood\nmonocytes, particularly during pregnancy, on infection with different\nlineages of ZIKV. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{4}</strong> Virus alters mosquito genes.\nDate: Tue 22 Aug 2017.\nSource: bioRxiv journal (edited)\n(http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/22/179416) \nref: Etebari K, Hegde S, Saldana MA, et al. Global transcriptome\nanalysis of _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes in response to Zika virus\ninfection. bioRxiv 179416; doi:10.1101/179416\n-\nZika virus (ZIKV) of the Flaviviridae family is a recently emerged\nmosquito-borne virus that has been implicated in the surge of the\nnumber of microcephaly instances in South America. The recent rapid\nspread of the virus led to its declaration as a global health\nemergency by the World Health Organization. The virus is transmitted\nmainly by the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_ that also vectors dengue virus,\nhowever little is known about the interactions of the virus with the\nmosquito vector. In this study, we investigated the transcriptome\nprofiles of whole _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes in response to ZIKV\ninfection at 2, 7, and 14 days post-infection using RNA-Seq. Results\nshowed changes in the abundance of a large number of transcripts at\neach time point following infection, with 18 transcripts commonly\nchanged among the 3 time points. Gene ontology analysis revealed that\nmost of the altered genes are involved in metabolic process, cellular\nprocess and proteolysis. In addition, 486 long intergenic non-coding\nRNAs were identified altered upon ZIKV infection. Further, we found\ncorrelational changes of a number of potential mRNA target genes with\nthat of altered host microRNAs. The outcomes provide a basic\nunderstanding of _Ae. aegypti_ responses to ZIKV and helps to\ndetermine host factors involved in replication or mosquito host\nanti-viral response against the virus. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) Mosquito vector competence depends on the relationship of virus and\nthe mosquito, and the defenses that the mosquito can mobilize against\nthe virus infection. Studies, such as the one above, can document the\nchanges that occur when the virus infects the mosquito, and if\ndifferences in relative vector efficiency of different geographic\nstrains of this mosquito might be related to alternations in mosquito\ngenes when infected. It would be interesting to know if these gene\nchanges affect fitness, and especially longevity of infected\nmosquitoes. - Mod.TY \n<br><br><strong>{5}</strong> Virus effects on sperm, body fluids.\nDate: Mon 21 Aug 2017.\nSource: The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal (edited)\n(http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(17)30444-9/abstract) \nref: Joguet G, Mansuy JM, Matusali G, et al.

To investigate the effects of Zika\nvirus infection on semen and clearance of Zika virus from semen and\nbody fluids, we aimed to study a cohort of Zika virus-infected men. Methods\nThis prospective observational study recruited men presenting with\nacute Zika virus infection at Pointe-Ã -Pitre University Hospital in\nGuadeloupe, French Caribbean, where a Zika virus outbreak occurred\nbetween April and November, 2016. Blood, urine, and semen were\ncollected at days 7, 11, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 after symptom onset,\nand semen characteristics, such as total sperm count, sperm motility,\nvitality, and morphology, and reproductive hormone concentrations,\nsuch as testosterone, inhibin, follicle-stimulating hormone, and\nluteinising hormone, were assessed. At days 7, 11, and 20, semen was\nprocessed to isolate motile spermatozoa. Zika virus RNA was detected\nby RT-PCR using whole blood, serum, urine, seminal plasma, semen\ncells, and motile spermatozoa fractions. Zika virus was isolated from\ndifferent sperm fractions on Vero E6 cultures. Findings\n15 male volunteers (mean age 35 years SD 5; range 25-44) with acute\nZika virus infection and positive Zika virus RNA detection in blood or\nurine were enrolled. Total sperm count was decreased from median\n119âÃâ10^6 spermatozoa (IQR interquartile range 22-234)\nat day 7, to 45.2âÃâ10^6 (16.5-89.6) at day 30, and 70\nÃ 10^6 (28.5-81.4) at day 60, respectively, after Zika virus\ninfection. Inhibin values increased from 93.5 pg/mL (IQR 55-162) at\nday 7 to 150 pg/mL (78-209) at day 120 when total sperm count\nrecovered. In motile spermatozoa obtained after density gradient\nseparation, Zika virus RNA was found in 3 of 14 patients at day 7, 4\nof 15 at day 11, and 4 of 15 at day 20, and replication-competent\nvirus was found in the tested patient. Seminal shedding kinetics\nseemed heterogeneous among patients. Whole blood was the fluid most\nfrequently positive for Zika virus RNA (62 of 92 samples) and 3\npatients remained positive at day 120. Interpretation\nSemen alterations early after acute Zika virus infection might affect\nfertility and could be explained by virus effects on the testis and\nepididymis. Frequency of shedding and high viral load in semen,\ntogether with the presence of replicative virus in a motile\nspermatozoa fraction, can lead to Zika virus transmission during\nsexual contact and assisted reproduction procedures. Whole blood seems\nto be the best specimen for Zika virus RNA detection, diagnosis, and\nfollow-up. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall In a new study that included 12 men in French Guiana who had Zika\nvirus, 4 never had any detectable Zika in their semen, 1 excreted Zika\nvirus in his semen for at least 3 days, and 7 had Zika virus in semen\nfor at least 1 month.

Vaccines protect fetus from Zika. JAMA. 2017; 318(8):\n689. doi:10.1001/jama.2017.11200\n-\nResearchers funded in part by the National Institutes of Health have\nrecently demonstrated that 2 experimental vaccines can restrict\ntransmission of Zika virus from pregnant mice to their fetuses,\nthereby shielding offspring from congenital damage or death. Multiple candidate Zika vaccines have been shown protective against\ninfection with the virus in animal studies, with several now in human\ntrials, but none were tested in the context of pregnancy, according to\nthe authors of the study published in Cell\n(http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(17)30759-6). The 2\nvaccine candidates investigated in the new study are the 1st to\ndemonstrate efficacy in preventing vertical transmission of the virus\nand related fetal death in an animal model. Although the vaccines were\nadministered to female mice prior to pregnancy, the result is\nconsidered an important step toward developing a vaccine that could be\nsafely given to pregnant women. One of the 2 candidates is a modified messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine\nencoding Zika genes, developed by the biotechnology company Moderna.\nIt is already in safety trials in women who are not pregnant. The\nother is a live-attenuated Zika strain developed by researchers at the\nUniversity of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). The testing was carried out by scientists from the National Institute\nof Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Washington University School of\nMedicine, and UTMB. The researchers 1st vaccinated the mice with 1 of\nthe vaccines or a placebo. After mating, the animals were challenged\nwith the virus 6 days into pregnancy. A week later, more than 50\npercent of placentas and fetuses from mice administered the mRNA\nvaccine had virtually no Zika RNA. The remainder had \"substantially\nlower\" levels relative to placebo.\nThe live vaccine provided broader protection: 78 percent of placentas\nand 83 percent of fetuses had Zika RNA at or below the level of\ndetection, while the placebo group exhibited significantly higher\nlevels of placental and fetal Zika RNA. Mice vaccinated with either\nvaccine had significantly higher rates of fetal viability; whereas 100\npercent of fetuses from mice vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine were\nborn, none survived to term in the placebo group. A working group funded by the Wellcome Trust recently approved ethical\nguidelines for testing such vaccines in pregnant women, normally\nexcluded from drug trials. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) It is reassuring to learn that at least 2 vaccines are now entering\nclinical trials in women.

Date: Thu 17 Aug 2017. Source: The Horse (edited) (http://www.thehorse.com/articles/39562/dressage-horse-detained-after-positive-glanders-test)   An American dressage horse returning to the United States after a competition tour in Europe has tested positive for Glanders. Shipped from Amsterdam to Miami after participating in Sweden and UK  An American dressage horse returning to the United States after a competition tour in Europe could be euthanized or shipped back out of the country after testing positive for glanders during routine USDA equine import quarantine.  Glanders is a highly contagious upper respiratory disease that can be passed from horse-to-horse as well as to human handlers. Acute clinical signs include fever; cough; difficulty breathing; nasal discharge; swollen and painful submaxillary lymph nodes (the \"glands\" in \"glanders\"); rapidly spreading ulcers on the nasal mucosa, nodules, and chronic abscesses; and small abscesses in the lung and/or abscesses in the liver or spleen, among others. Clinical signs of chronic glanders include coughing; malaise; weight loss; intermittent fever; possible thick nasal discharge, usually out of one nostril; ulcers and nodules on the nasal mucosa; enlarged submaxillary lymph nodes; chronic enlargement and induration (hardening) of lymphatics and lymph nodes; joint swelling and painful leg edema (fluid swelling); and nodules, particularly on the legs, that rupture, release pus, and ulcerate. Glanders has been eradicated from North American and was last reported in the United States in the 1940s. It's recently been reported in several areas around the world, however, including South America, Eastern Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and a rare case in Germany in 2014.  Earlier this month August 2017, the 18-year-old Dutch Warmblood gelding Sagacious HF was shipped from Amsterdam to the Miami International Airport after participating in competitions in Sweden and England with Chase Hickok. Under USDA rules, all horses entering the United States, except those coming from Canada, must be quarantined and tested for 4 diseases  dourine, glanders, equine piroplasmosis, and equine infectious anemia  upon arrival.  Jeanine Neskey, interim public affairs specialist for the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), said an animal that produces a positive test result is denied entry to the United States.  \"Denied entry means that it must be either removed from the U.S. or be euthanized,\" she said. \"If the horse is denied entry into the U.S. (and not euthanized), the owner is free to take the horse to any other country that will accept it.\"  Scott Leibsle, DVM, Idaho's deputy state veterinarian, said Sagacious could have contracted the disease through contaminated feed or through water buckets also used by other horses participating in competitions. The gelding might also have been an asymptomatic carrier of the disease, possibly developing signs after experiencing stress  \"Transport is the most stressful thing you can do to a horse,\" he said. \"At the same time, you're putting it with new animals in a new area, and putting it under the stress of competition.\"  Currently APHIS uses a complement fixation test (CFT) to detect glanders. However, the agency is evaluating other testing methods, including the Western Blot procedure.  \"Advancing research and improved technology continue to develop new or improved testing methods for animal diseases,\" Neskey said. \"USDA routinely evaluates all testing methods available and incorporates the methods most appropriate to the needs of import quarantine testing.\"  After Sagacious produced a 2nd positive CFT glanders test, he produced a negative Western Blot glanders test. Arrangements were made to place him on extended quarantine pending the results of additional testing with both tests, slated for Wed 23 Aug 2017.  Byline: Pat Raia   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  Glanders, also known as farcy, is a contagious infectious disease of equines, acute or chronic, usually fatal, caused by the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_, and characterized by the development of ulcerated nodules that are most commonly found in the upper airway, lungs ,and skin. Felines and other animals are susceptible to infection, which is usually fatal. Humans can be infected and the microorganism (_B. mallei_) is considered a potential bioterrorism agent.  The disease, one among the oldest known and that used to be prevalent worldwide, is currently eradicated or effectively controlled in many countries. Recently the disease has been reported in some countries, including Iraq, Turkey, Pakistan, India, Mongolia, China, Brazil, United Arab Emirates, and countries in Africa. Glanders is one of the diseases contained in the list of diseases for mandatory reporting to the World Animal Health Organization (OIE).  The bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_ a clonal pathogen, can be found in nasal secretions and skin ulcers of infected animals. The transmission of glanders occurs commonly from intake of water or food contaminated with nasal secretions and exudates eliminated from infected animals, contact with contaminated equipment (saddles, harness) and by eating contaminated equine meat.  In the nasal form, nodules arise in septum and turbinates. Nodules progress to irregular edged ulcers; star-shaped scars are characteristic after the resolution of the ulcers. In the early stage, submandibular lymph nodes are enlarged and edematous, adhering to the skin and deep tissues in advanced stages of the disease. In the pulmonary form, inflammatory nodules with caseous or calcified centers are found in the lungs. With the progression of the disease areas of consolidation and pneumonia may be present. The nodules may break and eliminate the inflammatory content into the bronchial tree, spreading the infection to the upper respiratory tract. In the cutaneous form, nodules arise along the lymphatic vessels, especially on the extremities. The nodules may degenerate to form ulcers with drainage of highly infectious purulent material. The liver and spleen may have typical nodular lesions. Histologically, vasculitis, thrombosis, inflammatory cell infiltration and degeneration can be seen.  A test based on complement fixation can also be used for screening, but the ELISA test, although more sensitive, is not being routinely used. PCR can be used for specific identification ((https://www.merckvetmanual.com/generalized-conditions/glanders/overview-of-glanders)).  There are no vaccines. Prevention and control depend on early detection and eliminating infected animals in addition to quarantine and complete disinfection. Treatment, administered only in endemic areas, which does not lead to microbiological cure, is the use of doxycycline, ceftazidime, gentamycin, or streptomycin. Sulfa drugs (including in combination with trimethoprim) seem to be effective in prevention and glanders treatment ((http://www.merckmanuals.com/vet/generalized_conditions/glanders/overview_of_glanders.html?qt=glanders&alt=sh#Diagnosis)).  For glanders-free countries, there are OIE recommendations on importing equines. An international veterinary certificate is required attesting that the animals showed no clinical signs of glanders and were kept in an exporting country free of the disease for at least 6 months prior to shipment ((http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/GLA-EN.pdf)). It appears foreign horse owners will not be able to comply, therefore will be unable to repatriate their show horses? Further information would be welcome.  OIE WAHID's latest information shows continuing glanders in Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais states in 2014 (red circles on map; zoom in), but there have been no immediate or continuing event reports for Brazil in 2015. The OIE report and map are available at (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=11974).  As a horse owner, this would be devastating. We certainly hope Sagacious test later this month August 2017 clears him of this disease. - Mod.TG  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/212).

Here we evaluate the risk of Zika virus transmission through\nmucosal contact in rhesus macaques. Application of high-dose Zika\nvirus directly to the tonsils of 3 rhesus macaques results in\ndetectable plasma viremia in all animals by 2 days post-exposure;\nvirus replication kinetics are similar to those observed in animals\ninfected subcutaneously. 3 additional macaques inoculated\nsubcutaneously with Zika virus served as saliva donors to assess the\ntransmission risk from contact with oral secretions from an infected\nindividual. 7 naive animals repeatedly exposed to donor saliva via the\nconjunctivae, tonsils, or nostrils did not become infected.

Update: Interim guidance\nfor health care providers caring for pregnant women with possible Zika\nvirus exposure  United States (including US Territories), July 2017.\nMMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2017; 66(29): 781-93. doi:\n10.15585/mmwr.mm6629e1\n-\nCDC has updated the interim guidance for US health care providers\ncaring for pregnant women with possible Zika virus exposure in\nresponse to 1) declining prevalence of Zika virus disease in the World\nHealth Organization's Region of the Americas (Americas) and 2)\nemerging evidence indicating prolonged detection of Zika virus\nimmunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies. Zika virus cases were 1st reported\nin the Americas during 2015-2016; however, the incidence of Zika virus\ndisease has since declined. As the prevalence of Zika virus disease\ndeclines, the likelihood of false-positive test results increases. In\naddition, emerging epidemiologic and laboratory data indicate that, as\nis the case with other flaviviruses, Zika virus IgM antibodies can\npersist beyond 12 weeks after infection. Therefore, IgM test results\ncannot always reliably distinguish between an infection that occurred\nduring the current pregnancy and one that occurred before the current\npregnancy, particularly for women with possible Zika virus exposure\nbefore the current pregnancy. These limitations should be considered\nwhen counseling pregnant women about the risks and benefits of testing\nfor Zika virus infection during pregnancy. This updated guidance\nemphasizes a shared decision-making model for testing and screening\npregnant women, one in which patients and providers work together to\nmake decisions about testing and care plans based on patient\npreferences and values, clinical judgment, and a balanced assessment\nof risks and expected outcomes. For these recommendations, the definition of possible Zika virus\nexposure has not changed and includes travel to, or residence in an\narea with risk for mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission or sex with\na partner who has traveled to or resides in an area with risk for\nmosquito-borne Zika virus transmission. These areas can be found on\nthe CDC \"Zika Travel Information\" webpage. Key recommendations include the following:\n1- All pregnant women in the United States and US territories should\nbe asked about possible Zika virus exposure before and during the\ncurrent pregnancy, at every prenatal care visit. CDC recommends that\npregnant women not travel to any area with risk for Zika virus\ntransmission. It is also recommended that pregnant women with a sex\npartner who has traveled to or lives in an area with risk for Zika\nvirus transmission use condoms or abstain from sex for the duration of\nthe pregnancy.\n2- Pregnant women with recent possible Zika virus exposure and\nsymptoms of Zika virus disease should be tested to diagnose the cause\nof their symptoms. The updated recommendations include concurrent Zika\nvirus nucleic acid test (NAT) and serologic testing as soon as\npossible through 12 weeks after symptom onset.\n3- Asymptomatic pregnant women with ongoing possible Zika virus\nexposure should be offered Zika virus NAT testing 3 times during\npregnancy. IgM testing is no longer routinely recommended because IgM\ncan persist for months after infection; therefore, IgM results cannot\nreliably determine whether an infection occurred during the current\npregnancy. The optimal timing and frequency of testing of asymptomatic\npregnant women with NAT alone is unknown. For pregnant women who have\nreceived a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection (by\neither NAT or serology positive/equivocal Zika virus or dengue virus\nIgM and Zika virus plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) 10 and\nhigher and dengue virus PRNT less than 10 results) any time before or\nduring the current pregnancy, additional Zika virus testing is not\nrecommended. For pregnant women without a prior laboratory-confirmed\ndiagnosis of Zika virus, NAT testing should be offered at the\ninitiation of prenatal care, and if Zika virus RNA is not detected on\nclinical specimens, 2 additional tests should be offered during the\ncourse of the pregnancy coinciding with prenatal visits.\n4- Asymptomatic pregnant women who have recent possible Zika virus\nexposure (that is, through travel or sexual exposure) but without\nongoing possible exposure are not routinely recommended to have Zika\nvirus testing. Testing should be considered using a shared\npatient-provider decision-making model, one in which patients and\nproviders work together to make decisions about testing and care plans\nbased on patient preferences and values, clinical judgment, a balanced\nassessment of risks and expected outcomes, and the jurisdiction's\nrecommendations. Based on the epidemiology of Zika virus transmission\nand other epidemiologic considerations (such as, seasonality),\njurisdictions might recommend testing of asymptomatic pregnant women,\neither for clinical care or as part of Zika virus surveillance. With\nthe decline in the prevalence of Zika virus disease, the updated\nrecommendations for the evaluation and testing of pregnant women with\nrecent possible Zika virus exposure but without ongoing possible\nexposure are now the same for all areas with any risk for Zika virus\ntransmission.\n5- Pregnant women who have recent possible Zika virus exposure and who\nhave a fetus with prenatal ultrasound findings consistent with\ncongenital Zika virus syndrome should receive Zika virus testing to\nassist in establishing the etiology of the birth defects. Testing\nshould include both NAT and IgM tests.\n6- The comprehensive approach to testing placental and fetal tissues\nhas been updated. Testing placental and fetal tissue specimens can be\nperformed for diagnostic purposes in certain scenarios (e.g., women\nwithout a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection and\nwho have a fetus or infant with possible Zika virus-associated birth\ndefects). However, testing of placental tissues for Zika virus\ninfection is not routinely recommended for asymptomatic pregnant women\nwho have recent possible Zika virus exposure but without ongoing\npossible exposure and who have a live born infant without evidence of\npossible Zika virus-associated birth defects.\n7- Zika virus IgM testing as part of preconception counseling to\nestablish baseline IgM results for non pregnant women with ongoing\npossible Zika virus exposure is not warranted because Zika virus IgM\ntesting is no longer routinely recommended for asymptomatic pregnant\nwomen with ongoing possible Zika virus exposure. also at the source URL above:\nAdditional interim guidance:\n- Laboratory testing of pregnant women with exposure to areas with\nrisk for Zika virus transmission\n- Prenatal management of pregnant women with laboratory evidence of\npossible Zika virus infection\n- Evaluation of placental and fetal tissue specimens for Zika virus\ninfection \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org)\nand\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be)(promed@promedmail.org) Readers interested in accessing the full report can find it at the\nsource URL above.

This cohort study evaluated adult patients with new-onset\nparainfectious or neuroinflammatory disease for the presence of acute\nZika virus infection in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples\nusing molecular and serological testing. An increase in the incidence\nof Guillain-Barré syndrome and encephalitis was observed compared\nwith the period before the outbreak of the Zika virus.\nMeaning The Zika virus may be associated with a rapid increase in the\nincidence of life-threatening neurologic syndromes; serologic and\nmolecular testing using blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples can\nserve as an alternative diagnostic strategy. Abstract\n\nImportance. There are no prospective cohort studies assessing the\nincidence and spectrum of neurologic manifestations secondary to Zika\nvirus (ZIKV) infection in adults.\nObjective. To evaluate the rates of acute ZIKV infection among\npatients hospitalized with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS),\nmeningoencephalitis, or transverse myelitis.\nDesign, setting, and participants. A prospective, observational cohort\nstudy was conducted at a tertiary referral center for neurological\ndiseases in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between 5 Dec 2015-10 May 2016,\namong consecutive hospitalized adults (older than 18 years of age)\nwith new-onset acute parainfectious or neuroinflammatory disease. All\nparticipants were tested for a series of arbovirosis. 3-month\nfunctional outcome was assessed.\nInterventions. Samples of serum and cerebrospinal fluid were tested\nfor ZIKV using real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain\nreaction and an IgM antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent\nassay. Clinical, radiographic (magnetic resonance imaging),\nelectrophysiological, and 3-month functional outcome data were\ncollected.\nMain outcomes and measures. The detection of neurologic complications\nsecondary to ZIKV infection.\nResults. 40 patients (15 women and 25 men; median age, 44 years\nrange, 22-72 years) were enrolled, including 29 patients (73\npercent) with GBS (90 percent Brighton level 1 certainty), 7 (18\npercent) with encephalitis, 3 (8 percent) with transverse myelitis,\nand 1 (3 percent) with newly diagnosed chronic inflammatory\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy. Of these, 35 patients (88 percent) had\nmolecular and/or serologic evidence of recent ZIKV infection in the\nserum and/or cerebrospinal fluid. Of the patients positive for ZIKV\ninfection, 27 had GBS (18 demyelinating, 8 axonal, and 1 Miller Fisher\nsyndrome), 5 had encephalitis (3 with concomitant acute neuromuscular\ndisease), 2 had transverse myelitis, and 1 had chronic inflammatory\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy. Admission to the intensive care unit was\nrequired for 9 patients positive for ZIKV infection (26 percent), and\n5 (14 percent) required mechanical ventilation. Compared with\nadmission during the period from 5 Dec 2013 - 10 May 2014 (before the\nBrazilian outbreak of ZIKV), admissions for GBS increased from a mean\nof 1.0 per month to 5.6 per month, admissions for encephalitis\nincreased from 0.4 per month to 1.4 per month, and admissions for\ntransverse myelitis remained constant at 0.6 per month. At 3 months, 2\npatients positive for ZIKV infection (6 percent) died (1 with GBS and\n1 with encephalitis), 18 (51 percent) had chronic pain, and the median\nmodified Rankin score among survivors was 2 (range, 0-5).\nConclusions and relevance. In this single-center Brazilian cohort,\nZIKV infection was associated with an increase in the incidence of a\ndiverse spectrum of serious neurologic syndromes. The data also\nsuggest that serologic and molecular testing using blood and\ncerebrospinal fluid samples can serve as a less expensive, alternative\ndiagnostic strategy in developing countries, where plaque reduction\nneutralization testing is impractical. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) This study illustrates the need to consider post-Zika virus infection\nas a cause of a variety of neurological diseases.

We found that ZIKV\npersistently infects brain endothelial cells that normally protect\nneurons from viral exposure. hBMECs are not damaged by ZIKV infection\nand, analogous to persistent HCV infection, ZIKV constitutively\ninduces and evades antiviral ISG IFN-stimulated genes and IFN\ninterferon responses to continuously replicate in hBMECs. As a\nresult, hBMECs provide a protective niche for systemic ZIKV spread and\na viral reservoir localized in the normally protective blood-brain\nbarrier. Consistent with the spread of ZIKV into neuronal\ncompartments, ZIKV was released basolaterally from hBMECs. Our\nfindings define hBMEC responses that contribute to persistent ZIKV\ninfection and potential targets for clearing ZIKV infections from\nhBMECs. These results further suggest roles for additional\nZIKV-infected ECs to facilitate viral spread and persistence in the\nprotected placental, retinal, and testicular compartments. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{7}</strong> Prior flavivirus infection and Zika virus infection.\nDate: Thu 3 Aug 2017.\nSource: PLoS (Public Library of Science) Pathogens (edited)\n(http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006487) \nMcCracken MK, Gromowski GD, Friberg HL, et al.

Sera from DENV-immune macaques demonstrated cross-reactivity\nwith ZIKV by antibody-binding and neutralization assays prior to ZIKV\ninfection, and promoted increased ZIKV infection in cell culture\nassays. Despite these findings, no significant differences between\nflavivirus-naïve and immune animals were observed in viral titers,\nneutralizing antibody levels, or immune cell kinetics following ZIKV\ninfection. These results indicate that prior infection with\nheterologous flaviviruses neither conferred protection nor increased\nobserved ZIKV titers in this non-human primate ZIKV infection model. Author summary\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne, emerging flavivirus. In\naddition to asymptomatic or mild febrile manifestations, ZIKV\ninfection in humans is associated with comparatively rare congenital\nand neurological abnormalities. Previous in vitro studies have\ndemonstrated cross-reactivity of antibodies derived from dengue virus\ninfections with ZIKV, as well as antibody-mediated enhancement of\ninfection in cell culture. Therefore, there is concern among\nvaccinologists and the public health community that the more severe\ndisease manifestations could result from prior immunity, either from\nnatural infection or vaccination, to antigenically-related\nflaviviruses (such as, dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis).\nIn this study, we evaluated the impact of prior immunity to dengue or\nyellow fever virus on ZIKV infection in a non-human primate model.\nAfter confirming that our immune cohorts were capable of\nrecapitulating the published in vitro observations of cross-reactivity\nand enhancement, we looked for alteration of viral titers in\nperipheral blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, and vaginal\nsecretions, as well as alterations in gross pathology, clinical\nparameters, and immune response, as compared to our flavivirus-naïve\ncohort. Importantly, no significant differences between\nflavivirus-naïve and primed animals were observed in viral titers or\nbiofluid distribution, neutralizing antibody levels, or immune cell\nkinetics following ZIKV infection. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org)\nand\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be)(promed@promedmail.org) Previous dengue infection, whether acquired naturally or antibody\nelicited by vaccines, has been a concern due to the possibility of\nantibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) with more severe disease. This\nconcern also relates to Zika virus antibody from vaccination for\nenhancement of dengue virus infections with resulting more severe\ndisease. The monkey studies reported above indicated that this may not\nbe a problem for Zika virus vaccinated individuals. Another effort to\navoid ADE is development of a vaccine that has epitopes specific for\nZika virus that are not shared by other flaviviruses. A group of\nresearchers developed a recombinant vaccine targeting a viral envelope\nsub-unit specific to the Zika virus\n((http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/news-and-analysis/news-in-brief/researchers-find-way-to-overcome-zika-vaccinedengue-virus-conundrum/20203379.article)).\nRoland Hübner is thanked for calling this latter reference to our\nattention. - Mod.TY \n<br><br><strong>{8}</strong> Virus inhibition.\nDate: 25 Jul 2017.\nSource: Nature Communications (edited)\n(https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15672) \nref: Yu Y, Deng YQ, Zou P, et al.

We show that Z2 interacts with ZIKV surface\nprotein and disrupts the integrity of the viral membrane. Z2 can\npenetrate the placental barrier to enter fetal tissues and is safe for\nuse in pregnant mice. Intraperitoneal administration of Z2 inhibits\nvertical transmission of ZIKV in pregnant C57BL/6 mice and protects\ntype I or type I/II interferon receptor-deficient mice against lethal\nZIKV challenge.

PLoS Pathog. 2017; 13(7): e1006537. doi:\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1006537\n-\nAbstract\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted virus that can cause\nsevere defects in an infected fetus. ZIKV is also transmitted by\nsexual contact, although the relative importance of sexual\ntransmission is unclear. To better understand the role of sexual\ntransmission in ZIKV pathogenesis, a nonhuman primate (NHP) model of\nvaginal transmission was developed. ZIKV was readily transmitted to\nmature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by vaginal inoculation was\nreadily transmitted to mature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by\nvaginal individual RM with 1-5 vaginal inoculations required to\nestablish infection. After treatment with Depoprovera, a widely used\ncontraceptive progestin, 2 RM that initially resisted 8 vaginal ZIKV\ninoculations became infected after one ZIKV inoculation. Thus,\nDepoprovera seemed to enhance susceptibility to vaginal ZIKV\ntransmission. Unexpectedly, the kinetics of virus replication and\ndissemination after intravaginal ZIKV inoculation were markedly\ndifferent from RM infected with ZIKV by subcutaneous (SQ) virus\ninoculation. Several groups have reported that after SQ ZIKV\ninoculation vRNA is rapidly detected in blood plasma with vRNA less\ncommon in urine and saliva and only rarely detected in female\nreproductive tract (FRT) secretions. In contrast, in vaginally\ninoculated RM, plasma vRNA is delayed for several days and ZIKV\nreplication in, and vRNA shedding from, the FRT was found in all 6\nanimals. Further, after intravaginal transmission ZIKV RNA shedding\nfrom FRT secretions was detected before or simultaneously with plasma\nvRNA, and persisted for at least as long. Thus, ZIKV replication in\nthe FRT was independent of, and often preceded virus replication in\nthe tissues contributing to plasma vRNA. These results support the\nconclusion that ZIKV preferentially replicates in the FRT after\nvaginal transmission, but not after SQ transmission, and raise the\npossibility that there is enhanced fetal infection and pathology after\nvaginal ZIKV transmission compared to a mosquito transmitted ZIKV. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{10}</strong> _Aedes albopictus_ populations as vectors.\nDate: 2 Aug 2017.\nSource: American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (edited)\n(http://www.ajtmh.org/content/journals/10.4269/ajtmh.16-0969) \nref: Azar SR, Roundy CM, Rossi SL, et al.

Positive saliva samples were assayed for\ninfectious titer. Although all 3 mosquito populations were susceptible\nto all ZIKV strains, rates of infection, dissemination, and\ntransmission differed among mosquito and virus strains. _Aedes\nalbopictus_ from Salvador, Brazil, were the least efficient vectors,\ndemonstrating susceptibility to infection to 2 American strains of\nZIKV but failing to shed virus in saliva. Mosquitoes from the Rio\nGrande Valley were the most efficient vectors and were capable of\nshedding all 3 tested ZIKV strains into saliva after 14 days of\nextrinsic incubation. In particular, ZIKV strain DakAR 41525 (Senegal\n1954) was significantly more efficient at dissemination and saliva\ndeposition than the others tested in Rio Grande mosquitoes.

Emerg Microbes\nInfect. 2017; 6(8): e69. doi: 10.1038/emi.2017.59\n-\nAbstract\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has recently been associated\nwith an increased incidence of neonatal microcephaly and other\nneurological disorders. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito\nbite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some\ncases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main\nvector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other\nmosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the\nvirus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit\nZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of\nlaboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_.\nInterestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the\nmidgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in\nRecife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially\nfed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced.\nCollectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range\nof ZIKV vectors than anticipated. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be) Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active\nvirus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their\nability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step\ntoward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_\nfed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in\nsaliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing.\nThe study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a\ncompetent vector. Several other studies have shown this species to be\ninefficient vectors or refractory to Zika virus infection. One wonders\nif the specific _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ used or the Zika virus isolates\nwith which they were tested could account for these very different\nresults. Resolving these discrepancies is important because this\nmosquito species is very widely distributed around the world and bears\ndirectly on risk of outbreaks in geographic areas where _Aedes\naegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_ , Zika virus vectors, do not occur. -\nMod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"51":{"title":"Mumps update (24): Australia (QL), New Zealand (OT),\r\n\tBrazil (AM) ","date":["18","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Mumps update (24): Australia (QL), New Zealand (OT),\r\n\tBrazil (AM) [EXTERNAL]","summary":" A ProMED-mail post (http://www.promedmail.org) ProMED-mail is a program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases (http://www.isid.org)  In this update: <br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Australia (Cairns, Queensland) <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> New Zealand (Dunedin, Otago) <br><br><strong>{3}</strong> Brazil (Manaus, Amazonas)   <br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Australia (Cairns, Queensland).

There have been 14 cases of the highly infectious disease identified by Queensland Health since 24 Jul 2017, compared to the yearly average of only one case in the Cairns and Hinterland health district.  Tropical Public Health director Dr Steven Donohue said the mumps outbreak had spilled over to Cairns from northwest Queensland and the Northern Territory's Top End.  \"Outbreaks of mumps mainly occur because of low vaccination rates, missed doses in the past, waning immunity, or pressure of infection in overcrowded households,\" he said.  He said the viral illness was spread just like influenza, by coughing or sneezing near other people and through unwashed hands.  \"Symptoms may occur around 2 weeks after exposure if the person is not immune,\" he said. \"The illness usually lasts between 5-9 days.  \"One person in 3 who contracts mumps does not have any symptoms and doesn't realise they are sick, but they may still be contagious and infect may other people.\"  Northern Queensland Primary Health Network chief executive Robin Moore said immunisation was a simple, safe and highly effective way to protect children and adults from preventable diseases like mumps.  \"This year's 2017 increase in the number of mumps cases in the Cairns region is a timely reminder to parents that immunisation is the best protection against preventable diseases such as these.  \"We urge all members of the community to be fully vaccinated.\" ..  The disease is uncommon in developed countries, including Australia, because of the widespread use of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine.  This is given to children at 12 and 18 months, but free catch-up doses are available to anyone born after 1965 who may not have 2 recorded doses.

Three young people in Marlborough have contracted the contagious illness, with at least 1 case linked to an Auckland outbreak, while 2 have been confirmed in Nelson.  Nationally, an unusually high number of cases were reported from September 2016 to early 2017, and the Ministry of Health warned of \"an increased risk of further outbreaks\".  Auckland reported 51 cases of mumps in the past month  most aged 10 to 19  while several were recorded in Waikato earlier this year 2017.  The Auckland Regional Public Health Service said last month July 2017 it was concerned not enough people were immunised in the face of the mumps outbreak.  The MMR vaccine is usually given in 2 doses, one at 15 months old and one at 4 years old.  Most people recover from mumps, but it can have serious complications. The disease can cause inflammation of tissue surrounding the brain (meningitis), inflamed testicles or ovaries and deafness.  Men hospitalised from the Auckland outbreak had pain and swelling in their testicles, known as orchitis, which in rare cases may lead to infertility.  The outbreak in Dunedin has prompted the Otago tertiary institution's student health team to offer free measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) booster shots to students who have not had two MMR vaccinations since 1990, or are unsure of their vaccination history.  Pro-vice-chancellor of health sciences Professor Peter Crampton, the convener of the university's pandemic planning group, said the group was \"determining our ongoing response as the situation develops.\"  The outbreak coincided with a large-scale boil water notice issued for parts of Dunedin, including the student quarter, after untreated water got into part of the town's drinking water supply on Mon 14 Aug 2017.  All students and staff had been sent information about mumps. Information had been posted on social media.  Marlborough medical officer of health Dr Andrew Lindsay said mumps is \"highly contagious\". It spreads through the air by breathing, coughing and sneezing, or through contact with infected saliva; by kissing or sharing food and drink. It usually takes 12-25 days before symptoms appear  including pain in the jaw, fever, headache, and swollen glands around the face and body. People with mumps re infectious for 7 days before swelling starts and for 5 days after they cease.  Personal hygiene is essential to avoid catching mumps, including frequent hand washing, stopping coughs and sneezes in tissues, keeping at least 1 metre 3 ft away from others and ensuring kitchens and bathrooms are clean.  Dr Jill Sherwood, public health physician with the ESR (the Institute of Environmental Science and Research), earlier said the MMR vaccine was not as effective in mumps as it was in measles and rubella. \"The mumps component is only about 85 per cent effective, whereas the measles component will most likely give you lifetime coverage,\" Sherwood said.  There have been no reported cases of mumps in Canterbury, a health board spokeswoman said.

Given the\noutbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections in the region, and the\nclinical similarity of cases of that virus infection and CHIKV\ninfection, one wonders how many cases that were not laboratory\nconfirmed but clinically diagnosed as ZIKV infections were, in\nreality, CHIKV infections. It is also possible that a significant\nproportion of the population have been infected by CHIKV in the\nprevious 3 years and are now immune. It seems likely, however, that\nCHIKV is now endemic in the Americas, and sporadic, small outbreaks\nmay continue to occur as they do in Asia and Africa. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"80":{"title":"Yellow fever - Americas (56): French Guiana ","date":["22","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH/EDR> Yellow fever - Americas (56): French Guiana [EXTERNAL]","summary":"\nYELLOW FEVER - AMERICAS (56): FRENCH GUIANA\n*\nA ProMED-mail post\n(http://www.promedmail.org)\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n(http://www.isid.org).

Corr.SB, edited\n(http://www.martinique.franceantilles.fr/actualite/sante/un-cas-de-fievre-jaune-en-guyane-429923.php) \nFor the 1st time since 1998, a case of yellow fever has been confirmed\nin Guiana. It is a woman who stayed in the forest towards Saint-Élie\nand Oiapoque, in the border area with Brazil. The Institute Pasteur of Guiana yesterday Mon 21 Aug 2017 confirmed\nyellow fever virus infection in Guiana, for the 1st time since 1998.\nThe infected person died on 9 Aug 2017. She could have been infected\nin the border area of Oiapoque in Brazil, according to the initial\ninvestigations of the ARS (Agence Regional de Santé; regional health\nagency). She had been in the forest near St Elie and in the Oyapock\nValley. The mosquito control department of the CTG Collectivité Territoriale\nde Guyane  official name of French Guiana began its mosquito\ncontrol operations around the identified places of transit of the\ndeceased patient: the Cayenne hospital centre, the Kourou medical and\nsurgical centre; the surrounding forest of Saint-Élie; degradation of\nPetit Saut; the lower Oyapock. The ARS recommends that unvaccinated people who present with symptoms\nand who have visited the area since 15 Aug 2017 should consult their\ndoctor without delay. Unvaccinated people can be vaccinated at most\ngeneral practitioners and at the following centres: - CPS of the Red Cross, - traveller centre or CDPS of the Centre Hospitalier de Cayenne,\n- PMI centers of the CTG. The ARS reminds all that vaccination is the main prevention measure\nagainst yellow fever. Transmission to humans, symptoms and treatments:\n\nYellow fever is an acute viral disease transmissible from animal\n(monkey) to man and man to man by various mosquitoes (genus _Aedes_,\nbut also other genera circulating in the forest). The yellow fever\nvirus is transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito. After an incubation period of about one week, the disease is\ncharacterized by fever, chills, muscle pain, headache, nausea,\nvomiting. Severe forms (hemorrhage, liver disorders, kidney problems)\ncan develop in 15 per cent of cases. Vaccination is the main prevention measure against yellow fever. The\nvaccine is safe, and very effective, a single dose is usually enough\nto give lasting immunity and lifetime protection against the disease.\nIn 30 days, it gives an effective immune protection to 99 per cent of\nvaccinated subjects. In case of yellow fever, symptomatic treatment may be proposed\n(rehydration, antipyretic medicines to limit fever, vomiting and pain,\nantibiotics for superinfections). \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) It is hard to know if this case is related to this year's (2017)\nyellow fever (YF) outbreak in Brazil. The Brazilian state of Amapá\nborders French Guiana, but there have been no reported YF cases in\nhumans or in non-human primates in the state. However, French Guiana\nis endemic for YF and the area where the woman was infected is\nforested and is likely to have foci of sylvan (forest) YF. Yellow\nfever was detected in 1951 in French Guiana and YF immunization has\nbeen compulsory there since 1967. In the year 2000, a cluster survey\nshowed that immunization coverage in the population was estimated at\n80-90 per cent, depending on the age category\n(http://www.invs.sante.fr/publications/2002/couv_vaccin_guyane/r_couv_vaccin_guyane.pdf). The last case of autochthonous YF notified in Guiana before the one\ncited above occurred in 1998 in a town on the border with Surinam.\nSince then, the compulsory notification system built around all health\ncare structures and a reference laboratory at Cayenne's Pasteur\nInstitute have received no notification of Yellow fever cases until\nnow. Health authorities in French Guiana are wise to emphasize\nvaccination as the best preventive measure against YF. One hopes that\nthis is an isolated case, and not an indication of ongoing YF virus\ntransmission in the country or in neighboring Amapá state in Brazil.

Date: Tue 22 Aug 2017.\nSource: Outbreak News Today (edited)\n(http://outbreaknewstoday.com/oropouche-virus-emerge-cause-public-health-problem-93070/) \nAfter the Zika epidemic, which began in 2015, and the outbreak of\nyellow fever early in 2017, Brazil runs a serious risk of being\nafflicted by Oropouche, another virus that is widely distributed\nthroughout South and Central America and the Caribbean. Oropouche has\nadapted to urban environments and is moving ever closer to Brazil's\nmajor cities. An arbovirus transmitted by a mosquito (like Zika and\nyellow fever), Oropouche causes acute fever and may lead to meningitis\nand meningoencephalitis (inflammation of the brain and meninges). \"Oropouche is a virus that could potentially emerge at any moment and\ncause a serious public health problem in Brazil,\" said Luiz Tadeu\nMoraes Figueiredo, a professor at the University of São Paulo's\nRibeirão Preto Medical School (FMRP-USP). Figueiredo is a researcher\nfor a Thematic Project supported by the São Paulo Research Foundation\n(FAPESP) focusing on emerging zoonotic viroses. According to him, about 500 000 cases of Oropouche fever have been\nreported in Brazil in recent decades but that the number of cases will\ngrow because the virus, transmitted by the midge _Culicoides\nparaensis_, is no longer found only in Amazonian villages and is\nspreading to the big cities. \"_C. paraensis_ is distributed throughout\nthe Americas, and Oropouche virus therefore has considerable emergence\npotential,\" he said. \"The virus may well spread from the Amazon region\nand central plateau to the most densely populated regions of the\ncountry.\" The incidence of Oropouche fever is also rising in urban areas of Peru\nand Caribbean countries. In Brazil, the virus has been isolated from\nbirds in Rio Grande do Sul state and from a marmoset in Minas Gerais\nstate. The presence of neutralizing antibodies (which bind to the\nvirus, tell the immune system to destroy it, and prevent it from\ninfecting the organism) has been detected in primates in the city of\nGoiânia Goiás state. \"We recently diagnosed a patient from Ilhéus\ncity in the northeastern state of Bahia with Oropouche fever, in\npartnership with Eurico Arruda a professor in FMRP-USP's Department\nof Cellular Biology. This shows the virus is circulating around\nBrazil,\" Figueiredo said. In 2002, researchers at FMRP-USP diagnosed 128 people infected by\nOropouche virus in Manaus, Amazonas state's capital city. They\npresented with typical symptoms of the infection, such as acute fever,\njoint pain, headache, and pain behind the eyes; 3 also developed a\ncentral nervous system infection. \"The virus was found in these\npatients' cerebrospinal fluid,\" Figueiredo said. The researchers were\nintrigued to find that one of these 3 patients had neurocysticercosis,\nan infection of the central nervous system caused by the pork tapeworm\n_Taenia solium_, and another had AIDS. \"This shows that some\nimmunodepressive diseases can facilitate penetration of the central\nnervous system by the virus. Hardly anyone thinks of this when\ntreating an arbovirus infection, but the possibility must be\nconsidered,\" Figueiredo said. The 128 patients with Oropouche in Manaus had been clinically\ndiagnosed with dengue fever. The Oropouche and dengue viruses produce\nsimilar symptoms. For this reason, researchers at FMRP-USP and other\ninstitutions such as Fundação Oswaldo Cruz Fiocruz have begun to\nwarn that many suspected cases of dengue in Brazil may be cases of\ninfection by Oropouche. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) Oropouche virus is endemic in Brazil and many other countries in\nSouth and Central America and the Caribbean. The report above\nindicates that it is spreading, as the biting midge vector,\n_Culicoides paraensis_, becomes more urbanized in its distribution.\nThe results of blood samples taken in 20 municipalities in Amazonas\nstate indicate the presence of the virus of Oropouche fever. This has\nbeen confirmed by Fiocruz Amazonia in an investigation carried out\ntogether with state health surveillance. The sampling corresponds to\nthe 2011-2016 period. In total, 306 individuals were investigated, and\n9 positives were found among them (see Oropouche virus - Brazil\nhttp://promedmail.org/post/20170814.5247798). Surveillance will need to be intensified, with corresponding\nlaboratory support, to be able to differentiate Oropouche virus\ninfection from infections caused by dengue, chikungunya, and Zika\nviruses. Oropouche virus is a bunyavirus of the Simbu group. No\nvaccine is available, so avoidance of bites by the vector midge is the\nbest preventive measure.

It is rare in humans. It is\nunclear what symptoms occurred in the person and how the diagnosis was\nmade. The following appears to be the most recent review of _B. mallei_\ninfections in humans including the description of disease\nmanifestations:\nVan Zandt KE, Greer MT, Gelhaus HC. Glanders: an overview of infection\nin humans. Orphanet J Rare Dis. 2013 Sep 3;8:131. doi:\n10.1186/1750-1172-8-131 (the full text and citations can be found at\nthe original URL\n(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3766238/)). \"Features of human clinical glanders\n\n\"General symptoms\n\"Many forms of glanders have been described, including chronic,\ndisseminated, pulmonary, and septicemic. The variety of infections is\nlargely explained by various routes of infection. Localized infections\nare generally regionally confined and typically characterized by foci\nof suppuration. The abscesses can ulcerate and drain for long periods\nof time. However, localized infections may disseminate, leading to\npulmonary, septicemic, or multi-tissue infection <br><br><strong>{9}</strong>. The most common\nclinical features of the eight laboratory-acquired infections from\nFort Detrick included (in order of most common occurrence) afternoon\nto evening low-grade fever, malaise, fatigue, headache, myalgias\nincluding backache, lymphadenopathy, and chest pain. Approximately\nhalf of the patients not only felt better but were also clinically\nbetter for a period of time after the first wave of disease symptoms.\nThis period lasted from a few days to 2 months then patients developed\nclinical signs of infection. \"Mucosal involvement\n\"Involvement of the eye and conjunctiva in a _B. mallei_ infection\npresents with excessive lacrimation and photophobia. Nasal involvement\nis characterized by inflammation and swelling of the nose, which is\ncommon following inhalation of _B. mallei_. This may be followed by\ncopious nasal discharge. Additionally, infection may invade the nasal\nseptum and bony tissues, causing fistulae and tissue destruction <br><br><strong>{9}</strong>.\nThe face may swell and regional lymph nodes may become inflamed.\nInfection may also extend lower in the respiratory tract, resulting in\nbronchitis which can be accompanied by cough and mucopurulent sputum\nproduction. Constitutional signs and symptoms such as fever and chills\ntypically occur within the first few days following infection.\nAdditionally, these symptoms may persist through treatment and be\nsevere. Common signs and symptoms can include, but are not limited to,\nfever or low-grade fever in the afternoon to evening; chills with or\nwithout rigors; and severe headache <br><br><strong>{9}</strong>. \"Cutaneous involvement\n\"Cutaneous manifestations include papular lesions that may erupt\nanywhere on the body with a more chronic, indolent course of\ninfection. _B. mallei_ entry through an abrasion is typically followed\nby an inflammatory response, including pain and swelling. In these\ncases, a glanders node may appear as a single blister, gradually\ndeveloping into an ulcer that may become hemorrhagic 18,35. A\nlocalized infection with a discharge typically develops at the entry\nsite. Inflammation may extend along regional lymphatics and cause\nlymphangitis with numerous foci of suppuration along their course. The\nendotoxins present in _B. mallei_ strains affect the smooth muscle of\nthe lymphatics <br><br><strong>{9}</strong> by enhancing the irritation and inflammation seen\nin the lymphatics. \"Pulmonary involvement\n\"A pulmonary infection typically results in pneumonia, pulmonary\nabscess, pleuritis, and plural effusion. Signs and symptoms of\npulmonary infection can include cough, dyspnea, chest pain, and\nmucoplurent sputum. Nonspecific signs and symptoms such as fatigue,\nfever (often exceeding 102 deg F 38.9 deg C), chills, headache,\nmyalgias, lymphangitis, sore throat, pleuritic chest pain, cough,\ntachypnea, dyspnea, discharge, and gastrointestinal signs often\naccompany respiratory infections <br><br><strong>{9}</strong>. Many symptoms may take up to 2\nto 3 weeks to develop. Nonspecific signs, such as dizziness, rigors,\nmyalgia, nausea, night sweats, severe headache, tachycardia, weight\nloss, and mucosal eruptions are also usually present and may indicate\na disseminated infection <br><br><strong>{9}</strong>. \"Dissemination of infection\n\"Dissemination from local cutaneous or mucosal infection result in\nsepticemia and the colonization of internal organs such as the spleen,\nliver, and lungs with the development of abscesses <br><br><strong>{9}</strong>.\nUltrasonography and computed tomography may reveal multiple, small\ndiscrete abscesses in both the liver and the kidney <br><br><strong>{23}</strong>. These\ninfections are typically associated with septic shock and high\nmortality.\" This publication describes what seems to have been the last of the\ncases of human _B. mallei_ in the USA:\nSrinivasan A, Kraus CN, DeShazer D, et al. Glanders in a military\nresearch microbiologist. N Engl J Med. 2001; 345: 256-8; (full text\nand citations can be found at the original URL\n(http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200107263450404) \"Infection with _Burkholderia mallei_ (formerly _Pseudomonas mallei_)\ncan cause a subcutaneous infection known as farcy or can disseminate\nto cause the condition known as glanders. In humans, acute infection\nwith _B. mallei_ is characterized by necrosis of the tracheobronchial\ntree, pustular skin lesions, and either a febrile pneumonia, if the\norganism was inhaled, or signs of sepsis and multiple abscesses, if\nthe skin was the portal of entry (1). At the turn of the 20th century,\nglanders was an important cause of death among horses, and there were\nsecondary, often fatal, infections in humans (2). Because of the\nlethal and contagious nature of the disease, _B. mallei_ was\nconsidered an ideal agent for biologic warfare and was used for this\npurpose by Germany in World War I (3). \"Aggressive control measures essentially eliminated glanders from the\nWest. However, with the resurgent concern about biologic warfare, _B.\nmallei_ is now being studied in laboratories worldwide. We describe\nhere the first reported case of human glanders in the USA in more than\n50 years and discuss some of the important events in the history of\nthe disease and its initial eradication. \"Case report\n\n\"In March 2000, tender, left axillary adenopathy and fever\n(temperature, 38.6 deg C 101.5 deg F) developed in a 33 year old\nmicrobiologist at the US Army Medical Research Institute for\nInfectious Diseases who had type 1 diabetes mellitus. The patient had\nworked for 2 years investigating the basic microbiology of _B. mallei_\nand did not routinely wear latex gloves. The adenopathy and fever\npersisted despite treatment for 10 days with a first-generation\ncephalosporin. An evaluation after this treatment, which included\nchest radiography as well as cultures of blood and urine, was\nunrevealing. During the next few weeks, the patient had increasing\nfatigue, night sweats, malaise, rigors, and weight loss. \"In early April 2000, his symptoms and adenopathy resolved during a\n10-day course of clarithromycin, but he relapsed 4 days after the\nmedication was stopped. On 2 May 2000, he was admitted to his local\nhospital with diabetic ketoacidosis. A computed tomographic (CT) scan\nshowed multiple hepatic and splenic abscesses. \"On 4 May 2000, respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation\ndeveloped, and the patient was transferred to Johns Hopkins Hospital\nin Baltimore. Physical examination revealed a temperature of 40.3 deg\nC 104.5 deg F and a heart rate of 122 beats per minute. The patient\nhad a grade 2/6 systolic murmur, coarse breath sounds, and moderate\nepigastric tenderness. Laboratory studies showed a white-cell count of\n8300 per cubic millimeter, with 83 per cent neutrophils, 9 per cent\nmonocytes, and 8 per cent lymphocytes. The hematocrit was 25.6 per\ncent. The concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine\naminotransferase were 53 U per liter and 56 U per liter, respectively,\nand the alkaline phosphatase was 197 IU per liter. Cultures of the\npatient's blood and a sample from a fine-needle aspiration biopsy of a\nliver abscess grew a small, bipolar, weakly staining, gram-negative\nrod that was identified by an automated bacterial-identification\nsystem as _Pseudomonas fluorescens_ or _P. putida_. However,\ngas-liquid chromatography of the cellular fatty acids (Microbial ID,\nNewark, Del.) placed the organism in the genus _Burkholderia_.\nSubsequent phenotypic testing and 16S ribosomal RNA gene-sequence\nanalysis identified the organism as _B. mallei_. Initial\nsusceptibility testing showed the isolate to be sensitive to imipenem,\nceftazidime, and tetracycline. \"The patient was treated with imipenem and doxycycline, and there was\nrapid improvement. After two weeks, the imipenem was replaced by\nazithromycin, and the patient completed a six-month course of\ntreatment with azithromycin and doxycycline. Although the organism was\nfound retrospectively to be relatively resistant to azithromycin, a CT\nscan obtained after six months of treatment showed substantial\nimprovement of the liver and spleen abscesses, and one year later the\npatient remained in good health. \"Discussion\n\nThis is the 1st reported human case of glanders in the\nEnglish-language medical literature since 1949 (4) and it occurred in\nthe context of research on agents of biologic warfare. \"Glanders may have been the first biologic weapon of the 20th century.\nDuring World War I, Germany had a program of biologic sabotage against\nseveral countries, including the United States, whereby cultures of\n_B. mallei_ and anthrax were distributed to undercover agents who\nattempted to infect livestock that were to be shipped to Allied\ncountries (3). The intention was both the destruction of livestock and\nthe transmission of the highly contagious, lethal agent from livestock\nto humans. It is currently suspected that attempts are being made to\ndevelop an aerosolized form of antibiotic-resistant _B. mallei_ that\ncould become a biologic weapon as potent as anthrax. \"Glanders, an important human and veterinary disease, was eliminated\nwithout a vaccine or effective treatment. It appears to have been\nabolished by the veterinary use of a skin test to detect exposure to\nB. mallei combined with draconian agricultural measures to control\ninfection (5). \"At the turn of the 20th century, Canada, Britain, and the USA all\nimplemented glanders-control programs. By that time, the symptoms of\nequine glanders, which include fever and inflammation of the nasal\nmucosa with ultimate necrosis and obstruction of the oropharynx, had\nbeen well described (6). Laws were passed that required notification\nof the health department and the immediate slaughter of affected\nanimals, with proper disposal of the carcasses. In addition, all\nhorses on the premises where the infected horses were found had to be\ntested with the mallein skin test for exposure to _B. mallei_; any\nhorses with a reaction also had to be slaughtered. Horses with no\nreaction were quarantined and then retested two to three weeks later.\nFurthermore, the equine contacts of the horses were traced to track\ndown other horses that might have been exposed and then moved to other\nfacilities. \"The case we describe illustrates the major clinical features of\nglanders, which can usually be traced to direct contact with _B.\nmallei_, as in workers exposed to animals with glanders (7) and in\npersonnel who were exposed in laboratories during World War II (8).\nAlthough the patient discussed here could not recall a clear break in\nhis skin or an accident in the laboratory, most reported occupational\ninfections occur without recognized instances of exposure (9). As\nRobins commented in 1906, \"It is perhaps not advisable to be too\ndogmatic as to the invariable necessity of an abrasion being present\nin every case of human glanders . . . as in several such cases of\nour series it is distinctly stated that there was no abrasion.\" (7).\nAs in our patient, _B. mallei_ often enters the body through the hand\nor arm. After an incubation period lasting between a few days and\nseveral weeks, local suppuration and regional lymphadenopathy occur.\nConstitutional symptoms often accompany the infection, with fever,\nrigors, and malaise predominating. If the infection is left untreated,\nabscesses in the lymph nodes will generally form, then break down and\ndrain. \"Dissemination of the infection occurs 1 to 4 weeks after infection of\nthe lymph nodes. Abscesses can be widespread, and _B. mallei_ can\ninfect almost any tissue (7). Abscesses in the liver and the spleen,\nas were seen in our patient, appear to be relatively common, as does\npulmonary involvement, including consolidation, abscesses, and pleural\nnodules. The acute onset and rapid resolution of the respiratory\nfailure in our patient were more consistent with the respiratory\ndistress syndrome associated with gram-negative bacteremia than with\nthat associated with pulmonary glanders. Subcutaneous and\nintramuscular abscesses sometimes develop as well (7). \"There are few data regarding the antibiotic treatment of glanders,\nsince the disease had largely disappeared by the time antibiotics\nbecame available. In vitro, ceftazidime, gentamicin, imipenem,\ndoxycycline, and ciprofloxacin all have reliable activity against _B.\nmallei_ (10), and our patient's infection responded well to a\ncombination of imipenem and doxycycline. Experimentally induced\nglanders also responds to a combination of sulfazine and trimethoprim\n(11). However, treatment of the disease in the setting of bioterrorism\nmay be more difficult if the organism is drug-resistant. \"This case demonstrates the difficulties that microbiology\nlaboratories may have in recognizing potential agents of biologic\nwarfare. These microbes are rarely encountered and may be\nmisidentified by conventional, phenotypic identification systems.\nTechniques such as cellular analysis of fatty acid and 16S ribosomal\nRNA gene sequencing can be used to identify the organisms correctly,\nbut these tests are not widely available. \"Finally, this case may serve as a harbinger of the resurgence of\nnearly forgotten diseases such as glanders, plague, smallpox, and\nanthrax. Research on these diseases is now being conducted in more\nlaboratories, which increases the risk of occupational exposure.

The recent outbreaks of ZIKV in Brazil and French\nPolynesia have been linked to a considerable increase in the incidence\nof fetal microcephaly and other diseases such as Guillain-Barre\nsyndrome. Because there is currently no specific therapy or vaccine,\nthe early exploitation of a method to prevent expansion of ZIKV is a\nhigh priority. To validate commonly used antiviral drugs, we evaluated\nthe effect of ribavirin, a drug used to treat hepatitis C with\ninterferon-beta (IFN-beta), on ZIKV replication. In mammalian cells,\nwe observed an inhibitory effect of ribavirin on ZIKV replication and\nZIKV-induced cell death without cytotoxic effect. Furthermore, we\nfound that STAT1-deficient mice, which lack type I IFN signaling, were\nhighly sensitive to ZIKV infection and exhibited lethal outcome.\nRibavirin abrogated viremia in ZIKV-infected STAT-1-deficient mice.\nThese data suggest that the inhibition of viral RNA-dependent RNA\npolymerases may be effective for treatment of ZIKV infection. Our data\nprovide a new insight into the mechanisms for inhibition of ZIKV\nreplication and prevention of Zika fever. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) It will be interesting to see if these encouraging results showing\ninhibition of Zika virus replication can be replicated in non-human\nprimates. The challenge for use of drugs to inhibit Zika virus\ninfection in humans is that most (around 80 percent) Zika virus\ninfections are asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms. These\nindividuals will probably not seek medical treatment, even though\ntheir fetuses are at risk of infection with teratogenic effects. -\nMod.TY \n<br><br><strong>{3}</strong> Zika virus skewed immunosuppression.\nDate: Mon 21 Aug 2017.\nSource: Nature Microbiology journal (edited)\n(http://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-017-0016-3) \nref: Foo SS, Chen W, Chan Y, et al. Asian Zika virus strains target\nCD14+ blood monocytes and induce M2-skewed immunosuppression during\npregnancy. Nat Microbiol. 2017. doi: 10.1038/s41564-017-0016-3\n-\nAbstract\nBlood CD14+ monocytes are frontline immunomodulators categorized into\nclassical, intermediate or non-classical subsets, and subsequently\ndifferentiated into M1 pro- or M2 anti-inflammatory macrophages on\nstimulation. Although the Zika virus (ZIKV) rapidly establishes\nviraemia, the target cells and immune responses, particularly during\npregnancy, remain elusive. Furthermore, it is unknown whether African-\nand Asian-lineage ZIKV have different phenotypic impacts on host\nimmune responses. Using human blood infection, we identified CD14+\nmonocytes as the primary target for African- or Asian-lineage ZIKV\ninfection. When immunoprofiles of human blood infected with ZIKV were\ncompared, a classical/intermediate monocyte-mediated M1-skewed\ninflammation by the African-lineage ZIKV infection was observed, in\ncontrast to a non-classical monocyte-mediated M2-skewed\nimmunosuppression by the Asian-lineage ZIKV infection. Importantly,\ninfection of the blood of pregnant women revealed an enhanced\nsusceptibility to ZIKV infection. Specifically, Asian-lineage ZIKV\ninfection of pregnant women's blood led to an exacerbated M2-skewed\nimmunosuppression of non-classical monocytes in conjunction with a\nglobal suppression of type I interferon-signaling pathway and an\naberrant expression of host genes associated with pregnancy\ncomplications. Also, 30 ZIKV+ sera from symptomatic pregnant patients\nshowed elevated levels of M2-skewed immunosuppressive cytokines and\npregnancy-complication-associated fibronectin-1. This study\ndemonstrates the differential immunomodulatory responses of blood\nmonocytes, particularly during pregnancy, on infection with different\nlineages of ZIKV. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{4}</strong> Virus alters mosquito genes.\nDate: Tue 22 Aug 2017.\nSource: bioRxiv journal (edited)\n(http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/22/179416) \nref: Etebari K, Hegde S, Saldana MA, et al. Global transcriptome\nanalysis of _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes in response to Zika virus\ninfection. bioRxiv 179416; doi:10.1101/179416\n-\nZika virus (ZIKV) of the Flaviviridae family is a recently emerged\nmosquito-borne virus that has been implicated in the surge of the\nnumber of microcephaly instances in South America. The recent rapid\nspread of the virus led to its declaration as a global health\nemergency by the World Health Organization. The virus is transmitted\nmainly by the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_ that also vectors dengue virus,\nhowever little is known about the interactions of the virus with the\nmosquito vector. In this study, we investigated the transcriptome\nprofiles of whole _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes in response to ZIKV\ninfection at 2, 7, and 14 days post-infection using RNA-Seq. Results\nshowed changes in the abundance of a large number of transcripts at\neach time point following infection, with 18 transcripts commonly\nchanged among the 3 time points. Gene ontology analysis revealed that\nmost of the altered genes are involved in metabolic process, cellular\nprocess and proteolysis. In addition, 486 long intergenic non-coding\nRNAs were identified altered upon ZIKV infection. Further, we found\ncorrelational changes of a number of potential mRNA target genes with\nthat of altered host microRNAs. The outcomes provide a basic\nunderstanding of _Ae. aegypti_ responses to ZIKV and helps to\ndetermine host factors involved in replication or mosquito host\nanti-viral response against the virus. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) Mosquito vector competence depends on the relationship of virus and\nthe mosquito, and the defenses that the mosquito can mobilize against\nthe virus infection. Studies, such as the one above, can document the\nchanges that occur when the virus infects the mosquito, and if\ndifferences in relative vector efficiency of different geographic\nstrains of this mosquito might be related to alternations in mosquito\ngenes when infected. It would be interesting to know if these gene\nchanges affect fitness, and especially longevity of infected\nmosquitoes. - Mod.TY \n<br><br><strong>{5}</strong> Virus effects on sperm, body fluids.\nDate: Mon 21 Aug 2017.\nSource: The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal (edited)\n(http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(17)30444-9/abstract) \nref: Joguet G, Mansuy JM, Matusali G, et al.

To investigate the effects of Zika\nvirus infection on semen and clearance of Zika virus from semen and\nbody fluids, we aimed to study a cohort of Zika virus-infected men. Methods\nThis prospective observational study recruited men presenting with\nacute Zika virus infection at Pointe-Ã -Pitre University Hospital in\nGuadeloupe, French Caribbean, where a Zika virus outbreak occurred\nbetween April and November, 2016. Blood, urine, and semen were\ncollected at days 7, 11, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 after symptom onset,\nand semen characteristics, such as total sperm count, sperm motility,\nvitality, and morphology, and reproductive hormone concentrations,\nsuch as testosterone, inhibin, follicle-stimulating hormone, and\nluteinising hormone, were assessed. At days 7, 11, and 20, semen was\nprocessed to isolate motile spermatozoa. Zika virus RNA was detected\nby RT-PCR using whole blood, serum, urine, seminal plasma, semen\ncells, and motile spermatozoa fractions. Zika virus was isolated from\ndifferent sperm fractions on Vero E6 cultures. Findings\n15 male volunteers (mean age 35 years SD 5; range 25-44) with acute\nZika virus infection and positive Zika virus RNA detection in blood or\nurine were enrolled. Total sperm count was decreased from median\n119âÃâ10^6 spermatozoa (IQR interquartile range 22-234)\nat day 7, to 45.2âÃâ10^6 (16.5-89.6) at day 30, and 70\nÃ 10^6 (28.5-81.4) at day 60, respectively, after Zika virus\ninfection. Inhibin values increased from 93.5 pg/mL (IQR 55-162) at\nday 7 to 150 pg/mL (78-209) at day 120 when total sperm count\nrecovered. In motile spermatozoa obtained after density gradient\nseparation, Zika virus RNA was found in 3 of 14 patients at day 7, 4\nof 15 at day 11, and 4 of 15 at day 20, and replication-competent\nvirus was found in the tested patient. Seminal shedding kinetics\nseemed heterogeneous among patients. Whole blood was the fluid most\nfrequently positive for Zika virus RNA (62 of 92 samples) and 3\npatients remained positive at day 120. Interpretation\nSemen alterations early after acute Zika virus infection might affect\nfertility and could be explained by virus effects on the testis and\nepididymis. Frequency of shedding and high viral load in semen,\ntogether with the presence of replicative virus in a motile\nspermatozoa fraction, can lead to Zika virus transmission during\nsexual contact and assisted reproduction procedures. Whole blood seems\nto be the best specimen for Zika virus RNA detection, diagnosis, and\nfollow-up. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall In a new study that included 12 men in French Guiana who had Zika\nvirus, 4 never had any detectable Zika in their semen, 1 excreted Zika\nvirus in his semen for at least 3 days, and 7 had Zika virus in semen\nfor at least 1 month.

Vaccines protect fetus from Zika. JAMA. 2017; 318(8):\n689. doi:10.1001/jama.2017.11200\n-\nResearchers funded in part by the National Institutes of Health have\nrecently demonstrated that 2 experimental vaccines can restrict\ntransmission of Zika virus from pregnant mice to their fetuses,\nthereby shielding offspring from congenital damage or death. Multiple candidate Zika vaccines have been shown protective against\ninfection with the virus in animal studies, with several now in human\ntrials, but none were tested in the context of pregnancy, according to\nthe authors of the study published in Cell\n(http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(17)30759-6). The 2\nvaccine candidates investigated in the new study are the 1st to\ndemonstrate efficacy in preventing vertical transmission of the virus\nand related fetal death in an animal model. Although the vaccines were\nadministered to female mice prior to pregnancy, the result is\nconsidered an important step toward developing a vaccine that could be\nsafely given to pregnant women. One of the 2 candidates is a modified messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine\nencoding Zika genes, developed by the biotechnology company Moderna.\nIt is already in safety trials in women who are not pregnant. The\nother is a live-attenuated Zika strain developed by researchers at the\nUniversity of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). The testing was carried out by scientists from the National Institute\nof Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Washington University School of\nMedicine, and UTMB. The researchers 1st vaccinated the mice with 1 of\nthe vaccines or a placebo. After mating, the animals were challenged\nwith the virus 6 days into pregnancy. A week later, more than 50\npercent of placentas and fetuses from mice administered the mRNA\nvaccine had virtually no Zika RNA. The remainder had \"substantially\nlower\" levels relative to placebo.\nThe live vaccine provided broader protection: 78 percent of placentas\nand 83 percent of fetuses had Zika RNA at or below the level of\ndetection, while the placebo group exhibited significantly higher\nlevels of placental and fetal Zika RNA. Mice vaccinated with either\nvaccine had significantly higher rates of fetal viability; whereas 100\npercent of fetuses from mice vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine were\nborn, none survived to term in the placebo group. A working group funded by the Wellcome Trust recently approved ethical\nguidelines for testing such vaccines in pregnant women, normally\nexcluded from drug trials. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) It is reassuring to learn that at least 2 vaccines are now entering\nclinical trials in women. Although anti-Zika virus drugs are under\ndevelopment, preventing infection through vaccination seems to be the\nmost effective measure to prevent fetal infection and adverse effects\nof the virus infection in adults. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"160":{"title":"Inappropriate vaccinia virus use - USA: (CA) stem cell clinic\r\n\t","date":["28","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Inappropriate vaccinia virus use - USA: (CA) stem cell clinic\r\n\t[EXTERNAL]","summary":"\nINAPPROPRIATE VACCINIA VIRUS USE - USA: (CALIFORNIA) STEM CELL CLINIC\n*\nA ProMED-mail post\n(http://www.promedmail.org)\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n(http://www.isid.org). Date: Mon 28 Aug 2017.\nSource: New York Times (edited)\n(https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/28/health/fda-stem-cell.html?_r=1) \nThe FDA US Food and Drug Administration announced a crackdown on\ndangerous stem cell clinics on Mon 28 Aug 2017, while at the same\ntime pledging to ease the path to approval for companies and doctors\nwith legitimate treatments in the growing field. The agency reported\nactions against 2 large stem cell clinics and a biotech company,\nsaying that it was critical to shut down \"unscrupulous actors\" in\nregenerative medicine, a broad umbrella that includes stem cell and\ngene therapies and immunotherapies. \"The FDA will not allow deceitful\nactors to take advantage of vulnerable patients by purporting to have\ntreatments or cures for serious diseases without any proof that they\nactually work,\" said Dr Scott Gottlieb, the FDA commissioner. Stem cells, which can be extracted from bone marrow, blood, or fat,\ncan develop into many different types of cells, and are thought to\nhave the potential to repair or replace tissue damaged by disease,\ninjury, or aging. But so far, the FDA has approved only a few\nstem-cell products. The companies that the FDA cited have been performing liposuction to\nremove belly fat from patients, extracting stem cells and then\ninjecting those cells back into the patients to treat various\nailments. On Fri 25 Aug 2017, the agency said, federal marshals seized 500\ndoses of live vaccinia virus vaccine for smallpox belonging to\nStemImmune Inc., a San Diego firm that develops stem cell-based\nimmunotherapies for cancer. The raid came after the FDA learned that\nthe vaccine was being used to create an unapproved stem cell product,\na combination of excess amounts of vaccine and stem cells derived from\nbody fat, which was then administered to cancer patients with\npotentially compromised immune systems. The FDA said patients at the\nCalifornia Stem Cell Treatment Centers in Rancho Mirage and Beverly\nHills, California, received the treatment made with the smallpox\nvaccine. It also said it had serious concerns about how StemImmune\nobtained the vaccine for use in an unapproved and potentially\ndangerous treatment. StemImmune obtained at least some of the vaccine from the CDC,\naccording to Thomas Skinner, a CDC spokesman. In its request, the\ncompany said it was conducting cancer research involving the vaccinia\nvirus, and needed to vaccinate researchers  a seemingly legitimate\nreason. The company did not tell the CDC that it was going to inject\nthe vaccine into patients, he said. A statement from StemImmune said\nthe company had lawfully obtained the drug. The FDA also issued a warning letter to US Stem Cell, a private clinic\nin Sunrise, Florida. The company was the subject of a March 2017\nreport in The New England Journal of Medicine, describing how one\nwoman went blind and 2 others suffered severe, permanent eye damage\nafter being given shots of stem cells, extracted from fat, into their\neyes. The warning letter accused the company of impairing the FDA's\nability to conduct its inspection by refusing to allow inspectors in,\nand denying them access to employees. It also said that US Stem Cell\nhad failed to establish proper quality control and sanitary\nstandards. The entire article related to FDA issues with stem cell clinics can\nbe found at the source URL above. - Mod.LL Byline: Sheila Kaplan, Denise Grady \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) Clearly scientifically inappropriate use of stem cells by\n\"unscrupulous\" clinics is occurring as discussed in the article above.\nThe posting of this on ProMED was precipitated by the report of the\nsmallpox vaccine, referred to as vaccinia, administered with stem\ncells by injecting directly into a tumor. The current vaccine\n\"ACAM2000\" is the same virus as the former \"Dryvax\" except that the\nvirus is grown in tissue culture rather than from inoculation of\ncalves. The only approved indication for the vaccine is to protect\nindividuals who are working with variations of the vaccinia vaccine in\nlaboratories and for military personnel or others who theoretically\ncould be exposed to smallpox as a biowarfare event. I recently immunized several dozen laboratory workers with ACAM2000\nrelated to work they will be doing with a recombinant vaccinia virus\nin an animal model. In order to obtain the vaccine, we had to fill out\na request form with a list of individuals to be immunized. As a\nreminder, the technique for immunization is \"scarification\" where a\nsmall amount of the reconstituted virus is introduced into the skin\nusing a bifurcated needle\n((https://jetinfectors.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/bifurcated-needle-1.jpg?w=401&h=261)).\nThe primary \"take\" is a vesicle/pustule developing about 7 days later\n(shown at\n(http://health.mo.gov/emergencies/ert/pdf/SmallpoxVaccinationReactions.pdf)).\nOne contraindication for use is in immunocompromised hosts (including\nsome patients with cancer) and the virus is never inoculated by other\ntechniques. More information about vaccination can be obtained from\nthe CDC at (https://www.cdc.gov/smallpox/vaccine-basics/index.html). Currently in press in Lancet Infectious Diseases, Clarissa Damaso from\nInstituto de Biofísica Carlos Chagas Filho, Universidade Federal do\nRio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil has written an excellent review\non the history of smallpox vaccines: Damaso CR: Revisiting Jenner's mysteries, the role of the Beaugency\nlymph in the evolutionary path of ancient smallpox vaccines. Lancet\nInfect Dis. 2017. pii: S1473-3099(17)30445-0. doi:\n10.1016/S1473-3099(17)30445-0; full text, references, and figures\navailable at\n(http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/laninf/PIIS1473-3099(17)30445-0.pdf): \"The origins of Jenner's vaccine have been intensively debated over\nthe years. British researcher Downie studied the close immunological\nrelationship of variola, cowpox, and vaccinia viruses, which led him\nto propose in 1951 that vaccinia virus had emerged from cowpox virus\nin the early years of vaccination (26). In 1965, Downie strongly\nopposed Peter Razzell's proposal that vaccinia virus had derived from\nan attenuated form of variola virus (27-29). Derrick Baxby (1940-2017)\nalso refuted Razzell's belief and proposed in 1981 that modern 20th\ncentury vaccines had derived from horsepox virus (30-32). In fact, we\ncurrently know that vaccinia virus is more closely related to horsepox\nvirus than to cowpox virus. On the basis of full-genome analysis and\nrecent phylogenetic inferences, horsepox virus is considered an\nancestor of the vaccinia lineage (33-36). Because all modern smallpox\nvaccine strains consist of vaccinia virus, one would expect that\nhorsepox virus, or even vaccinia virus, would be better candidates\nthan cowpox virus for the original source of Jenner's vaccine.\nAlthough an attractive hypothesis, the obscure history of cowpox,\nhorsepox, and vaccinia viruses further adds to the mystery. Since the\nmid-20th century, cows have been rarely found sick because of\ninfection by cowpox virus, and only felines, pet rodents, and zoo\nanimals, primarily in Europe, have been affected by the virus in the\npast decades (37-40). As for horsepox, the disease is rare and some\nbelieve it is extinct, at least in Europe (23,24,31,32,41). Only one\nexisting strain of horsepox virus obtained from Mongolian horses in\n1976 is currently known (33). However, vaccinia virus has never been\nfound naturally occurring in animals, except in India, where the\nstrain buffalopox infects buffaloes, and in Brazil, where the strain\nCantagalo (Cantagalo virus) infects dairy cows (2,42-44). In any case,\nall 3 orthopoxviruses cause zoonotic infections, and individuals\nacquire the infection when handling infected animals figures 2 and 3\n(2,22,37,40,45,46)\" \"The history and evolutionary relationships of the different smallpox\nvaccine strains remain obscure, because most strains and clonal\nvariants have not yet been completely sequenced. Historical and\nscientific evidence suggests that the Beaugency lymph lymph passed in\ncows by Chambon and Lanoix and, in October, 1866, they mixed this\nmaterial with lymph obtained from a 2nd natural case of cowpox\ndiscovered in Saint-Mandé, in the suburbs of Paris. The mixture was\nreferred to as the Beaugency lymph and was used subsequently by the\nAnimal Vaccine Institute as a seed to produce the vaccine\n(20,48,72,74) and horsepox virus made a strong contribution to the\ngenetic makeup of the existing vaccine strains, particularly those\nfrom continental Europe, USA, and Brazil. Evidence also suggests that\nthe Beaugency lymph was probably a vaccinia virus strain or a close\nancestor related to horsepox virus, and not a cowpox strain. Thus, it\nis reasonable to believe not only that cowpox virus was not used as a\nsmallpox vaccine in the 19th century, but that it might have never\nbeen used at all. Assumptions about the origins of the Beaugency lymph\nalso indicate that vaccinia virus was once a circulating virus in\nanimals in Europe in the 19th century, but later it disappeared and\nnow has no natural hosts, except in Brazil, India, and perhaps in\nEgypt, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal. Many questions still persist,\nand analysis of full-genome sequences of ancient vaccine strains would\nhelp unravel this fascinating medical mystery.\" - Mod.LL A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at:\n(http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106).

(promed@promedmail.org)  \"Infection with Brucella in sheep and goats (excluding _B. ovis_ infection) is primarily caused by one of the 3 biovars of _B. melitensis_. Sporadic infections caused by _B. abortus_ or _B. suis_ have been observed in sheep and goats, but such cases are extremely rare. Infection with Brucella in sheep and goats is endemic in the Mediterranean region, but infection is widespread worldwide. North America (except Mexico) is believed to be free from the agent, as are northern and central Europe, southeast Asia, Australia and New Zealand.  Pathologically and epidemiologically, _B. melitensis_ infection in sheep and goats is very similar to _B. abortus_ infection in cattle. In most circumstances, the primary routes of transmission of Brucella are the placenta, fetal fluids and vaginal discharges expelled by infected ewes and goats when they abort or have full-term parturition. Shedding of Brucella is also common in udder secretions and semen, and Brucella may be isolated from various tissues, such as lymph nodes from the head, spleen and organs associated with reproduction (uterus, epididymides and testes), and from arthritic lesions\" (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.04_BRUCELLOSIS.pdf).  \"_B. melitensis_ is highly pathogenic for humans; this organism is considered to be the most severe human pathogen in the genus. Occupational exposure is seen in laboratory workers, farmers, veterinarians and others who contact infected animals or tissues. Brucellosis is one of the most easily acquired laboratory infections. People who do not work with animals or tissues usually become infected by ingesting unpasteurized dairy products. The Rev-1 B. melitensis vaccine is also pathogenic for humans and must be handled with caution to avoid accidental injection or contamination of mucous membranes or abraded skin\" (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/brucellosis_melitensis.pdf). - Mod.CRD  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/81).

Date: Wed 6 Sep 2017. From: EpiCore Global Surveillance Project (edited)   ProMED circulated a request for further information through the Epi-Core network, and this is a summary of the various responses we received:  Reconstruction of the history 1. Prior to onset of illness, the family was staying at Bibione, Province of Venice (seaside resort) and on 13 Aug 2017, the girl was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus at the Portogruaro hospital (40 km approx 28 mi north of Venice). 2. The family including the girl returned to Trento where they live on 16 Aug 2017 and she was admitted to the hospital for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. She was discharged on 21 Aug 2017. 3. On 16 Aug 2017, 2 children from Burkina Faso with falciparum malaria were admitted to the same children's ward in Trento hospital. 4. Fever was reported in the girl on 28 Aug 2017, the fever then disappeared but returned on 30 Aug 2017 when she was again hospitalized at Trento hospital. Malaria was diagnosed and treatment was started. On 2 Sep 2017 she was air-lifted to the University Hospital in Brescia with a diagnosis of cerebral malaria.   \n<br><br>Communicated by: EpiCore Global Surveillance Project (promed@promedmail.org)  ProMED-mail would like to thank all of the EpiCore members who responded to the request for more information on this event.   The overlap with the 2 cases from Burkina Faso was 5 days and thus infection would have had to have beeen through direct transmission by blood and not through mosquitoes. If the needle used for blood sugar testing in some manner was shared between the known malaria patients and the young girl who had been hospitalized for diabetes, then nosocomial transmission is a possibility.  An alternative possibility is that the infection occurred from local Italian mosquitoes that had been infected by an asymptomatic gametocyte carrier. This is well known to happen and malaria was endemic in northern Italy in the past especially in the period between both world wars when there was a high prevalence of the disease, but it was _P.vivax_ and not _P. falciparum_. Whether the local mosquitoes (_A. maculipennis_ complex) are capable of transmitting _P. falciparum_ malaria is not known, but the possibility is not excluded.  )From infection to the debut of symptoms, the incubation period is usually 7 - 10 days in non-immune individuals. If the hospitalization for the suspected diabetes mellitus in Portogruaro hospital was in fact when she presented with the 1st symptoms of malaria, then she was most likely infected 7 - 10 days previously, however, fever would have been a key presenting symptom.  Thus the key question is when did the 1st symptoms of malaria actually appear  and the only certain point in the information we presently have is that she was febrile on 28 Aug 2017.  There is a huge variability from the time the symptoms started to the time of death in imported (non-immune) malaria cases. A large study of 22 fatal outcomes of patient with _P. falciparum_ malaria returning to Switzerland (Christen et al. Am J Trop Med Hyg 2006;75:1188-94) reported an average of 8 days with a low of 3 days. Thus if the 1st symptoms of malaria were on 28 Aug 2017, the date of actual infection must have taken place within the 10 prior days.  Does the climate allow development of the malaria parasite in the mosquito? The average temperature for Trento in August 2017 is found here: (https://www.accuweather.com/en/it/trento/216357/august-weather/216357). The average night temperature is only reaching 20 C (approx. 68 F) on 18 Aug 2017, otherwise it was well below 20 C (approx. 68 F) with a low of 13 C (approx. 55 F). In order to allow _P.falciparum_ to develop in mosquitoes, the average night temperature must be 20 C (approx. 68 F) or more for 8 - 10 days. Thus the temperature in Trento in August 2017 excludes the possibility the 2 patients from Burkina Faso infected local mosquitoes, which then infected the patient.  The average temperature for Bibione in August 2017 is found here: (https://www.accuweather.com/en/it/bibione/2550920/august-weather/2550920). )From 1 Aug 2017 to 20 Aug 2017 the average night temperature was above 20 C approx. 68 F except for 2 days (12 and 13 Aug 2017) and thus the _P. falciparum_ parasite had the climatic conditions to develop in the mosquito if local mosquitoes are able to transmit _p. falciparum_ and were infected by a gametocyte carrier.  The risk of reintroducing malaria in Italy was discussed in Romi et al. in 2012 (Romi R et al. Probable autochthonous introduced malaria cases in Italy in 2009-2011 and the risk of local vector-borne transmission. Euro Surveill. 2012 Nov 29;17(48). pii: 20325). In Trento (Province of Trentino) the _Anopheles_ species in _A. maculipennis_ complex is present which is regarded as zoophilic (not preferring humans).  In conclusion, it is a possibility that the girl was infected by mosquitoes during her stay in Bibione, but nosocomial infection in Trento is an alternative explanation. - Mod.EP  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/75).

Dr Mazoya on\nThu 24 Aug 2017 said they had put all medical facilities in the 7\nsub-counties of Kilifi on high alert. Hospitals and dispensaries have been asked to watch out for cholera\nsymptoms and educate patients on measures to stop the spread of the\ndisease. Dr Mazoya said a team of public health officers had been\ndispatched to treat the 5 patients at Kiwandani Village and keep watch\non the disease. \"We have set up a cholera treatment centre at\nKiwandani Dispensary to manage the identified cases and any other\nsubsequent cases from the locality,\" he said. Dr Mazoya said the 5\nyear old child who died as a result of acute diarrhea and vomiting did\nnot test positive for cholera. \"The child had been admitted to a private health institution but soon\nafter the death, 5 of the family members who came into contact with\nthe child later tested positive of cholera and admitted to the\nKiwandani Dispensary,\" said Dr Mazoya.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness\nand disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE,\nAtay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral\nrehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and\nother forms of diarrhea: \"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that\ncholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement,\nand, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not\nuntil 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of\nthe intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could\nbe effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the\nintravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could\nbe just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for\nexample, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy\n(ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the\nmorbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1)\nhighlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn\nBangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per\ncent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as\n\"potentially the most important medical advance\" of the 20th century.\nA variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice\npowder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially\nzinc (5). \"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to\napproximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those\nwith severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously\nwith a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of\n20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg\nover the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser\ndegrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or\nrice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those\nwith no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with\nfrequent reevaluation. \"References\n-\n1.

Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:\n- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam;\n- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however,\nhave suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be\neffective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and\noutbreak situations (63, 64). \"References\n\n57.

Another finding of concern is that DEN-4 strain,\nresembling the one detected in Pune in 2009, was detected in as many\nas 11 samples. DEN-4 is associated with unusual symptoms like\nrespiratory distress, pleural effusion, and elevated levels of liver\nenzymes.

This came about after 2\nkidney recipients in Taiwan were diagnosed with dengue 2 days after\nreceiving a kidney each from the same donor, said National Cheng Kung\nUniversity microbiology and immunology professor Dr Oscar Perng\nGuey-chuen. \"This indicates a potential risk,\" the Taiwan-based\nscientist said, adding that no dengue virus was detected in the\ndonor's blood. He said the donor contracted dengue in 2015 and in mid-2016, he died\nin an accident. His family donated his corneas, liver, heart, and\nkidneys. Both patients had the same strain of the dengue virus the\ndonor had in 2015 and one of the recipients died of dengue\nhaemorrhagic fever, he said. Asked where the virus could be hiding since it could not be detected\nin the blood, he said it was a question scientists are trying to\nanswer. Interestingly, those who received the donor's corneas, liver,\nand heart did not develop dengue, Dr Perng said on the sidelines of\nthe National Dengue And Arboviruses Infection Conference 2017\nyesterday 12 Aug 2017. He said although there was not enough\nevidence to show the virus came from the donor as the kidneys were not\ntested for dengue before the transplant, the same virus was found in\nthe patients' bodies after that. Dr Perng said his team had studied mice for dengue virus in the blood\ntestes, kidney, liver, spleen and brain, and found the virus present\nin the kidneys and brain. \"We believe the virus probably resided in\nthe kidneys and was not cleared by the body,\" he said, adding that the\nvirus could have been activated after transplant. He said this raised\nconcerns about asymptomatic people who are dengue carriers. Health Ministry deputy director, general Datuk Dr S Jeyaindran said\npatients with severe dengue would have better recovery if they were\ngiven colloids, a more concentrated fluid, at the early stage in fluid\nmanagement for dengue patients. Dr Jeyaindran, who was representing\nHealth Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam, said colloids may be\nintroduced at an earlier stage, instead of saline because it has not\nbeen successful in treating patients with severe dengue. He said more\nstudies will be conducted to find out at which stage the colloids\nshould be given. byline: Loh Foon Fong \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) - Air travel related spread of dengue.\nDate: Thu 3 Aug 2017.\nSource: Medical Xpress (edited)\n(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-08-air-responsible-dengue-asia.html) \nWhile the incidences of many other infectious diseases have declined\nover the past decade, the number of cases and outbreaks of dengue\nvirus have continued to increase. The spread of dengue to new areas is\nlikely due in large part to trends in air travel, researchers now\nreport in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Dengue virus affects as estimated 390 million people around the globe\neach year, and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild fever and\nheadache to severe low blood pressure. The virus has mostly caused\ndisease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, but a 2014\noutbreak in Japan broke that pattern. Overall, the geographic area\naffected by dengue has been growing in recent years. In the new work, Huaiyu Tian and Bing Xu, both of Beijing Normal\nUniversity, China, together with colleagues from the University of\nOxford and elsewhere analyzed the spread of dengue viruses in Asia\nfrom 1956 to 2015. They used 2202 genetic sequences of dengue viruses,\ncollected in 20 countries or regions of Asia over the 59 years, to\ndetermine how different strains were related. They also investigated\ntrends in air travel, maritime mobility, migration, and\nsocio-economics to determine what factors impact the spread of\ndengue. The spread of 3 different dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1, -2, and -3,\nis associated with air traffic more so than any other factors, the\ndata revealed. Air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India, the\nresearchers found, help seed dengue epidemics, while China, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, and Singapore help diffuse the virus to other Asian\ncountries. \"Future trends in global mobility could potentially accelerate the\nappearance and diffusion of DENV worldwide,\" the researchers say.\n\"Prevention and control of dengue epidemics requires a better\nunderstanding of its mode of geographic dissemination, especially for\ncountries in the tropics.\" Reference: Tian H, Sun Z, Faria NR, et al.

Growers should be aware of the higher risks of barley yellow\ndwarf virus (BYDV) infection in crops sown this autumn 2017 and were\nadvised by Hutchinsons' Crop Consultants Cam Murray to make every\neffort to mitigate the possible impacts. He said that pressure in several areas of Scotland had been\n\"excessive\" after large flights of aphids through spring, with classic\nyellowing symptoms found in spring oats, barley, and wheat. \"This\nmeans that early-sown winter barley crops will be at particularly high\nrisk this autumn,\" he said. The most effective way to protect early\ngrowth was to use a seed treatment and well-timed follow-up spray.

Man­itoba Agriculture's Holly Derksen said, \"I think this is\nprobably the most severe that I've seen it.\" It is unclear if there\nare other, unreported, cases. The virus also may take root in its\nnamesake barley or other cereals like wheat. \"It does seem like this year 2017 there are some bigger patches and\nwhen it is a severely infected plant you will not have seed\nproduction,\" she said. \"It really depends on the incidence in the\nfield, but if there are big patches that are affected, there could be\nsome significant yield loss.\" Byline: Alexis Stockford \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) Barley yellow dwarf (BYD) disease occurs worldwide and affects a wide\nrange of grass species (Gramineae) including cereal crops like barley,\nwheat, oats, rice, maize, and rye. It is the most destructive of the\nvirus diseases for wheat. Grain yields may be reduced by 1/3. Symptoms\ninclude leaf discolouration from yellow to purple (depending on the\nhost species), stunting, reduced tillering, and empty seed heads.\nPlants infected in autumn may not survive the winter or show severe\nsymptoms when growth resumes. Diseased plants often occur in circular\npatches within a field, which are associated with colonisation by the\naphid vectors. BYD viruses have now been split into several species in the family\nLuteoviridae (mostly in the genus _Luteovirus_). They are\ndifferentiated by their ability to be transmitted by various aphid\nspecies (family Aphididae) and their virulence on a selected variety\nof oats. Some of the viruses are transmitted equally well by several\naphids, whereas others can be transmitted by only one or 2 species.\nThe bird cherry(-oat) aphid (_Rhopalosiphum padi_) and grain (wheat)\naphid (_Sitobion avenae_) are vectors of the severe _Barley yellow\ndwarf virus-PAV_ (type member of genus _Luteovirus_). Coinfections of\nseveral BYD viruses may occur in one plant, which can result in either\nmore severe (synergistic) or milder (due to cross protection)\nsymptoms, depending on the virus partners. The viruses cannot be transmitted by seed, pollen, or mechanical means\nand cannot survive in stubble or in the soil. Volunteer cereal plants\nor grassy weeds may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management\nincludes use of crop cultivars with reduced sensitivity to the viruses\nand control of the aphid vectors. In Europe, a current outbreak of BYD is also being reported from\nIreland (ProMED-mail post\nhttp://promedmail.org/post/20170609.5094454).

Update: Interim guidance\nfor health care providers caring for pregnant women with possible Zika\nvirus exposure  United States (including US Territories), July 2017.\nMMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2017; 66(29): 781-93. doi:\n10.15585/mmwr.mm6629e1\n-\nCDC has updated the interim guidance for US health care providers\ncaring for pregnant women with possible Zika virus exposure in\nresponse to 1) declining prevalence of Zika virus disease in the World\nHealth Organization's Region of the Americas (Americas) and 2)\nemerging evidence indicating prolonged detection of Zika virus\nimmunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies. Zika virus cases were 1st reported\nin the Americas during 2015-2016; however, the incidence of Zika virus\ndisease has since declined. As the prevalence of Zika virus disease\ndeclines, the likelihood of false-positive test results increases. In\naddition, emerging epidemiologic and laboratory data indicate that, as\nis the case with other flaviviruses, Zika virus IgM antibodies can\npersist beyond 12 weeks after infection. Therefore, IgM test results\ncannot always reliably distinguish between an infection that occurred\nduring the current pregnancy and one that occurred before the current\npregnancy, particularly for women with possible Zika virus exposure\nbefore the current pregnancy. These limitations should be considered\nwhen counseling pregnant women about the risks and benefits of testing\nfor Zika virus infection during pregnancy. This updated guidance\nemphasizes a shared decision-making model for testing and screening\npregnant women, one in which patients and providers work together to\nmake decisions about testing and care plans based on patient\npreferences and values, clinical judgment, and a balanced assessment\nof risks and expected outcomes. For these recommendations, the definition of possible Zika virus\nexposure has not changed and includes travel to, or residence in an\narea with risk for mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission or sex with\na partner who has traveled to or resides in an area with risk for\nmosquito-borne Zika virus transmission. These areas can be found on\nthe CDC \"Zika Travel Information\" webpage. Key recommendations include the following:\n1- All pregnant women in the United States and US territories should\nbe asked about possible Zika virus exposure before and during the\ncurrent pregnancy, at every prenatal care visit. CDC recommends that\npregnant women not travel to any area with risk for Zika virus\ntransmission. It is also recommended that pregnant women with a sex\npartner who has traveled to or lives in an area with risk for Zika\nvirus transmission use condoms or abstain from sex for the duration of\nthe pregnancy.\n2- Pregnant women with recent possible Zika virus exposure and\nsymptoms of Zika virus disease should be tested to diagnose the cause\nof their symptoms. The updated recommendations include concurrent Zika\nvirus nucleic acid test (NAT) and serologic testing as soon as\npossible through 12 weeks after symptom onset.\n3- Asymptomatic pregnant women with ongoing possible Zika virus\nexposure should be offered Zika virus NAT testing 3 times during\npregnancy. IgM testing is no longer routinely recommended because IgM\ncan persist for months after infection; therefore, IgM results cannot\nreliably determine whether an infection occurred during the current\npregnancy. The optimal timing and frequency of testing of asymptomatic\npregnant women with NAT alone is unknown. For pregnant women who have\nreceived a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection (by\neither NAT or serology positive/equivocal Zika virus or dengue virus\nIgM and Zika virus plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) 10 and\nhigher and dengue virus PRNT less than 10 results) any time before or\nduring the current pregnancy, additional Zika virus testing is not\nrecommended. For pregnant women without a prior laboratory-confirmed\ndiagnosis of Zika virus, NAT testing should be offered at the\ninitiation of prenatal care, and if Zika virus RNA is not detected on\nclinical specimens, 2 additional tests should be offered during the\ncourse of the pregnancy coinciding with prenatal visits.\n4- Asymptomatic pregnant women who have recent possible Zika virus\nexposure (that is, through travel or sexual exposure) but without\nongoing possible exposure are not routinely recommended to have Zika\nvirus testing. Testing should be considered using a shared\npatient-provider decision-making model, one in which patients and\nproviders work together to make decisions about testing and care plans\nbased on patient preferences and values, clinical judgment, a balanced\nassessment of risks and expected outcomes, and the jurisdiction's\nrecommendations. Based on the epidemiology of Zika virus transmission\nand other epidemiologic considerations (such as, seasonality),\njurisdictions might recommend testing of asymptomatic pregnant women,\neither for clinical care or as part of Zika virus surveillance. With\nthe decline in the prevalence of Zika virus disease, the updated\nrecommendations for the evaluation and testing of pregnant women with\nrecent possible Zika virus exposure but without ongoing possible\nexposure are now the same for all areas with any risk for Zika virus\ntransmission.\n5- Pregnant women who have recent possible Zika virus exposure and who\nhave a fetus with prenatal ultrasound findings consistent with\ncongenital Zika virus syndrome should receive Zika virus testing to\nassist in establishing the etiology of the birth defects. Testing\nshould include both NAT and IgM tests.\n6- The comprehensive approach to testing placental and fetal tissues\nhas been updated. Testing placental and fetal tissue specimens can be\nperformed for diagnostic purposes in certain scenarios (e.g., women\nwithout a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection and\nwho have a fetus or infant with possible Zika virus-associated birth\ndefects). However, testing of placental tissues for Zika virus\ninfection is not routinely recommended for asymptomatic pregnant women\nwho have recent possible Zika virus exposure but without ongoing\npossible exposure and who have a live born infant without evidence of\npossible Zika virus-associated birth defects.\n7- Zika virus IgM testing as part of preconception counseling to\nestablish baseline IgM results for non pregnant women with ongoing\npossible Zika virus exposure is not warranted because Zika virus IgM\ntesting is no longer routinely recommended for asymptomatic pregnant\nwomen with ongoing possible Zika virus exposure. also at the source URL above:\nAdditional interim guidance:\n- Laboratory testing of pregnant women with exposure to areas with\nrisk for Zika virus transmission\n- Prenatal management of pregnant women with laboratory evidence of\npossible Zika virus infection\n- Evaluation of placental and fetal tissue specimens for Zika virus\ninfection \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org)\nand\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be)(promed@promedmail.org) Readers interested in accessing the full report can find it at the\nsource URL above.

To evaluate the rates of acute ZIKV infection among\npatients hospitalized with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS),\nmeningoencephalitis, or transverse myelitis.\nDesign, setting, and participants. A prospective, observational cohort\nstudy was conducted at a tertiary referral center for neurological\ndiseases in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between 5 Dec 2015-10 May 2016,\namong consecutive hospitalized adults (older than 18 years of age)\nwith new-onset acute parainfectious or neuroinflammatory disease. All\nparticipants were tested for a series of arbovirosis. 3-month\nfunctional outcome was assessed.\nInterventions. Samples of serum and cerebrospinal fluid were tested\nfor ZIKV using real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain\nreaction and an IgM antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent\nassay. Clinical, radiographic (magnetic resonance imaging),\nelectrophysiological, and 3-month functional outcome data were\ncollected.\nMain outcomes and measures. The detection of neurologic complications\nsecondary to ZIKV infection.\nResults. 40 patients (15 women and 25 men; median age, 44 years\nrange, 22-72 years) were enrolled, including 29 patients (73\npercent) with GBS (90 percent Brighton level 1 certainty), 7 (18\npercent) with encephalitis, 3 (8 percent) with transverse myelitis,\nand 1 (3 percent) with newly diagnosed chronic inflammatory\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy. Of these, 35 patients (88 percent) had\nmolecular and/or serologic evidence of recent ZIKV infection in the\nserum and/or cerebrospinal fluid. Of the patients positive for ZIKV\ninfection, 27 had GBS (18 demyelinating, 8 axonal, and 1 Miller Fisher\nsyndrome), 5 had encephalitis (3 with concomitant acute neuromuscular\ndisease), 2 had transverse myelitis, and 1 had chronic inflammatory\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy. Admission to the intensive care unit was\nrequired for 9 patients positive for ZIKV infection (26 percent), and\n5 (14 percent) required mechanical ventilation. Compared with\nadmission during the period from 5 Dec 2013 - 10 May 2014 (before the\nBrazilian outbreak of ZIKV), admissions for GBS increased from a mean\nof 1.0 per month to 5.6 per month, admissions for encephalitis\nincreased from 0.4 per month to 1.4 per month, and admissions for\ntransverse myelitis remained constant at 0.6 per month. At 3 months, 2\npatients positive for ZIKV infection (6 percent) died (1 with GBS and\n1 with encephalitis), 18 (51 percent) had chronic pain, and the median\nmodified Rankin score among survivors was 2 (range, 0-5).\nConclusions and relevance. In this single-center Brazilian cohort,\nZIKV infection was associated with an increase in the incidence of a\ndiverse spectrum of serious neurologic syndromes. The data also\nsuggest that serologic and molecular testing using blood and\ncerebrospinal fluid samples can serve as a less expensive, alternative\ndiagnostic strategy in developing countries, where plaque reduction\nneutralization testing is impractical. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) This study illustrates the need to consider post-Zika virus infection\nas a cause of a variety of neurological diseases.

PLoS\nPathog. 2017; 13(8): e1006487. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006487\n-\nAbstract\n\nStudies have demonstrated cross-reactivity of anti-dengue virus (DENV)\nantibodies in human sera against Zika virus (ZIKV), promoting\nincreased ZIKV infection in vitro. However, the correlation between in\nvitro and in vivo findings is not well characterized. Thus, we\nevaluated the impact of heterotypic flavivirus immunity on ZIKV titers\nin biofluids of rhesus macaques. Animals previously infected (420 days\nor longer) with DENV2, DENV4, or yellow fever virus were compared to\nflavivirus-naïve animals following infection with a Brazilian ZIKV\nstrain. Sera from DENV-immune macaques demonstrated cross-reactivity\nwith ZIKV by antibody-binding and neutralization assays prior to ZIKV\ninfection, and promoted increased ZIKV infection in cell culture\nassays. Despite these findings, no significant differences between\nflavivirus-naïve and immune animals were observed in viral titers,\nneutralizing antibody levels, or immune cell kinetics following ZIKV\ninfection. These results indicate that prior infection with\nheterologous flaviviruses neither conferred protection nor increased\nobserved ZIKV titers in this non-human primate ZIKV infection model. Author summary\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne, emerging flavivirus. In\naddition to asymptomatic or mild febrile manifestations, ZIKV\ninfection in humans is associated with comparatively rare congenital\nand neurological abnormalities. Previous in vitro studies have\ndemonstrated cross-reactivity of antibodies derived from dengue virus\ninfections with ZIKV, as well as antibody-mediated enhancement of\ninfection in cell culture. Therefore, there is concern among\nvaccinologists and the public health community that the more severe\ndisease manifestations could result from prior immunity, either from\nnatural infection or vaccination, to antigenically-related\nflaviviruses (such as, dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis).\nIn this study, we evaluated the impact of prior immunity to dengue or\nyellow fever virus on ZIKV infection in a non-human primate model.\nAfter confirming that our immune cohorts were capable of\nrecapitulating the published in vitro observations of cross-reactivity\nand enhancement, we looked for alteration of viral titers in\nperipheral blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, and vaginal\nsecretions, as well as alterations in gross pathology, clinical\nparameters, and immune response, as compared to our flavivirus-naïve\ncohort. Importantly, no significant differences between\nflavivirus-naïve and primed animals were observed in viral titers or\nbiofluid distribution, neutralizing antibody levels, or immune cell\nkinetics following ZIKV infection. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org)\nand\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be)(promed@promedmail.org) Previous dengue infection, whether acquired naturally or antibody\nelicited by vaccines, has been a concern due to the possibility of\nantibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) with more severe disease. This\nconcern also relates to Zika virus antibody from vaccination for\nenhancement of dengue virus infections with resulting more severe\ndisease. The monkey studies reported above indicated that this may not\nbe a problem for Zika virus vaccinated individuals.

ZIKV is also transmitted by\nsexual contact, although the relative importance of sexual\ntransmission is unclear. To better understand the role of sexual\ntransmission in ZIKV pathogenesis, a nonhuman primate (NHP) model of\nvaginal transmission was developed. ZIKV was readily transmitted to\nmature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by vaginal inoculation was\nreadily transmitted to mature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by\nvaginal individual RM with 1-5 vaginal inoculations required to\nestablish infection. After treatment with Depoprovera, a widely used\ncontraceptive progestin, 2 RM that initially resisted 8 vaginal ZIKV\ninoculations became infected after one ZIKV inoculation. Thus,\nDepoprovera seemed to enhance susceptibility to vaginal ZIKV\ntransmission. Unexpectedly, the kinetics of virus replication and\ndissemination after intravaginal ZIKV inoculation were markedly\ndifferent from RM infected with ZIKV by subcutaneous (SQ) virus\ninoculation. Several groups have reported that after SQ ZIKV\ninoculation vRNA is rapidly detected in blood plasma with vRNA less\ncommon in urine and saliva and only rarely detected in female\nreproductive tract (FRT) secretions. In contrast, in vaginally\ninoculated RM, plasma vRNA is delayed for several days and ZIKV\nreplication in, and vRNA shedding from, the FRT was found in all 6\nanimals. Further, after intravaginal transmission ZIKV RNA shedding\nfrom FRT secretions was detected before or simultaneously with plasma\nvRNA, and persisted for at least as long. Thus, ZIKV replication in\nthe FRT was independent of, and often preceded virus replication in\nthe tissues contributing to plasma vRNA. These results support the\nconclusion that ZIKV preferentially replicates in the FRT after\nvaginal transmission, but not after SQ transmission, and raise the\npossibility that there is enhanced fetal infection and pathology after\nvaginal ZIKV transmission compared to a mosquito transmitted ZIKV. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{10}</strong> _Aedes albopictus_ populations as vectors.\nDate: 2 Aug 2017.\nSource: American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (edited)\n(http://www.ajtmh.org/content/journals/10.4269/ajtmh.16-0969) \nref: Azar SR, Roundy CM, Rossi SL, et al.

Positive saliva samples were assayed for\ninfectious titer. Although all 3 mosquito populations were susceptible\nto all ZIKV strains, rates of infection, dissemination, and\ntransmission differed among mosquito and virus strains. _Aedes\nalbopictus_ from Salvador, Brazil, were the least efficient vectors,\ndemonstrating susceptibility to infection to 2 American strains of\nZIKV but failing to shed virus in saliva. Mosquitoes from the Rio\nGrande Valley were the most efficient vectors and were capable of\nshedding all 3 tested ZIKV strains into saliva after 14 days of\nextrinsic incubation. In particular, ZIKV strain DakAR 41525 (Senegal\n1954) was significantly more efficient at dissemination and saliva\ndeposition than the others tested in Rio Grande mosquitoes. Overall,\nour data indicate that, while _Ae. albopictus_ is capable of\ntransmitting ZIKV, its competence is potentially dependent on\ngeographic origin of both the mosquito population and the viral\nstrain. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) This study illustrates that fact that not all Zika virus strains and\n_Ae. albopictus_ populations are created equal in terms of efficiency\nof transmission of this virus.

Emerg Microbes\nInfect. 2017; 6(8): e69. doi: 10.1038/emi.2017.59\n-\nAbstract\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has recently been associated\nwith an increased incidence of neonatal microcephaly and other\nneurological disorders. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito\nbite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some\ncases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main\nvector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other\nmosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the\nvirus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit\nZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of\nlaboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_.\nInterestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the\nmidgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in\nRecife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially\nfed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced.\nCollectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range\nof ZIKV vectors than anticipated. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be) Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active\nvirus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their\nability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step\ntoward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_\nfed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in\nsaliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing.\nThe study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a\ncompetent vector. Several other studies have shown this species to be\ninefficient vectors or refractory to Zika virus infection. One wonders\nif the specific _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ used or the Zika virus isolates\nwith which they were tested could account for these very different\nresults. Resolving these discrepancies is important because this\nmosquito species is very widely distributed around the world and bears\ndirectly on risk of outbreaks in geographic areas where _Aedes\naegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_ , Zika virus vectors, do not occur. -\nMod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"73":{"title":"Invasive mosquito - Canada: (ON) ","date":["22","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH> Invasive mosquito - Canada: (ON) [EXTERNAL]","summary":" A ProMED-mail post (http://www.promedmail.org) ProMED-mail is a program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases (http://www.isid.org) .

Source: CBC News (edited) (http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/mosquito-responsible-for-majority-of-zika-infections-found-in-canada-for-first-time-1.4257135)   An adult _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, the species responsible for the majority of human Zika virus cases, has been found in Canada for the 1st time. Evidence shows mosquitoes capable of carrying Zika virus may have a colony in Ontario.  Staff from the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit recently found the insect in a trap, a discovery health officials believe signals the species is becoming established in southern Ontario. \"It was just in such good shape, we are absolutely 100 per cent sure of what species it is,\" said Fiona Hunter, from Brock University, who heads up the lab that tested Windsor's mosquitoes. \"It didn't just blow in from the (United) States.\"  Last week week ending 20 Aug 2017, the health unit revealed 2 _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes, also known as the Asian tiger mosquito, had also been found in the area. \"Once they establish themselves here it would be more difficult to control and maybe we'll see some diseases we haven't seen before,\" said Dr Wajid Ahmed, the region's acting medical officer of health, at the time.  Having the Asian tiger mosquito show up in Canada was a bit of a surprise, considering it wasn't expected to migrate north for at least another decade, Hunter explained. But the odds of it arriving is still higher than the latest species. \"The Asian tiger mosquito is known to exist farther north in the (United) States .. but _Aedes aegypti_ is supposed to be sub-tropical and tropical - Mod.TY, so what on earth is it doing here?\"  All aedes mosquitoes found in Windsor-Essex so far have tested negative for both the Zika and West Nile virus. Given there are no active cases of the diseases, there's less cause for alarm, according to Hunter. \"I think it's alarming  for the country  that our climate is changing,\" she said. \"In the last decade we've added another 10 mosquito species to our endemic list .. so we know something is going on.\"   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  Although finding _Aedes aegypti_ in southern Canada is a surprise, one should remember that this tropical and sub-tropical species became seasonally established along the east coast of the USA and was responsible for yellow fever outbreaks in northern cities such as Philadelphia more than 200 years ago. However, it will not become established in Canada for the same reason it has not become established in the north central and north east states of the USA.  However, _Aedes albopictus_ distribution is another matter. This species has been extending its known range northward and recently has been found in Nebraska, Connecticut, Indiana, Ohio, Minnesota and Wisconsin, 3 of which border Ontario across the Great Lakes . Unlike _A. aegypti_, _A. albopictus_ eggs can go into diapause and withstand freezing winter temperatures. A University of Wisconsin-Madison entomologist Susan Paskewitz points out that viable populations of this species have not yet become established in these northern states and it seems unlikely that they will in Ontario either. However, continued surveillance for both is prudent. - Mod.TY  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/260).

Five districts in 3 governorates are now infected.  The total number of cVDPV2 cases is 33 (this includes the previously reported 29 cases from Mayadeen district, Deir ez-Zor governorate, and 1 case from Tell Abyad district, Raqqa governorate). All confirmed cases to date have had onset of paralysis before 11 Jul 2017.  Final lab results for an additional 9 poliovirus type-2 (PV2) isolates from Deir ez-Zor are pending.  Discussions around expanding the scope of the immunization response to include accessible areas of a Tadmour sub-district in Homs, bordering Deir ez-Zor , will be held in light of the confirmation of the cases in this area.  Raqqa governorate commenced its 1st immunization round on 12 Aug 2017 (Raqqa and Thawra districts) and 13 Aug 2017 (Tell Abyad district). The immunization round aims to reach 120 000 children under 5 years of age. Preliminary information suggests the rounds are reaching children in all 3 districts.  Preparations continue for the 2nd round in Deir ez-Zor governorate, scheduled for 19-23 Aug 2017. IPV inactivated polio vaccine for use in the 2nd rounds in Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa governorates has arrived in Damascus.  The total number of AFP acute flaccid paralysis cases detected in Deir ez-Zor governorate since the beginning of 2017 is 113 (83 from Mayadeen, 11 from Deir ez-Zor, and 19 from Boukamal districts). Raqqa governorate has reported 16 AFP cases (5 from Raqqa, 10 from Tell Abyad, and 1 from Thawra districts). Homs governorate has reported 26 AFP cases (11 from Homs city, 12 from Rastan, 1 from Tadmour, and 2 from Talkalakh districts).  The Eradication and Outbreak Management Group (EOMG) has approved the release of additional doses of IPV to cover high risk population groups in northwest Syria, Turkey, and Lebanon. Lebanon requested 144 000 doses and has begun to implement IPV campaigns across the country.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Unfortunately transmission of the cVDPV2 in Syria has continued. With each report, the date of onset of the most recent case shifts to a date approximately one month preceding the report, probably reflecting the time it takes from specimen collection to appropriate reference laboratory. We are fairly sure there will be an additional 9 cases confirmed from Deir ez-Zor, as the report above mentions that there are 9 poliovirus isolates pending typing (WPV vs cVDPV). The report also mentions a significant number of AFP cases identified in the 3 governorates, suggesting there may be more cases in the pipeline for confirmation. The control activities have been implemented during this week and will be implemented in additional areas next week week of 21 Aug 2017, so hopefully there will be interruption of transmission going forward.  The disturbing news in the situation report above, is that there is now involvement of 3 governorates. Deir ez-Zor, Raqqa, and now Homs. On a map of Syria showing provinces/governorates ((http://www.freeworldmaps.net/asia/syria/syria-political-map.jpg)), one can see that Deir ez-Zor, the main governorate involved in this outbreak is located in the northeast of the country sharing it's eastern border with Iraq. It shares a southern border with Homs, and a western border with Raqqa (Ar-Raqqah on this map) governorate. Hopefully the cVDPV2 will not continue to travel in the country outside of the currently 3 affected areas. - Mod.MPP   <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Somalia: declared polio free. Date: Mon 14 Aug 2017. Source: AllAfrica, Shabelle Media Network (Mogadishu) report (edited) (http://allafrica.com/stories/201708150227.html)   The UN World Health Organisation (WHO) said it had not recorded any case of polio disease in Somalia in the last 3 years, declaring the country polio free.  The WHO said the country recorded the last case of polio in 2014 in the central part of the country but has since then remained free of the paralyzing disease.  The UN health agency, however, warned Somalia remained vulnerable, calling for continued vaccination campaign, Xinhua News Agency reported.  The head of the WHO Eastern Mediterranean, which covers Somalia, Mohamed Fiqi said that massive vaccination campaigns and commitment from government and international actors had ensured the polio virus did not recur in the Horn of Africa country.  \"As the world edges closer to eradicating polio, keeping alert in countries that have high risk of polio importation like Somalia is more of priority than ever,\" Fiqi said.  \"As we move forward, the polio programme in Somalia needs to continue to work to maintain and improve the level of population immunity against polio through target vaccination campaign and strengthening of the routine immunisation services and infrastructure,\" Fiqi added.  The declaration by WHO keeps Somalia outside the last group of countries which still record cases of polio in the world.  Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan are the remaining countries where polio is still being recorded. The WHO chief warned Somalia remains at risk of importation of the virus from these countries.  Somalia President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo praised efforts to rid his country of the polio disease which he noted had subjected many children into suffering.  \"No cases were found for the past 3 years and no child was affected by this disease. Many of our children have suffered from polio for many years.  \"To eradicate polio was a big success and it was collective effort and commitment by many young men and women who sacrificed their lives,\" Farmaajo noted.  The 3 year polio-free celebration comes amidst the worst outbreak of measles the country has seen in years.  Somalia is also still responding to an outbreak of acute watery diarrhoea/cholera, which began in January 2017. Polio systems and networks are being used in both interventions.  \"Polio infrastructure has been critical in responding to these other serious outbreaks,\" said Fiqi.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  Achieving 3 years with no new cases of polio reported is a significant achievement for Somalia. That being said, it's important to remember that this too is a country with internal civil strife and warring factions, which may impede the identification of poliovirus associated disease either due to infrastructural challenges in good specimen collection and transport, or access of the population to the healthcare infrastructure. A reminder is the identification of WPV associated cases in Borno, Nigeria last year (2016), involving a virus last seen 5 years before in the same state.

The Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and recommended the extension of revised Temporary Recommendations for a further 3 months. The key change is the inclusion of DR Congo and Syria in the category 'States infected with cVDPV2s, with potential risk of international spread'.  - Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: Afghanistan: 1 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case; Pakistan: 1 new WPV1-positive environmental sample; Syrian Arab Republic: 3 new circulating vaccine-derived polio type 2 (cVDPV2) from Syria, 2 from Deir ez-Zor and 1 from Homs governorates. Details in country-specific sections below.  Afghanistan  - One new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week, bringing the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 to 6. It is the most recent case in the country, and had onset of paralysis on 10 Jul 2017, from Zabul province, neighbouring Kandahar province and Pakistan. - Afghanistan continues to coordinate activities with neighbouring Pakistan, to address both cross-border transmission and focus on reaching mobile populations with oral polio vaccine (OPV). Transmission linking both countries runs primarily across 3 corridors, namely: eastern Afghanistan and Khyber-Peshawar, Pakistan; greater Kandahar/Helmand and Quetta, Pakistan; and, Paktika/Patkya/Khost and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa/Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Pakistan.  Pakistan  - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week; the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 3. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 11 Jun 2017, from Killa Abdullah, Balochistan. - 1 new WPV1-positive environmental sample was reported in the past week, collected on 28 Jul 2017, from Quetta, Balochistan. - A special vaccination round is being implemented during August 2017 targeting areas with recent polio cases and positive environmental samples. These include Rawalpindi/Islamabad and demographically connected areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Quetta Block, and parts of Karachi. - Under the National Emergency Action Plan for polio eradication, the country is planning to implement 2 nation-wide and 2 sub-national vaccination rounds from September to December 2017.  Nigeria - - No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 21 Aug 2016 in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno. - Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016). - Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance.  Lake Chad Basin  - The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno, Nigeria in 2016) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) (Borno and Sokoto provinces in Nigeria in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak. - Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.  Central Africa  - No new cases of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). The total number of cVDPV2 cases this year 2017 remains 7, in 2 separate outbreaks: in Haut Lomami province (5 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on 13 Jun 2017); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on 26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017, with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May 2017). - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time. Outbreak response is taking place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols, targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 across the 2 provinces. - The 1st mOPV2 round was implemented on 27-29 Jun 2017 in the 2 affected provinces; and the 2nd mOPV2 round ran from 13-15 Jul 2017 in Haut Lomami and 20-22 Jul 2017 in Maniema. - Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.  Middle East  - In Syria, 3 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were officially reported in the past week. The total number of cases in this outbreak is 33. Onset of paralysis of these cases is between 3 Mar 2017 and 10 Jul 2017. 31 of the cases are from Deir ez-Zor governorate (29 from Mayadeen district, one from Deir ez-Zor district, and one from Boukamal district); 1 case is from Talabyad district, Raqqa governorate; and, 1 is from Tadmour district in Homs governorate. - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized and implemented, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Two vaccination campaigns are planned for both Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa governorates. If there is geographic spread, the extent of these campaigns will have to be adjusted. - The 1st mOPV2 round in Deir ez-Zor was successfully carried out between 22-26 Jul 2017. Independent post-campaign monitoring reflected coverage of 88.4 percent (based on caregiver recall). The 2nd round is planned for 19-23 Aug 2017, and will include mOPV2 and IPV. - Raqqa Governorate started mOPV2 campaigns on 12 Aug 2017. - Plans are being finalized to mitigate the risks of further spread from the outbreak zone to neighbouring areas and countries, including immunization of at-risk populations in northwest Syria, Turkey and Lebanon. Following confirmation of the case in Homs, discussions are ongoing to further extend the geographic reach of the outbreak response.

(promed@promedmail.org)  This week's global update is similar to prior weeks in terms of low level identification of WPV1 associated disease (a single case confirmed in Afghanistan this past week), one positive WPV1 isolated from an environmental sample in Pakistan, and 3 newly confirmed cVDPV2 associated cases in Syria.  That being said, there have only been 9 confirmed cases of WPV1 associated paralytic disease worldwide this year (2017), compared with 37 cases reported last year (2016). In contrast there have been 40 confirmed cases of cVDPV2 confirmed this year (2017) compared with 5 last year (2016). As a reminder, outbreaks due to cVDPV's are considered as significant in the big picture of polio eradication, as they are due to vaccine polioviruses that have reverted in neurovirulence following passage through multiple individuals while circulating in the susceptible population. The goal of the polio eradication initiative is to interrupt transmission of both the WPV's and the cVDPVs. The presence of cVDPVs occurs when there are areas with low vaccination coverage where the vaccine virus (from the OPV) can continue circulating through the susceptible population.

The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 11 Jun 2017, from Killa Abdullah, Balochistan. - Two new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) environmental positive samples were reported in the past week, from Karachi, Sindh (collected on 7 and 12 Aug 2017). - Additionally, pre-notification was received this week of a new WPV1 case from Karachi, Pakistan. The case will be officially reflected in next week's global data reporting. Karachi had previously been a key reservoir for WPV1 in Pakistan. Analysis is ongoing to determine the origin of this latest case and a response is being planned. The case had onset of paralysis on 11 Aug 2017. The last previous case from Karachi is from January 2016. - The National Task Force for Polio Eradication convened last week, chaired by the Prime Minister of Pakistan and attended by the senior leadership from the national and provincial levels. The Task force reviewed the revised National Emergency Action Plan 2017/18 and discussed mechanisms of accelerating the implementation of strategies to stop WPV1 transmission in the key hot spots. - Under the National Emergency Action Plan for polio eradication, the country is planning to implement 2 nation-wide and 2 sub-national vaccination rounds from September to December 2017.  Nigeria - - No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 21 Aug 2016 in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno. - Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and cVDPV2 strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016). - Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance.  Lake Chad Basin  - The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno, Nigeria in 2016) and cVDPV2 (Borno and Sokoto provinces in Nigeria in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak. - Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.  Central Africa  - One new case of cVDPV2 was reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), from Haut Lomami province, with onset of paralysis on 20 Jun 2017. The total number of cVDPV2 cases this year 2017 is now 8, in 2 separate outbreaks: in Haut Lomami province (6 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on 20 Jun 2017); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on 26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017, with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May 2017). - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time. Outbreak response is taking place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols, targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 across the 2 provinces. \n- The 1st mOPV2 round was implemented on 27-29 Jun 2017 in the 2 affected provinces; and the 2nd mOPV2 round ran from 13-15 Jul 2017 in Haut Lomami and 20-22 Jul 2017 in Maniema. - Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.  Middle East  - In Syria, 6 new cases of cVDPV2 were officially reported in the past week from Deir-Ez-Zour governorate, bringing the total number of cases in this outbreak to 39. Onset of paralysis of these cases is between 3 Mar 2017 and 10 Jul 2017. The bulk of all cases are from Deir-Ez-Zour, the epicentre of this outbreak. - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized and implemented, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Two vaccination campaigns are planned for both Deir-Ez-Zour and Raqqa governorates. - The 1st mOPV2 round in Deir-Ez-Zour was successfully carried out between 22-26 Jul 2017. Independent post-campaign monitoring reflected coverage of 88.4 percent (based on caregiver recall). - The 2nd immunization round for Deir-Ez-Zor governorate started on 22 Aug 2017 and is ongoing. Monovalent OPV2 is being provided for children between 0-59 months of age, and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) for children 2-23 months. In addition to polio vaccines, Aqua Tabs are being provided to families for water purification - 2.5 tons of water purification tablets for 400 000 people have been disseminated at health centers. - Plans are being finalized to mitigate the risks of further spread from the outbreak zone to neighbouring areas and countries, including immunization of at-risk populations in northwest Syria, Turkey and Lebanon.

All confirmed cases to date have had onset of paralysis before 14 Jul 2017. - Final lab results are pending for an additional 5 poliovirus type-2 (PV2) isolates (3 from Mayadeen and 1 from Boukamal districts, Deir Ez-Zor governorate, and 1 from Thawra district, Raqqa governorate). - The 2nd immunization round for Deir Ez-Zor started on 22 Aug 2017 and is ongoing due to high levels of population movement in and out of the governorate during the round. - WHO has organized the redistribution of vaccines and mapping of population movements to increase reach. An additional 90 000 mOPV2 doses are being transported from Damascus to Deir Ez-Zor, to cater for population influxes from As-Sukhnah, Homs governorate, and Al-Qa'im in Iraq. Corrective measures are expected to extend the round by 2 days. - Preparations for the 2nd immunization round for Raqqa are underway. - The total number of AFP cases detected in Deir Ez-Zor governorate since the beginning of 2017 is 122 (91 from Mayadeen, 10 from Deir Ez-Zor, and 21 from Boukamal districts). Raqqa governorate has reported 16 AFP cases (5 from Raqqa, 10 from Tell Abyad, and 1 from Thawra districts).

(promed@promedmail.org)  In the above global summary, there is still identified transmission ongoing in Pakistan as seen by the positive environmental sample in Karachi as well as the early report on a case of WPV1 associated disease in Karachi. It will be interesting to learn of the genetic profile of the environmental isolates in Karachi (from this past week as well as from a few weeks ago) and compare them with the newly identified WPV1 associated case in Karachi to see if they are genetically related.  There has been more activity associated with cVDPV2 in both Syria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), with 6 newly confirmed cases in Syria and 1 newly confirmed case in the DR Congo. According to the Situation Report in section <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> above, there are still 5 additional PV2 (poliovirus type 2) isolates in Syria undergoing final testing  4 from Deir al Zour and 1 from Raqqa. Hence there will probably be more cases confirmed in the coming days or weeks. I have not been able to identify similar report information from the DR Congo outbreak so it is not clear if the transmission has been interrupted leaving a total of 8 cases, or if there are still probable cases pending confirmation.

Mod.JG, edited (https://goo.gl/8k5UZP)   Last weekend, more than 20 children with severe respiratory symptoms were admitted to the Regional Hospital, and they were diagnosed with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection.  During the last week, 2 3-year-old children with severe respiratory illness were admitted to the intensive care unit, and one of them was waiting to be referred to Puerto Montt.  Therefore, with information updated until last Sat 26 Aug 2017, more than 30 children with RSV infection have been reported, and all of them are hospitalized in pediatrics, pediatric intensive care, and neonatal intensive care units. Meanwhile, because of the severity of their condition  most of them being infants  7 children have been referred to hospitals in Santiago and Concepcion so they may receive adequate care, since Coyhaique Regional Hospital (CRH) does not have a pediatric intensive care unit (ICU).  This is what Dr. Jaime Lopez-Quintana, Head of the CRH reported: \"This year 2017, RSV is behaving quite aggressively, and our adult intensive care unit is completely full with children. This is not an adequate condition for taking care of these children; this is not what our children in this region deserve,\" as he reported this situation to Ms. Gisela Alarcon-Rojas, Subsecretary of Healthcare Networks of the Chilean Ministry of Health, who verified the condition of children being taken care of in the (adult) ICU.  So, with this complex situation, Dr. Lopez-Quintana added that specialists from important children referral centers, particularly from Dr. Luis Calvo-Mackenna and Dr. Exequiel Fernandez-Cortes hospitals, will soon arrive to this region. \"We hope to have for the next 2 weeks the support of pediatricians trained in intensive medicine who may help the team we have here in Coyhaique,\" emphasized Dr. Lopez-Quintana.  According to information brought by the medical sub-direction from the Coyhaique Regional Hospital, the affected children are hospitalized in the following areas: pediatrics, neonatal intensive care unit, and (general) intensive care unit.  There are 10 infants hospitalized in the pediatrics service, while another 11 children have already been discharged; so now there are 14 beds available. In the neonatal ICU, 7 children are hospitalized; 2 of them are severely ill, and the capacity of the unit is 2 beds; while in the general ICU, 6 infants are hospitalized, and there are 2 beds available.  \"With respect to bed availability, the hospital is still able to cope with the situation. However, a working overload for the personnel has been observed, so that extra personnel have been recruited to cover the work shifts,\" explained Dr. Joaquin Garcia-Gay, Medical Subdirector of the CRH.  Also, Dr. Garcia-Gay explained that if a child develops a febrile illness, respiratory distress, intercostal retraction and malaise for 2 days, these are some of the symptoms that may indicate the presence of RSV, which mainly affects infants less than 2 years old.  \"So, if such symptoms occur, then the child must be brought to the Urgency Service. However, for those patients that develop mild respiratory symptoms, such as common cold or other similar conditions, it is preferable they are not brought to the Urgency Service, since they may be at risk for becoming infected with RSV from patients that are being hospitalized,\" the specialist advised.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  RSV is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections among young children worldwide. Most infants are infected before one year of age, and virtually everyone gets an RSV infection by 2 years of age.  Each year, on average, in the United States, RSV leads to: - 57 527 hospitalizations among children younger than 5 years old - 2.1 million outpatient visits among children younger than 5 years old - 177 000 hospitalizations and 14 000 deaths among adults older than 65 years.  In the United States and other areas with similar climates, RSV infections occur primarily during fall, winter, and spring (https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/research/us-surveillance.html). It is currently winter in Chile.  It is not clear what may have led to this current RSV outbreak in Chile. In 2001, an outbreak of RSV struck Santiago, Chile. 150 hospital admissions were registered daily during the height of the southern hemisphere winter. It was speculated that pollution may have played a role as Santiago is one of the world's most polluted cities. Chile's geography of surrounding mountains and heat inversions in winter dramatically increases the concentration of pollutants. Pollution leads to irritation of the respiratory tract making it more difficult for the immune system to respond to infections. (Excerpted from C Orellana.

J Virol. 2017. pii: JVI.00764-17. abstract\navailable at (http://jvi.asm.org/content/91/17/e00764-17.abstract)\n-\nAbstract\n\nAlthough shrews are one of the largest groups of mammals, little is\nknown about their role in the evolution and transmission of viral\npathogens, including coronaviruses (CoVs). We captured 266 Asian house\nshrews (_Suncus murinus_) in Jiangxi and Zhejiang Provinces, China,\nduring 2013 to 2015. CoV RNA was detected in 24 Asian house shrews,\nwith an overall prevalence of 9.02 percent. Complete viral genome\nsequences were successfully recovered from the RNA-positive samples.\nThe newly discovered shrew CoV fell into 4 lineages reflecting their\ngeographic origins, indicative of largely allopatric evolution.\nNotably, these viruses were most closely related to alphacoronaviruses\nbut sufficiently divergent that they should be considered a novel\nmember of the genus _Alphacoronavirus_, which we denote Wénchéng\nshrew virus (WESV). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that WESV was a\nhighly divergent member of the alphacoronaviruses and, more\ndramatically, that the S gene of WESV fell in a cluster that was\ngenetically distinct from that of known coronaviruses. The divergent\nposition of WESV suggests that coronaviruses have a long association\nwith Asian house shrews. In addition, the genome of WESV contains a\ndistinct NS7 gene that exhibits no sequence similarity to genes of any\nknown viruses. Together, these data suggest that shrews are natural\nreservoirs for coronaviruses and may have played an important and\nlong-term role in CoV evolution. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) Coronavirus (subfamily Coronavirinae) are of importance because they\ncomprise several human and animal pathogens. The origin of\nalphacoronaviruses had been linked to bats. These data suggest that\nshrews might have played a role, too. - Mod.PM A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at:\n(http://healthmap.org/promed/p/155).

(promed@promedmail.org)  The Chinese giant salamander (_Andrias davidianus_) is the largest amphibian in the world. It can grow to more than one meter (3.3 ft) in length. This species used to be widespread in central, south western, and southern China, but it is considered to be critically endangered. It has declined catastrophically over the last 30 years, principally due to over-exploitation, and it is now very rare, with few surviving populations known. Commercial over-exploitation for human consumption is the main threat to this species. It has also suffered from habitat destruction (such as from the construction of dams) and habitat degradation (such as water pollution from mines). For a picture go to (http://www.factzoo.com/sites/all/img/amphibians/salamander/chinese-giant-salamander.jpg).  In 2010, an outbreak of disease occurred amongst farmed Chinese giant salamanders in Shanxi Province, China. Clinical signs included anorexia, lethargy, ecchymosis, and swollen areas on the head and limbs and skin ulceration. An investigation was carried out and they isolated for the 1st time a ranavirus infection associated with mass mortality in Chinese giant salamanders. This virus was named Chinese giant salamander virus (CGSV-L). This virus has not been studied in the wild. It might be possible that it circulates causing little impact, but under the stressing circumstances that might arise in captivity the virulence increases. - Mod.PMB  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/58595).

They\nhave been isolated in a hospital for close monitoring. Results of\ntests conducted on them will be released Wed 16 Aug 2017,\" said\nHealth Assistant Secretary Eric Tayag said on Tue 15 Aug 2017. Earlier, Health Secretary Roselyn Ubial said only those who are\nexposed to the farms and fowls in San Luis are being monitored for\ncases of chicken-to-human transmission of bird flu virus. Up to 12 quarantine stations have been set up in affected areas. It\nwill take 90 days for them to be declared free of bird flu, Ubial\nsaid, adding that flu vaccines could not protect humans against the\nbird flu virus, but could guard against flu mutation once a person was\ninfected of bird flu. A series of test has confirmed that H5 avian influenza, not the H7\nbird flu strain, hit the farms in San Carlos and Sta Rita villages, of\nSan Luis town, Pampanga. There has been no animal-to-human\ntransmission of the disease yet, confirmed Agriculture Secretary Manny\nPiñol. The agriculture department began culling chickens, ducks, game fowl,\nand quail through carbon dioxide suffocation, in San Carlos and Sta.\nRita villages, San Luis town on Sat 12 Aug 2017. A total of 400 000\nbirds would be culled, Piñol estimated. Policemen and agriculture authorities have also imposed checks on all\nexit and entry points in 12 towns in Pampanga provinces. The transport\nof poultry products from 5 villages in 3 towns of Pampanga such as\nMexico, San Luis, Sta. Ana has been strictly prohibited. The agriculture department is also investigating the source of the\ndisease whether it was brought by migratory birds or by ducks smuggled\nfrom China. Governor Lilia Pineda has placed the entire Pampanga\nprovince under a state of calamity following the outbreak of avian\nflu. This could mean P2 billion (Dh166 million) loss for the poultry\nsector, but poultry owners affected by the bird flu virus will be\ncompensated, she added. Pampanga is one of the major sources of poultry products sold in Metro\nManila and Central Luzon. A report on the country's bird flu outbreak\nwill be submitted to the Paris-based World Organization for Animal\nHealth. A poultry owner reported the deaths of at least 15 000 quail\nbirds in San Carlos village in April and May 2017. The disease has\nkilled a total of 37.000 fowls since April 2017. Bird flu viruses\nhave spread in Europe and Africa in recent months. The H7N9 strain has\nled to transmission to human cases, including fatalities, in China. Byline: Barbara Mae Dacanay \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) The above report does not specify the N subtype of H5 viruses\nreported in poultry and 2 farm workers have reported flu like\nsymptoms, but the confirmation of influenza subtype is awaited. According to the last WHO update See Promed Post: Avian influenza,\nhuman (65): China (GD) H9N2, human-animal interface, WHO http://promedmail.org/post/20170812.5242688 , dated 25 July 2017, no\nrecent laboratory-confirmed human cases of influenza A(H5N1) virus\ninfection have been reported to WHO during the last 2 updates. Since\n2003, a total of 859 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection\nwith avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, including 453 deaths, have been\nreported to WHO from 16 countries. In 2017, 3 human cases of A/H5N1\nwith one death have been reported from Egypt so\nfar.(http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/2017_07_25_tableH5N1.pdf?ua=1).\nFurthermore, to date, no human cases of infection with influenza\nA(H5N8) have been detected. Influenza A(H5) subtype viruses have the potential to cause disease in\nhumans and thus far, no human cases, other than those with influenza\nA(H5N1) and A(H5N6) viruses, have been reported to WHO. According to\nreports received by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE),\nvarious influenza A(H5) subtypes continue to be detected in birds in\nAfrica, Europe and Asia. - Mod.UBA A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at:\n(http://healthmap.org/promed/p/158).

Date: Fri 18 Aug 2017. Source: The Pirbright Institute, UK, News (edited) (https://www.pirbright.ac.uk/news/2017/08/african-swine-fever-advance-through-europe)   The continued advance of African swine fever (ASF) through eastern European countries has triggered concern amongst pig farmers and governing bodies. DEFRA UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs has upgraded the threat to the UK from 'very low' to 'low'  meaning the risk is \"rare but could occur\" (EFSA European Food Safety Authority terminology). This severe disease of pigs entered Europe through Georgia in 2007, and has since continued to the Russian Federation and eastern Europe, including EU countries in the Baltic States, Poland and very recently the Czech Republic, in wild boar. In early August 2017, an outbreak was confirmed for the 1st time in Romania among backyard pigs.  African swine fever is caused by infection with ASF virus (ASFV), which can have fatality rates of up to 100 per cent. The virus causes acute disease in domestic pigs and wild boar, and may cause varying clinical signs that are similar to other pig diseases such as high fever, lethargy and loss of appetite. Pigs may also die suddenly without clinical signs.  Although the virus does not cause disease in humans, the impact it has on the economy, especially through trade and farming, is substantial. As a consequence of ASF in Poland and the Baltic States the value of pork and pig exports was reduced by USD 960 million (2014-2015). In Denmark, the predicted impact of an ASF outbreak is estimated at USD 12 million in direct losses and USD 349 million in exports.  Unless the appropriate control measures are put in place, additional outbreaks could occur across Europe, further into Russia and beyond to Asia. An outbreak in the UK is unlikely as imports of meat and pigs are extremely well regulated and the UK does not have a wild boar population substantial enough or widespread enough to maintain an outbreak. However, personal imports of pork products from affected areas could result in disease incursion if deliberately or accidently fed to pigs or wild boar, actions which are illegal.  The seriousness of an outbreak for some countries could be far worse than others; China is home to over half the world's pig population and an outbreak of ASF could result in devastating consequences. In a Veterinary Record article see reference below world-expert on ASF Dr Linda Dixon leader of the ASF group at The Pirbright Institute, outlines the factors that increase the likelihood of ASF spreading to China and highlights areas that could be improved to reduce the risk of an outbreak including biosecurity.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  Subscribers may refer to more data in the article above, addressing the following questions: - how does ASF spread? - how quickly does it spread? - how can the spread of ASFV be prevented? - what is The Pirbright Institute doing to help?  The last item includes the following statement: \"The vaccine research is crucial for the prevention and control of ASF, and good progress has so far been made. An effective vaccine will enable better control and prevention measures to be put in place in the future, helping stem the losses currently being suffered by farmers around the world.\"  The editorial \"Preparing for the worst: African swine fever in China\", by Linda K Dixon, was recently published in the Veterinary Record  Vet Rec. 2017; 181: 115-6, doi: 10.1136/vr.j3525.

This came about after 2\nkidney recipients in Taiwan were diagnosed with dengue 2 days after\nreceiving a kidney each from the same donor, said National Cheng Kung\nUniversity microbiology and immunology professor Dr Oscar Perng\nGuey-chuen. \"This indicates a potential risk,\" the Taiwan-based\nscientist said, adding that no dengue virus was detected in the\ndonor's blood. He said the donor contracted dengue in 2015 and in mid-2016, he died\nin an accident. His family donated his corneas, liver, heart, and\nkidneys. Both patients had the same strain of the dengue virus the\ndonor had in 2015 and one of the recipients died of dengue\nhaemorrhagic fever, he said. Asked where the virus could be hiding since it could not be detected\nin the blood, he said it was a question scientists are trying to\nanswer. Interestingly, those who received the donor's corneas, liver,\nand heart did not develop dengue, Dr Perng said on the sidelines of\nthe National Dengue And Arboviruses Infection Conference 2017\nyesterday 12 Aug 2017. He said although there was not enough\nevidence to show the virus came from the donor as the kidneys were not\ntested for dengue before the transplant, the same virus was found in\nthe patients' bodies after that. Dr Perng said his team had studied mice for dengue virus in the blood\ntestes, kidney, liver, spleen and brain, and found the virus present\nin the kidneys and brain. \"We believe the virus probably resided in\nthe kidneys and was not cleared by the body,\" he said, adding that the\nvirus could have been activated after transplant. He said this raised\nconcerns about asymptomatic people who are dengue carriers. Health Ministry deputy director, general Datuk Dr S Jeyaindran said\npatients with severe dengue would have better recovery if they were\ngiven colloids, a more concentrated fluid, at the early stage in fluid\nmanagement for dengue patients. Dr Jeyaindran, who was representing\nHealth Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam, said colloids may be\nintroduced at an earlier stage, instead of saline because it has not\nbeen successful in treating patients with severe dengue. He said more\nstudies will be conducted to find out at which stage the colloids\nshould be given. byline: Loh Foon Fong \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) - Air travel related spread of dengue.\nDate: Thu 3 Aug 2017.\nSource: Medical Xpress (edited)\n(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-08-air-responsible-dengue-asia.html) \nWhile the incidences of many other infectious diseases have declined\nover the past decade, the number of cases and outbreaks of dengue\nvirus have continued to increase. The spread of dengue to new areas is\nlikely due in large part to trends in air travel, researchers now\nreport in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Dengue virus affects as estimated 390 million people around the globe\neach year, and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild fever and\nheadache to severe low blood pressure. The virus has mostly caused\ndisease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, but a 2014\noutbreak in Japan broke that pattern. Overall, the geographic area\naffected by dengue has been growing in recent years. In the new work, Huaiyu Tian and Bing Xu, both of Beijing Normal\nUniversity, China, together with colleagues from the University of\nOxford and elsewhere analyzed the spread of dengue viruses in Asia\nfrom 1956 to 2015. They used 2202 genetic sequences of dengue viruses,\ncollected in 20 countries or regions of Asia over the 59 years, to\ndetermine how different strains were related. They also investigated\ntrends in air travel, maritime mobility, migration, and\nsocio-economics to determine what factors impact the spread of\ndengue. The spread of 3 different dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1, -2, and -3,\nis associated with air traffic more so than any other factors, the\ndata revealed. Air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India, the\nresearchers found, help seed dengue epidemics, while China, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, and Singapore help diffuse the virus to other Asian\ncountries. \"Future trends in global mobility could potentially accelerate the\nappearance and diffusion of DENV worldwide,\" the researchers say.\n\"Prevention and control of dengue epidemics requires a better\nunderstanding of its mode of geographic dissemination, especially for\ncountries in the tropics.\" Reference: Tian H, Sun Z, Faria NR, et al.

Date: Tue 29 Aug 2017 21:06 (http://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2017-08-29/bluetongue-line-moves-south-in-the-nt/8848908)   Approximately 20 new properties within Central Australia and the Barkly now fall within the bluetongue virus zone within the Northern Territory, according to the Department of Primary Industry.  Changes to the zone, introduced last month July 2017, mean 10 of those additional properties are within the transmission zone, and 10 within the surveillance zone.  Bluetongue is an insect borne, non-contagious viral disease, and the changes mean properties affected will not be able to export to a number of markets that have restrictions in place, such as China and Turkey.  Peter Saville, senior veterinary officer in Alice Springs with the Department, said in his 14 years working in the area, the line was the lowest he had ever seen it.  \"What we found is that a number of properties north of the Alice Springs districts have had cattle which have seroconverted, which means that they've been exposed to the bluetongue virus, and those properties are much further south than they normally are.\"  Weather to blame According to Mr Saville, the change earlier in the year was due to a summer of high temperatures and high rainfall, resulting in the increased number of insects. \"It is insect movement that controls this, and as such there's not a lot we can do, so we just have to wait and see, we can't speculate on what might happen,\" he said.  Mr Saville said ownership changes could affect zoning.  \"One of the things that has contributed to this is a lot of properties have amalgamated their pics property identification codes because they're now under one ownership, and that means that even if part of their property is in a zone then the whole of the property is regarded as being in that zone.\"  Fluid line movement However Mr Saville said the line could once again move north depending on weather.  \"We wait until the end of summer, the end of the transmission season, and then we go out and test a number of properties to find out if there's been any evidence of viral activity.  \"Once those results are in, the NAMP National Arbovirus Monitoring Program committee meets and decides where the blue tongue line is going to go, and where the limits of the zones are.\"  Mr Saville said producers should visit the Animal Health Australia website if they want more information about the changes, and contact their livestock agent.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)   <br><br><strong>{2}</strong>. Date: Thu 30 Aug 2017. From: Mark Shipp (Mark.Schipp@agriculture.gov.au) (edited)   The National Arbovirus Monitoring Program (NAMP) maps areas in Australia where bluetongue virus transmission occurs, using both sentinel herds and additional sampling of herds when mustered.  Sentinel herds are bled and tested regularly, however in very remote areas where sentinel herds are not practical, cattle are sampled during the annual muster.  Bluetongue viral transmission occurs in parts of Australia but disease has not been reported.  There is a buffer zone between the zone where bluetongue virus transmission can occur and the zone free of bluetongue virus transmission. This is called the surveillance zone and is 50 Km 31.06 mi wide. The distance maintained between records of viral transmission and the boundary of the free zone is always maintained at a distance of 100 km 62.13 and follows property boundaries.  Yearly variation in the distribution of the main insect vector Culicoides brevitarisis means that the NAMP records some variation in the zone boundary from year to year. The map was most recently updated on Wed 16 Aug 2017. Detection of viral transmission immediately results in a zone expansion however zone contraction requires 2 years of negative surveillance results. The variations in the boundary are generally small and are considered routine. The NT example is confounded by changes in the management of land that have seen the amalgamation of properties. Because the zone boundary follows property boundaries this has exaggerated the zone extension. Property sizes can be extensive; up to 12 000 square km 4633.22 square miles in some cases.  There can be a lag period observed between viral transmission and antibody detection, particularly where surveillance is based on sampling mustered animals rather than sentinel herds. This maybe where the confusion has arisen in the quoted media report. Sero-conversion was detected in winter but arose from insect activity earlier in the season. The media report is inaccurate in relation to market access.  Recently negotiated conditions with China allow access for Australian feeder and slaughter cattle raised in areas where bluetongue virus transmission can occur. Parts of China record transmission of bluetongue virus year round and most of China (like parts of Australia) experiences times in the year where bluetongue viral transmission can occur (seasonal transmission).  The bulk of cattle in the Northern Territory are exported to markets that are endemic for bluetongue and while export conditions are applied, they are generally not trade restrictive.  The report of the zone expansion is publically available through the NAMP web site that is hosted on the Animal Health in Australia Web site.  It is certainly true that some markets require animals to be sourced from bluetongue virus free areas. This is the main reason that the NAMP program is maintained as it provides access for Australian cattle to these markets by confirming a zone free from viral transmission.  Objectives of the NAMP are: 1. Market access - to facilitate the export of live cattle, sheep and goats, and ruminant genetic material, to countries with concerns about bluetongue, Akabane and bovine ephemeral fever (BEF) viruses 2. Bluetongue early warning - to detect incursions of exotic strains of bluetongue virus (BTV) and vectors (Culicoides species biting midges) into Australia by surveillance of the northern BTV epidemic area. 3. Risk management - to detect changes in the seasonal distribution in Australia of endemic bluetongue, Akabane and BEF viruses and their vectors, to support livestock exporters.   Mark Schipp Chief Veterinary Officer (Australia) OIE Delegate (Australia) Vice-President OIE Assembly 7 London Cct, Canberra ACT 2600 GPO Box 858, Australia (mark.schipp@agriculture.gov.au)  In previous situations the line has been moved to reflect the seroconverstion, not actual disease discoveries. I reached out to Dr Schipp with some questions. Below are our question and answers:  ProMED-mail moderator (hence PMM): It appears this is a standard line movement based on seroconverstion - without actual disease? Could you clarify for me please?  Dr Schipp: Yes this is a regular adjustment of line to reflect seroconverstion with clinical disease.  PMM: Also the way this article is written is a bit confusing to me. As it is late August/1st of September, so I am thinking you may in late winter/early spring, yet the article above talks about frosts in the winter?  Dr Schipp: The hope expressed by Dr Saville is that the frosts currently being experienced in the central Austral winter will deplete the number of _Culicoides_ able to over winter to then become abundant in the spring and summer.  ProMED-mail thanks Dr Schipp for his promt reply and for taking the time to clarify issues regarding the surveillance line.  Information for understanding Bluetongue. Bluetongue virus (BTV) can and does affect cattle.  The disease is caused by an orbivirus belonging to the family _Reoviridae_. There are 25 serotypes of bluetongue virus and 10 of these have been isolated in Australia. Orbiviruses are insect-borne viruses (arboviruses) transmitted by _Culicoides_ midges. Many other non bluetongue orbiviruses are also endemic in Australia.  Bluetongue is an insect-borne, viral disease that can affect sheep, goats, deer, and cattle. Sheep are the most seriously affected species; clinical disease and mortalities occur and production and trade losses may result. Most infections in cattle are unapparent.  A number of bluetongue serotypes are present in Australia, but the severe clinical disease seen in other countries has not occurred here. Disease has been produced in experimentally infected sheep with some serotypes present in Australia.  Bluetongue virus serotype 1 was 1st identified in Australia in 1975 from trapped insects in the Northern Territory (NT) but despite its long-term presence, it has not caused any clinical disease. Since that time 9 more serotypes have been isolated in the NT. The distribution of BTV in Australia has been monitored in the National Arbovirus Monitoring Program (NAMP) for many years and the zones of BTV virus transmission and freedom are mapped and updated regularly on the Animal Health Australia website. - Mod.TG  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/292).

Five districts in 3 governorates are now infected.  The total number of cVDPV2 cases is 33 (this includes the previously reported 29 cases from Mayadeen district, Deir ez-Zor governorate, and 1 case from Tell Abyad district, Raqqa governorate). All confirmed cases to date have had onset of paralysis before 11 Jul 2017.  Final lab results for an additional 9 poliovirus type-2 (PV2) isolates from Deir ez-Zor are pending.  Discussions around expanding the scope of the immunization response to include accessible areas of a Tadmour sub-district in Homs, bordering Deir ez-Zor , will be held in light of the confirmation of the cases in this area.  Raqqa governorate commenced its 1st immunization round on 12 Aug 2017 (Raqqa and Thawra districts) and 13 Aug 2017 (Tell Abyad district). The immunization round aims to reach 120 000 children under 5 years of age. Preliminary information suggests the rounds are reaching children in all 3 districts.  Preparations continue for the 2nd round in Deir ez-Zor governorate, scheduled for 19-23 Aug 2017. IPV inactivated polio vaccine for use in the 2nd rounds in Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa governorates has arrived in Damascus.  The total number of AFP acute flaccid paralysis cases detected in Deir ez-Zor governorate since the beginning of 2017 is 113 (83 from Mayadeen, 11 from Deir ez-Zor, and 19 from Boukamal districts). Raqqa governorate has reported 16 AFP cases (5 from Raqqa, 10 from Tell Abyad, and 1 from Thawra districts). Homs governorate has reported 26 AFP cases (11 from Homs city, 12 from Rastan, 1 from Tadmour, and 2 from Talkalakh districts).  The Eradication and Outbreak Management Group (EOMG) has approved the release of additional doses of IPV to cover high risk population groups in northwest Syria, Turkey, and Lebanon. Lebanon requested 144 000 doses and has begun to implement IPV campaigns across the country.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Unfortunately transmission of the cVDPV2 in Syria has continued. With each report, the date of onset of the most recent case shifts to a date approximately one month preceding the report, probably reflecting the time it takes from specimen collection to appropriate reference laboratory. We are fairly sure there will be an additional 9 cases confirmed from Deir ez-Zor, as the report above mentions that there are 9 poliovirus isolates pending typing (WPV vs cVDPV). The report also mentions a significant number of AFP cases identified in the 3 governorates, suggesting there may be more cases in the pipeline for confirmation. The control activities have been implemented during this week and will be implemented in additional areas next week week of 21 Aug 2017, so hopefully there will be interruption of transmission going forward.  The disturbing news in the situation report above, is that there is now involvement of 3 governorates. Deir ez-Zor, Raqqa, and now Homs. On a map of Syria showing provinces/governorates ((http://www.freeworldmaps.net/asia/syria/syria-political-map.jpg)), one can see that Deir ez-Zor, the main governorate involved in this outbreak is located in the northeast of the country sharing it's eastern border with Iraq. It shares a southern border with Homs, and a western border with Raqqa (Ar-Raqqah on this map) governorate. Hopefully the cVDPV2 will not continue to travel in the country outside of the currently 3 affected areas. - Mod.MPP   <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Somalia: declared polio free. Date: Mon 14 Aug 2017. Source: AllAfrica, Shabelle Media Network (Mogadishu) report (edited) (http://allafrica.com/stories/201708150227.html)   The UN World Health Organisation (WHO) said it had not recorded any case of polio disease in Somalia in the last 3 years, declaring the country polio free.  The WHO said the country recorded the last case of polio in 2014 in the central part of the country but has since then remained free of the paralyzing disease.  The UN health agency, however, warned Somalia remained vulnerable, calling for continued vaccination campaign, Xinhua News Agency reported.  The head of the WHO Eastern Mediterranean, which covers Somalia, Mohamed Fiqi said that massive vaccination campaigns and commitment from government and international actors had ensured the polio virus did not recur in the Horn of Africa country.  \"As the world edges closer to eradicating polio, keeping alert in countries that have high risk of polio importation like Somalia is more of priority than ever,\" Fiqi said.  \"As we move forward, the polio programme in Somalia needs to continue to work to maintain and improve the level of population immunity against polio through target vaccination campaign and strengthening of the routine immunisation services and infrastructure,\" Fiqi added.  The declaration by WHO keeps Somalia outside the last group of countries which still record cases of polio in the world.  Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan are the remaining countries where polio is still being recorded. The WHO chief warned Somalia remains at risk of importation of the virus from these countries.  Somalia President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo praised efforts to rid his country of the polio disease which he noted had subjected many children into suffering.  \"No cases were found for the past 3 years and no child was affected by this disease. Many of our children have suffered from polio for many years.  \"To eradicate polio was a big success and it was collective effort and commitment by many young men and women who sacrificed their lives,\" Farmaajo noted.  The 3 year polio-free celebration comes amidst the worst outbreak of measles the country has seen in years.  Somalia is also still responding to an outbreak of acute watery diarrhoea/cholera, which began in January 2017. Polio systems and networks are being used in both interventions.  \"Polio infrastructure has been critical in responding to these other serious outbreaks,\" said Fiqi.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  Achieving 3 years with no new cases of polio reported is a significant achievement for Somalia. That being said, it's important to remember that this too is a country with internal civil strife and warring factions, which may impede the identification of poliovirus associated disease either due to infrastructural challenges in good specimen collection and transport, or access of the population to the healthcare infrastructure. A reminder is the identification of WPV associated cases in Borno, Nigeria last year (2016), involving a virus last seen 5 years before in the same state.

We continue to work together to advance shared priorities, including governance and democracy, regional security, poverty reduction, polio eradication, trade, defense, and the fight against climate change.\"  - The 14th Emergency Committee for polio eradication under the International Health Regulations met on 3 Aug 2017 and has made its recommendations to the WHO Director-General, who has accepted them. The Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and recommended the extension of revised Temporary Recommendations for a further 3 months. The key change is the inclusion of DR Congo and Syria in the category 'States infected with cVDPV2s, with potential risk of international spread'.  - Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: Afghanistan: 1 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case; Pakistan: 1 new WPV1-positive environmental sample; Syrian Arab Republic: 3 new circulating vaccine-derived polio type 2 (cVDPV2) from Syria, 2 from Deir ez-Zor and 1 from Homs governorates. Details in country-specific sections below.  Afghanistan  - One new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week, bringing the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 to 6. It is the most recent case in the country, and had onset of paralysis on 10 Jul 2017, from Zabul province, neighbouring Kandahar province and Pakistan. - Afghanistan continues to coordinate activities with neighbouring Pakistan, to address both cross-border transmission and focus on reaching mobile populations with oral polio vaccine (OPV). Transmission linking both countries runs primarily across 3 corridors, namely: eastern Afghanistan and Khyber-Peshawar, Pakistan; greater Kandahar/Helmand and Quetta, Pakistan; and, Paktika/Patkya/Khost and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa/Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Pakistan.  Pakistan  - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week; the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 3. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 11 Jun 2017, from Killa Abdullah, Balochistan. - 1 new WPV1-positive environmental sample was reported in the past week, collected on 28 Jul 2017, from Quetta, Balochistan. - A special vaccination round is being implemented during August 2017 targeting areas with recent polio cases and positive environmental samples. These include Rawalpindi/Islamabad and demographically connected areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Quetta Block, and parts of Karachi. - Under the National Emergency Action Plan for polio eradication, the country is planning to implement 2 nation-wide and 2 sub-national vaccination rounds from September to December 2017.  Nigeria - - No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 21 Aug 2016 in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno. - Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016). - Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance.  Lake Chad Basin  - The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno, Nigeria in 2016) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) (Borno and Sokoto provinces in Nigeria in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak. - Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.  Central Africa  - No new cases of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). The total number of cVDPV2 cases this year 2017 remains 7, in 2 separate outbreaks: in Haut Lomami province (5 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on 13 Jun 2017); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on 26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017, with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May 2017). - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time. Outbreak response is taking place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols, targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 across the 2 provinces. - The 1st mOPV2 round was implemented on 27-29 Jun 2017 in the 2 affected provinces; and the 2nd mOPV2 round ran from 13-15 Jul 2017 in Haut Lomami and 20-22 Jul 2017 in Maniema. - Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.  Middle East  - In Syria, 3 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were officially reported in the past week. The total number of cases in this outbreak is 33. Onset of paralysis of these cases is between 3 Mar 2017 and 10 Jul 2017. 31 of the cases are from Deir ez-Zor governorate (29 from Mayadeen district, one from Deir ez-Zor district, and one from Boukamal district); 1 case is from Talabyad district, Raqqa governorate; and, 1 is from Tadmour district in Homs governorate. - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized and implemented, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Two vaccination campaigns are planned for both Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa governorates. If there is geographic spread, the extent of these campaigns will have to be adjusted. - The 1st mOPV2 round in Deir ez-Zor was successfully carried out between 22-26 Jul 2017. Independent post-campaign monitoring reflected coverage of 88.4 percent (based on caregiver recall). The 2nd round is planned for 19-23 Aug 2017, and will include mOPV2 and IPV. - Raqqa Governorate started mOPV2 campaigns on 12 Aug 2017. - Plans are being finalized to mitigate the risks of further spread from the outbreak zone to neighbouring areas and countries, including immunization of at-risk populations in northwest Syria, Turkey and Lebanon. Following confirmation of the case in Homs, discussions are ongoing to further extend the geographic reach of the outbreak response.

(promed@promedmail.org)  This week's global update is similar to prior weeks in terms of low level identification of WPV1 associated disease (a single case confirmed in Afghanistan this past week), one positive WPV1 isolated from an environmental sample in Pakistan, and 3 newly confirmed cVDPV2 associated cases in Syria.  That being said, there have only been 9 confirmed cases of WPV1 associated paralytic disease worldwide this year (2017), compared with 37 cases reported last year (2016). In contrast there have been 40 confirmed cases of cVDPV2 confirmed this year (2017) compared with 5 last year (2016). As a reminder, outbreaks due to cVDPV's are considered as significant in the big picture of polio eradication, as they are due to vaccine polioviruses that have reverted in neurovirulence following passage through multiple individuals while circulating in the susceptible population. The goal of the polio eradication initiative is to interrupt transmission of both the WPV's and the cVDPVs. The presence of cVDPVs occurs when there are areas with low vaccination coverage where the vaccine virus (from the OPV) can continue circulating through the susceptible population.

Ending the outbreak and preventing its spread beyond Tanzania's\nborders is a high priority for WHO. To that end, WHO and partners\nsupport a well-coordinated multisectoral response through the National\nCholera Task Force which plans, coordinates and support subnational\nauthorities. Indeed, learning requires a continuous assessment of performance, a\nreview of successes and failures and a robust support for improvement.\nAn After Action Review (AAR) is a simple methodology for facilitating\nthis assessment. It provides for a qualitative review of actions taken\nto respond to an emergency as a means of identifying best practices,\ngaps and lessons learned. As a component of the IHR Monitoring and\nEvaluation Framework (IHR MEF) and part of the preparedness and\nresponse cycle, an AAR seeks to identify what worked well or not and\nhow these practices can be maintained, improved, institutionalized and\nshared with relevant stakeholders. It is within this context that WHO\nsupported the Ministry of Health to convene a meeting of experts to\nconduct an After Action Review following the national response to the\ncholera outbreak. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{3}</strong> Cholera - Sudan.\nDate: Thu 17 Aug 2017.\nSource: Radio Dabanga (edited)\n(http://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/cholera-new-deaths-and-infections-across-sudan) \nSinga Hospital in Sudan's Sennar received 16 new cases of cholera\nduring the 1st half of this week week of Sun 13 Aug 2017.

From Saturday to Monday 12-14 Aug 2017,\n26 cases of cholera arrived from Um Benin village. This led the local\nhealth authorities to open a new cholera isolation centre at the\nvillage. El Gedaref State\nEl Gedaref Hospital in East Sudan recorded 15 cases of cholera on\nTuesday and Wednesday 15-16 Aug 2017. A medical source told Radio\nDabanga that the hospital received 9 cases on Tue 15 Aug 2017, while\n6 cases were recorded on Wed 16Aug 2017.

The 1st 2 cases of\ncholera were tested positive by National Institute of Health Islamabad\non Mon 31 Jul 2017 and another 2 confirmed positive for the\ninfection on Fri 4 Aug 2017. All the 4 patients were undergoing\ntreatment at Benazir Bhutto Hospital BH where as many as 4 more\nsuspects of the infection have been admitted for treatment. Data collected by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017 reveals that the\nallied hospitals have sent stool samples of over 10 child patients to\nNIH for confirmation of cholera in last week week of Sun 6 Aug\n2017. On Sat 12 Aug 2017, as many as 20 child patients with severe\ndiarrhoea were admitted at the BBH of which 4 were suspected as\npatients of cholera and their stool samples were sent to NIH for\nconfirmation, said Associate Professor of Paediatrics at Rawalpindi\nMedical University Dr Tariq Saeed when contacted by 'The News' on Mon\n14 Aug 2017. He added the hospital has not received confirmation reports from the\nNIH because of holidays there from Saturday to Monday. However, we\nhave been keeping the suspects in isolation under strict monitoring,\nhe said. He added that repeated rainfalls in the region and water inundation\ninside and outside homes in a number of localities particularly in\nthickly populated areas of the city are causing contamination of water\nand foodstuff that increases chances of spread of a number of\ninfections among population while children are at greater risk of\ncontracting life-threatening infections including cholera. It is important that the transmission of cholera occurs primarily by\ndrinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the feces\n(waste product) of an infected person, including one with no apparent\nsymptoms. It is observed that heavy rainfall causes collection of heavily\ncontaminated water in streets and houses and the waste water flooding\nout of various nullahs watercourses including Nullah Leh in town\ncauses infections including cholera, typhoid, dysentery,\ngastroenteritis, hepatitis A and E, shigellosis and giardiasis. Professor Tariq said the consumption of contaminated water and\nfoodstuff causes cholera, an infection in the small intestine caused\nby bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. Its main symptoms are watery diarrhea\nand vomiting that can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte\nimbalance, and death in cases which are not treated in time, he said. Health experts say that to avoid cholera and other infections, one\nmust use boiled water for drinking and should use vegetables after\nwashing with clean water and it must be kept in mind that raw\nvegetables should not be eaten in the existing weather conditions\ninstead these should be used after cooking. To a query, Professor Tariq said the heavy rainfall and water\naccumulation may contaminate water at sources and there may be chances\nof contamination of water at tube wells so individuals must boil water\nbefore drinking to avoid cholera and other infections. He added the appearance of cholera is alarming and it is time for\npeople to take extra ordinary preventive measures to safeguard their\nchildren and themselves from the disease. In case water is accumulated inside home due to heavy rainfall and\nflooded out of sewage lines, it must be wiped out immediately and the\nspace should be washed with clean water as soon as possible to avoid\ninfections. Avoiding inundation of contaminated water inside homes is\na must to avoid cholera and other infections, said Professor Tariq.

A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam; - Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas.

This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however,\nhave suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be\neffective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and\noutbreak situations (63, 64). \"References\n-\n57.

In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam;\n- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however,\nhave suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be\neffective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and\noutbreak situations (63, 64). \"References\n\n57.

The meeting was attended by the national teams as well as the staff from the southern region of Afghanistan and Balochistan province of Pakistan.  - Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: Pakistan: 2 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) environmental positive samples; Syria: 6 new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases; and, DR Congo: 1 new cVDPV2 case. Additionally, pre-notification was received this week of a new WPV1 case from Karachi, Pakistan, the 1st in Karachi since January 2016. The case will be officially reflected in next week's global data reporting.  Afghanistan  - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 6. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 10 Jul 2017, from Zabul province, neighbouring Kandahar province and Pakistan. - Preparations continue for a targeted vaccination round in the southern region of the country, scheduled on 11 Sep 2017  Pakistan  - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week; the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 3. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 11 Jun 2017, from Killa Abdullah, Balochistan. - Two new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) environmental positive samples were reported in the past week, from Karachi, Sindh (collected on 7 and 12 Aug 2017). - Additionally, pre-notification was received this week of a new WPV1 case from Karachi, Pakistan. The case will be officially reflected in next week's global data reporting. Karachi had previously been a key reservoir for WPV1 in Pakistan. Analysis is ongoing to determine the origin of this latest case and a response is being planned. The case had onset of paralysis on 11 Aug 2017. The last previous case from Karachi is from January 2016. - The National Task Force for Polio Eradication convened last week, chaired by the Prime Minister of Pakistan and attended by the senior leadership from the national and provincial levels. The Task force reviewed the revised National Emergency Action Plan 2017/18 and discussed mechanisms of accelerating the implementation of strategies to stop WPV1 transmission in the key hot spots. - Under the National Emergency Action Plan for polio eradication, the country is planning to implement 2 nation-wide and 2 sub-national vaccination rounds from September to December 2017.  Nigeria - - No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 21 Aug 2016 in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno. - Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and cVDPV2 strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016). - Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance.  Lake Chad Basin  - The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno, Nigeria in 2016) and cVDPV2 (Borno and Sokoto provinces in Nigeria in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak. - Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.  Central Africa  - One new case of cVDPV2 was reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), from Haut Lomami province, with onset of paralysis on 20 Jun 2017. The total number of cVDPV2 cases this year 2017 is now 8, in 2 separate outbreaks: in Haut Lomami province (6 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on 20 Jun 2017); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on 26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017, with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May 2017). - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time. Outbreak response is taking place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols, targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 across the 2 provinces. \n- The 1st mOPV2 round was implemented on 27-29 Jun 2017 in the 2 affected provinces; and the 2nd mOPV2 round ran from 13-15 Jul 2017 in Haut Lomami and 20-22 Jul 2017 in Maniema. - Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.  Middle East  - In Syria, 6 new cases of cVDPV2 were officially reported in the past week from Deir-Ez-Zour governorate, bringing the total number of cases in this outbreak to 39. Onset of paralysis of these cases is between 3 Mar 2017 and 10 Jul 2017. The bulk of all cases are from Deir-Ez-Zour, the epicentre of this outbreak. - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized and implemented, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Two vaccination campaigns are planned for both Deir-Ez-Zour and Raqqa governorates. - The 1st mOPV2 round in Deir-Ez-Zour was successfully carried out between 22-26 Jul 2017. Independent post-campaign monitoring reflected coverage of 88.4 percent (based on caregiver recall). - The 2nd immunization round for Deir-Ez-Zor governorate started on 22 Aug 2017 and is ongoing. Monovalent OPV2 is being provided for children between 0-59 months of age, and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) for children 2-23 months. In addition to polio vaccines, Aqua Tabs are being provided to families for water purification - 2.5 tons of water purification tablets for 400 000 people have been disseminated at health centers. - Plans are being finalized to mitigate the risks of further spread from the outbreak zone to neighbouring areas and countries, including immunization of at-risk populations in northwest Syria, Turkey and Lebanon.

All confirmed cases to date have had onset of paralysis before 14 Jul 2017. - Final lab results are pending for an additional 5 poliovirus type-2 (PV2) isolates (3 from Mayadeen and 1 from Boukamal districts, Deir Ez-Zor governorate, and 1 from Thawra district, Raqqa governorate). - The 2nd immunization round for Deir Ez-Zor started on 22 Aug 2017 and is ongoing due to high levels of population movement in and out of the governorate during the round. - WHO has organized the redistribution of vaccines and mapping of population movements to increase reach. An additional 90 000 mOPV2 doses are being transported from Damascus to Deir Ez-Zor, to cater for population influxes from As-Sukhnah, Homs governorate, and Al-Qa'im in Iraq. Corrective measures are expected to extend the round by 2 days. - Preparations for the 2nd immunization round for Raqqa are underway. - The total number of AFP cases detected in Deir Ez-Zor governorate since the beginning of 2017 is 122 (91 from Mayadeen, 10 from Deir Ez-Zor, and 21 from Boukamal districts). Raqqa governorate has reported 16 AFP cases (5 from Raqqa, 10 from Tell Abyad, and 1 from Thawra districts). Homs governorate has reported 28 AFP cases (12 from Homs city, 13 from Rastan, 1 from Tadmour and 2 from Talkalakh districts).  more details on the vaccination activities and future plans are available at the source URL as well as the epidemic curve and graphic representation of the vaccination status of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis cases by governorate and district. - Mod.MPP   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  In the above global summary, there is still identified transmission ongoing in Pakistan as seen by the positive environmental sample in Karachi as well as the early report on a case of WPV1 associated disease in Karachi. It will be interesting to learn of the genetic profile of the environmental isolates in Karachi (from this past week as well as from a few weeks ago) and compare them with the newly identified WPV1 associated case in Karachi to see if they are genetically related.  There has been more activity associated with cVDPV2 in both Syria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), with 6 newly confirmed cases in Syria and 1 newly confirmed case in the DR Congo. According to the Situation Report in section <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> above, there are still 5 additional PV2 (poliovirus type 2) isolates in Syria undergoing final testing  4 from Deir al Zour and 1 from Raqqa. Hence there will probably be more cases confirmed in the coming days or weeks. I have not been able to identify similar report information from the DR Congo outbreak so it is not clear if the transmission has been interrupted leaving a total of 8 cases, or if there are still probable cases pending confirmation.

Source: Pajhwok Afghan News (edited) (https://www.pajhwok.com/en/2017/08/28/congo-virus-kills-13-infects-42-herat)   Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has killed 13 people in western Herat province this year 2017, with another 42 being treated for the deadly virus, according to officials.  CCHF is a viral disease. Symptoms may include fever, muscle pains, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding into the skin. The CCHF virus is typically spread by tick bites or contact with livestock carrying the disease.  Health officials in Herat advised people to be careful these days due to increased interaction with livestock in the wake of Eidul Adha Sacrifice Feast; 31 Aug-4 Sep 2017, when Muslims across the globe slaughter millions of animals.  Public health director in Herat Abdul Hakim Tamana said many people lost their lives to the Congo virus in the province this year 2017. He said 55 Congo cases were registered in the civil hospital since late March and of the patients, 13 had died. The deceased included 7 men and 6 women, he added.  Tamana said the virus spread from animals and people slaughtering animals should wear gloves.  A livestock farmer, who has contracted Congo virus, said: \"When I slaughtered the sheep, its blood covered my hands and later I started falling sick.\"  Ahmad Khalil Waez, animal healthcare director, said citizens should be careful while slaughtering animals to avoid contracting the Congo virus. He said a butcher should used special glasses, coat, gloves, mask, and shoes while slaughtering the animal.  People mainly contract the CCHF virus from infected ticks or contact with infected animal blood and tissue.  There are no vaccines available to immunize animals but precautionary measures include disinfection of livestock pens, submerging livestock in solutions for decontamination, and meat packaging safeguards.  The virus has had a presence in neighbouring Iran where the virus killed 3 people in 2015.  According to the World Health Organization, CCHF's mortality rate is about 30 percent and is endemic to Africa, the Balkans and Ukraine, the Middle East, and Central Asia.  CCHF was first detected in the Crimea in 1944 and then in the Congo in 1969. In 2011, it was detected for the first time in ticks in Spain.  Byline: Storai Karimi   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  In 2008, a major outbreak was reported in Herat City, western Afghanistan, with approximately 60 suspected and 6 confirmed cases. Later, a cross-sectional seroprevalence survey was conducted among livestock-owning households in the same districts of Herat City where the outbreak had occurred, which showed that IgG seroprevalence was 11.2 and 75.0 percent in humans (n = 330) and livestock (n = 132), respectively ((https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3310665/)).  In 2016, 66 cases had been reported by 7 Sep, with 12 deaths ((http://www.emro.who.int/afg/afghanistan-news/cchf-eid.html)). CCHF virus has been observed in over 30 countries, including in Africa (Democratic Republic of Congo, South Africa, Nigeria, Senegal, Uganda, Tanzania, Mauritania, Kenya), Asia (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, China), the Middle East (Iran, Iraq, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman), and southeastern Europe (the Russian Federation, Bulgaria, Albania, Kosovo, Turkey, Greece, and Spain) ((https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23458713)).  People most at risk of contracting CCHF include animal herders, livestock workers, butchers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Healthcare workers are also at risk of infection through unprotected contact with infectious blood and body fluids while caring for patients. There is no vaccine available for either people or animals, which means prevention is crucial. - Mod.UBA  Maps of Afghanistan can be seen at (http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/afghanistan_admin-2009.jpg) and (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1757). - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ  ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Republic of Congo":{"16":{"title":"Poliomyelitis update (22): Syria, Afghanistan, Somalia,\r\n\tglobal ","date":["16","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Poliomyelitis update (22): Syria, Afghanistan, Somalia,\r\n\tglobal [EXTERNAL]","summary":" A ProMED-mail post (http://www.promedmail.org) ProMED-mail is a program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases (http://www.isid.org)  In this update: <br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Syria: WHO situation report no. 9, 15 Aug 2017 <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Somalia: declared polio free <br><br><strong>{3}</strong> Global: Global Polio Eradication Initiative, Syria, Afghanistan   <br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Syria: WHO situation report no. 9, 15 Aug 2017.

Five districts in 3 governorates are now infected.  The total number of cVDPV2 cases is 33 (this includes the previously reported 29 cases from Mayadeen district, Deir ez-Zor governorate, and 1 case from Tell Abyad district, Raqqa governorate). All confirmed cases to date have had onset of paralysis before 11 Jul 2017.  Final lab results for an additional 9 poliovirus type-2 (PV2) isolates from Deir ez-Zor are pending.  Discussions around expanding the scope of the immunization response to include accessible areas of a Tadmour sub-district in Homs, bordering Deir ez-Zor , will be held in light of the confirmation of the cases in this area.  Raqqa governorate commenced its 1st immunization round on 12 Aug 2017 (Raqqa and Thawra districts) and 13 Aug 2017 (Tell Abyad district). The immunization round aims to reach 120 000 children under 5 years of age. Preliminary information suggests the rounds are reaching children in all 3 districts.  Preparations continue for the 2nd round in Deir ez-Zor governorate, scheduled for 19-23 Aug 2017. IPV inactivated polio vaccine for use in the 2nd rounds in Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa governorates has arrived in Damascus.  The total number of AFP acute flaccid paralysis cases detected in Deir ez-Zor governorate since the beginning of 2017 is 113 (83 from Mayadeen, 11 from Deir ez-Zor, and 19 from Boukamal districts). Raqqa governorate has reported 16 AFP cases (5 from Raqqa, 10 from Tell Abyad, and 1 from Thawra districts). Homs governorate has reported 26 AFP cases (11 from Homs city, 12 from Rastan, 1 from Tadmour, and 2 from Talkalakh districts).  The Eradication and Outbreak Management Group (EOMG) has approved the release of additional doses of IPV to cover high risk population groups in northwest Syria, Turkey, and Lebanon. Lebanon requested 144 000 doses and has begun to implement IPV campaigns across the country.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Unfortunately transmission of the cVDPV2 in Syria has continued. With each report, the date of onset of the most recent case shifts to a date approximately one month preceding the report, probably reflecting the time it takes from specimen collection to appropriate reference laboratory. We are fairly sure there will be an additional 9 cases confirmed from Deir ez-Zor, as the report above mentions that there are 9 poliovirus isolates pending typing (WPV vs cVDPV). The report also mentions a significant number of AFP cases identified in the 3 governorates, suggesting there may be more cases in the pipeline for confirmation. The control activities have been implemented during this week and will be implemented in additional areas next week week of 21 Aug 2017, so hopefully there will be interruption of transmission going forward.  The disturbing news in the situation report above, is that there is now involvement of 3 governorates. Deir ez-Zor, Raqqa, and now Homs. On a map of Syria showing provinces/governorates ((http://www.freeworldmaps.net/asia/syria/syria-political-map.jpg)), one can see that Deir ez-Zor, the main governorate involved in this outbreak is located in the northeast of the country sharing it's eastern border with Iraq. It shares a southern border with Homs, and a western border with Raqqa (Ar-Raqqah on this map) governorate. Hopefully the cVDPV2 will not continue to travel in the country outside of the currently 3 affected areas. - Mod.MPP   <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Somalia: declared polio free. Date: Mon 14 Aug 2017. Source: AllAfrica, Shabelle Media Network (Mogadishu) report (edited) (http://allafrica.com/stories/201708150227.html)   The UN World Health Organisation (WHO) said it had not recorded any case of polio disease in Somalia in the last 3 years, declaring the country polio free.  The WHO said the country recorded the last case of polio in 2014 in the central part of the country but has since then remained free of the paralyzing disease.  The UN health agency, however, warned Somalia remained vulnerable, calling for continued vaccination campaign, Xinhua News Agency reported.  The head of the WHO Eastern Mediterranean, which covers Somalia, Mohamed Fiqi said that massive vaccination campaigns and commitment from government and international actors had ensured the polio virus did not recur in the Horn of Africa country.  \"As the world edges closer to eradicating polio, keeping alert in countries that have high risk of polio importation like Somalia is more of priority than ever,\" Fiqi said.  \"As we move forward, the polio programme in Somalia needs to continue to work to maintain and improve the level of population immunity against polio through target vaccination campaign and strengthening of the routine immunisation services and infrastructure,\" Fiqi added.  The declaration by WHO keeps Somalia outside the last group of countries which still record cases of polio in the world.  Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan are the remaining countries where polio is still being recorded. The WHO chief warned Somalia remains at risk of importation of the virus from these countries.  Somalia President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo praised efforts to rid his country of the polio disease which he noted had subjected many children into suffering.  \"No cases were found for the past 3 years and no child was affected by this disease. Many of our children have suffered from polio for many years.  \"To eradicate polio was a big success and it was collective effort and commitment by many young men and women who sacrificed their lives,\" Farmaajo noted.  The 3 year polio-free celebration comes amidst the worst outbreak of measles the country has seen in years.  Somalia is also still responding to an outbreak of acute watery diarrhoea/cholera, which began in January 2017. Polio systems and networks are being used in both interventions.  \"Polio infrastructure has been critical in responding to these other serious outbreaks,\" said Fiqi.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  Achieving 3 years with no new cases of polio reported is a significant achievement for Somalia. That being said, it's important to remember that this too is a country with internal civil strife and warring factions, which may impede the identification of poliovirus associated disease either due to infrastructural challenges in good specimen collection and transport, or access of the population to the healthcare infrastructure. A reminder is the identification of WPV associated cases in Borno, Nigeria last year (2016), involving a virus last seen 5 years before in the same state.

Date: Wed 16 Aug 2017. Source: Global Polio Eradication Initiative (edited) (http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/this-week/)   Poliovirus weekly update  as of 16-Aug-2017  New wild poliovirus cases reported this week: 1 Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2017: 9 Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2016: 37  New cVDPV cases reported this week: 3 Total number of cVDPV cases in 2017: 40 Total number of cVDPV cases in 2016: 5  Headlines  - Marking Pakistan's Independence Day 14 August this week, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau paid tribute to both countries' ongoing collaboration, including on the effort to eradicate polio.\" Our 2 countries established a diplomatic relationship shortly after Pakistan was declared a sovereign nation in 1947. We continue to work together to advance shared priorities, including governance and democracy, regional security, poverty reduction, polio eradication, trade, defense, and the fight against climate change.\"  - The 14th Emergency Committee for polio eradication under the International Health Regulations met on 3 Aug 2017 and has made its recommendations to the WHO Director-General, who has accepted them. The Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and recommended the extension of revised Temporary Recommendations for a further 3 months. The key change is the inclusion of DR Congo and Syria in the category 'States infected with cVDPV2s, with potential risk of international spread'.  - Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: Afghanistan: 1 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case; Pakistan: 1 new WPV1-positive environmental sample; Syrian Arab Republic: 3 new circulating vaccine-derived polio type 2 (cVDPV2) from Syria, 2 from Deir ez-Zor and 1 from Homs governorates. Details in country-specific sections below.  Afghanistan  - One new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week, bringing the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 to 6. It is the most recent case in the country, and had onset of paralysis on 10 Jul 2017, from Zabul province, neighbouring Kandahar province and Pakistan. - Afghanistan continues to coordinate activities with neighbouring Pakistan, to address both cross-border transmission and focus on reaching mobile populations with oral polio vaccine (OPV). Transmission linking both countries runs primarily across 3 corridors, namely: eastern Afghanistan and Khyber-Peshawar, Pakistan; greater Kandahar/Helmand and Quetta, Pakistan; and, Paktika/Patkya/Khost and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa/Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Pakistan.  Pakistan  - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week; the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 3. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 11 Jun 2017, from Killa Abdullah, Balochistan. - 1 new WPV1-positive environmental sample was reported in the past week, collected on 28 Jul 2017, from Quetta, Balochistan. - A special vaccination round is being implemented during August 2017 targeting areas with recent polio cases and positive environmental samples. These include Rawalpindi/Islamabad and demographically connected areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Quetta Block, and parts of Karachi. - Under the National Emergency Action Plan for polio eradication, the country is planning to implement 2 nation-wide and 2 sub-national vaccination rounds from September to December 2017.  Nigeria - - No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 21 Aug 2016 in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno. - Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016). - Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance.  Lake Chad Basin  - The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno, Nigeria in 2016) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) (Borno and Sokoto provinces in Nigeria in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak. - Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.  Central Africa  - No new cases of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). The total number of cVDPV2 cases this year 2017 remains 7, in 2 separate outbreaks: in Haut Lomami province (5 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on 13 Jun 2017); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on 26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017, with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May 2017). - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time. Outbreak response is taking place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols, targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 across the 2 provinces. - The 1st mOPV2 round was implemented on 27-29 Jun 2017 in the 2 affected provinces; and the 2nd mOPV2 round ran from 13-15 Jul 2017 in Haut Lomami and 20-22 Jul 2017 in Maniema. - Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.  Middle East  - In Syria, 3 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were officially reported in the past week. The total number of cases in this outbreak is 33. Onset of paralysis of these cases is between 3 Mar 2017 and 10 Jul 2017. 31 of the cases are from Deir ez-Zor governorate (29 from Mayadeen district, one from Deir ez-Zor district, and one from Boukamal district); 1 case is from Talabyad district, Raqqa governorate; and, 1 is from Tadmour district in Homs governorate. - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized and implemented, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Two vaccination campaigns are planned for both Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa governorates. If there is geographic spread, the extent of these campaigns will have to be adjusted. - The 1st mOPV2 round in Deir ez-Zor was successfully carried out between 22-26 Jul 2017. Independent post-campaign monitoring reflected coverage of 88.4 percent (based on caregiver recall). The 2nd round is planned for 19-23 Aug 2017, and will include mOPV2 and IPV. - Raqqa Governorate started mOPV2 campaigns on 12 Aug 2017. - Plans are being finalized to mitigate the risks of further spread from the outbreak zone to neighbouring areas and countries, including immunization of at-risk populations in northwest Syria, Turkey and Lebanon. Following confirmation of the case in Homs, discussions are ongoing to further extend the geographic reach of the outbreak response.

(promed@promedmail.org)  This week's global update is similar to prior weeks in terms of low level identification of WPV1 associated disease (a single case confirmed in Afghanistan this past week), one positive WPV1 isolated from an environmental sample in Pakistan, and 3 newly confirmed cVDPV2 associated cases in Syria.  That being said, there have only been 9 confirmed cases of WPV1 associated paralytic disease worldwide this year (2017), compared with 37 cases reported last year (2016). In contrast there have been 40 confirmed cases of cVDPV2 confirmed this year (2017) compared with 5 last year (2016). As a reminder, outbreaks due to cVDPV's are considered as significant in the big picture of polio eradication, as they are due to vaccine polioviruses that have reverted in neurovirulence following passage through multiple individuals while circulating in the susceptible population. The goal of the polio eradication initiative is to interrupt transmission of both the WPV's and the cVDPVs. The presence of cVDPVs occurs when there are areas with low vaccination coverage where the vaccine virus (from the OPV) can continue circulating through the susceptible population.

The deaths from more than 16 539 cases reported so far in\n2017 represent 94 percent of the overall incidence in the regions of\nAfrica. This follows a major epidemic reported mainly in the North\nKivu province, which is the epicentre of the conflict between rebel\ngroups and the government. In the region, health delivery services have come to a standstill\nowing to the conflict. Civilians have been forced to flee their homes,\nadding to the tens of thousands already living in camps for internally\ndisplaced people. Meanwhile, In West Africa, similarly to 2016, several countries report\nsporadic cases. Terror-ridden Nigeria is also battling a severe\noutbreak of the water borne disease with 20 deaths recorded from 809\ncases in 2017. Liberia, a hotspot for diseases, is also affected with\n6 deaths from 129 cases. There have also been outbreaks in Cameroon,\nGhana and Ivory Cast but no casualties have been reported.

Ending the outbreak and preventing its spread beyond Tanzania's\nborders is a high priority for WHO. To that end, WHO and partners\nsupport a well-coordinated multisectoral response through the National\nCholera Task Force which plans, coordinates and support subnational\nauthorities. Indeed, learning requires a continuous assessment of performance, a\nreview of successes and failures and a robust support for improvement.\nAn After Action Review (AAR) is a simple methodology for facilitating\nthis assessment. It provides for a qualitative review of actions taken\nto respond to an emergency as a means of identifying best practices,\ngaps and lessons learned. As a component of the IHR Monitoring and\nEvaluation Framework (IHR MEF) and part of the preparedness and\nresponse cycle, an AAR seeks to identify what worked well or not and\nhow these practices can be maintained, improved, institutionalized and\nshared with relevant stakeholders. It is within this context that WHO\nsupported the Ministry of Health to convene a meeting of experts to\nconduct an After Action Review following the national response to the\ncholera outbreak. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{3}</strong> Cholera - Sudan.\nDate: Thu 17 Aug 2017.\nSource: Radio Dabanga (edited)\n(http://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/cholera-new-deaths-and-infections-across-sudan) \nSinga Hospital in Sudan's Sennar received 16 new cases of cholera\nduring the 1st half of this week week of Sun 13 Aug 2017. A woman\nhas died before she could be transferred to hospital, and 9 others\nwere infected with cholera at El Matateib in North Delta locality in\nSudan's Kassala state. Sennar State\nA medical source told Radio Dabanga that most of the cases in Sennar\ncame from Um Benin village southeast of the city except for 2 cases\nfrom El Dindir and El Souki. From Saturday to Monday 12-14 Aug 2017,\n26 cases of cholera arrived from Um Benin village. This led the local\nhealth authorities to open a new cholera isolation centre at the\nvillage. El Gedaref State\nEl Gedaref Hospital in East Sudan recorded 15 cases of cholera on\nTuesday and Wednesday 15-16 Aug 2017. A medical source told Radio\nDabanga that the hospital received 9 cases on Tue 15 Aug 2017, while\n6 cases were recorded on Wed 16Aug 2017. The medic said that all\ncases of cholera came from Uktuber, El Tadamon, El Geneina, and\nKadugli districts in El Gedaref. Kassala State\nA woman has died before she could be transferred to hospital, and 9\nothers were infected with cholera at El Matateib in North Delta\nlocality in Sudan's Kassala state. Youth activist Mohamed Seyidna told\nRadio Dabanga that \"the woman died in the village before she could be\ntransferred to the hospital\". He said that the hospitalised cases at\nWagar Hospital have risen to 9. He attributed the spread of cholera in the area to water pollution and\ncalled on the health authorities to make efforts to sterilize drinking\nwater and raise awareness of the residents. National epidemic\nThe National Epidemiological Corporation reported in early July 2017\nthat nearly 24 000 Sudanese have been infected and 940 cholera\npatients have died since the outbreak of the infectious disease in\nBlue Nile state in August 2016. The Sudanese authorities however,\nrefuse to call the disease by its name, and instead refer to it as\n\"Acute Watery Diarrhea\". The National Intelligence and Security\nService has repeatedly warned medics and the press in the country not\nto make mention of cholera. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{4}</strong> Cholera - Pakistan (Punjab Province).\nDate: Wed 16 Aug 2017.\nSource: The News (edited)\n(https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/223756-Number-of-cholera-cases-continues-to-swell) \nThe number of cases of cholera, a highly contagious and fatal disease\nis continuously on the rise and there is a threat that spread of the\ninfection may take shape of an epidemic if proper preventive and\ncontrol measures are not taken well in time. The 1st 2 cases of\ncholera were tested positive by National Institute of Health Islamabad\non Mon 31 Jul 2017 and another 2 confirmed positive for the\ninfection on Fri 4 Aug 2017. All the 4 patients were undergoing\ntreatment at Benazir Bhutto Hospital BH where as many as 4 more\nsuspects of the infection have been admitted for treatment. Data collected by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017 reveals that the\nallied hospitals have sent stool samples of over 10 child patients to\nNIH for confirmation of cholera in last week week of Sun 6 Aug\n2017. On Sat 12 Aug 2017, as many as 20 child patients with severe\ndiarrhoea were admitted at the BBH of which 4 were suspected as\npatients of cholera and their stool samples were sent to NIH for\nconfirmation, said Associate Professor of Paediatrics at Rawalpindi\nMedical University Dr Tariq Saeed when contacted by 'The News' on Mon\n14 Aug 2017. He added the hospital has not received confirmation reports from the\nNIH because of holidays there from Saturday to Monday. However, we\nhave been keeping the suspects in isolation under strict monitoring,\nhe said. He added that repeated rainfalls in the region and water inundation\ninside and outside homes in a number of localities particularly in\nthickly populated areas of the city are causing contamination of water\nand foodstuff that increases chances of spread of a number of\ninfections among population while children are at greater risk of\ncontracting life-threatening infections including cholera. It is important that the transmission of cholera occurs primarily by\ndrinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the feces\n(waste product) of an infected person, including one with no apparent\nsymptoms. It is observed that heavy rainfall causes collection of heavily\ncontaminated water in streets and houses and the waste water flooding\nout of various nullahs watercourses including Nullah Leh in town\ncauses infections including cholera, typhoid, dysentery,\ngastroenteritis, hepatitis A and E, shigellosis and giardiasis. Professor Tariq said the consumption of contaminated water and\nfoodstuff causes cholera, an infection in the small intestine caused\nby bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. Its main symptoms are watery diarrhea\nand vomiting that can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte\nimbalance, and death in cases which are not treated in time, he said. Health experts say that to avoid cholera and other infections, one\nmust use boiled water for drinking and should use vegetables after\nwashing with clean water and it must be kept in mind that raw\nvegetables should not be eaten in the existing weather conditions\ninstead these should be used after cooking. To a query, Professor Tariq said the heavy rainfall and water\naccumulation may contaminate water at sources and there may be chances\nof contamination of water at tube wells so individuals must boil water\nbefore drinking to avoid cholera and other infections. He added the appearance of cholera is alarming and it is time for\npeople to take extra ordinary preventive measures to safeguard their\nchildren and themselves from the disease. In case water is accumulated inside home due to heavy rainfall and\nflooded out of sewage lines, it must be wiped out immediately and the\nspace should be washed with clean water as soon as possible to avoid\ninfections. Avoiding inundation of contaminated water inside homes is\na must to avoid cholera and other infections, said Professor Tariq. Byline: Muhammad Qasim \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-SoAs\n(promed-SoAs@promedmail.org) Aggressive interventions to stem outbreaks of cholera include\nproviding sources of clean water and a vaccination campaign. The\nfollowing is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In:\nChronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract.\nGreydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in\npress): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons,\nvaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside\nof Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as\n60-80 percent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection\nlengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are: - Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 percent (95 percent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam; - Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however,\nhave suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be\neffective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and\noutbreak situations (63, 64). \"References\n-\n57.

NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in\npress): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons,\nvaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside\nof Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as\n60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection\nlengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:\n- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam;\n- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however,\nhave suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be\neffective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and\noutbreak situations (63, 64). \"References\n\n57.

The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 11 Jun 2017, from Killa Abdullah, Balochistan. - Two new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) environmental positive samples were reported in the past week, from Karachi, Sindh (collected on 7 and 12 Aug 2017). - Additionally, pre-notification was received this week of a new WPV1 case from Karachi, Pakistan. The case will be officially reflected in next week's global data reporting. Karachi had previously been a key reservoir for WPV1 in Pakistan. Analysis is ongoing to determine the origin of this latest case and a response is being planned. The case had onset of paralysis on 11 Aug 2017. The last previous case from Karachi is from January 2016. - The National Task Force for Polio Eradication convened last week, chaired by the Prime Minister of Pakistan and attended by the senior leadership from the national and provincial levels. The Task force reviewed the revised National Emergency Action Plan 2017/18 and discussed mechanisms of accelerating the implementation of strategies to stop WPV1 transmission in the key hot spots. - Under the National Emergency Action Plan for polio eradication, the country is planning to implement 2 nation-wide and 2 sub-national vaccination rounds from September to December 2017.  Nigeria - - No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 21 Aug 2016 in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno. - Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and cVDPV2 strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016). - Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance.  Lake Chad Basin  - The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno, Nigeria in 2016) and cVDPV2 (Borno and Sokoto provinces in Nigeria in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak. - Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.  Central Africa  - One new case of cVDPV2 was reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), from Haut Lomami province, with onset of paralysis on 20 Jun 2017. The total number of cVDPV2 cases this year 2017 is now 8, in 2 separate outbreaks: in Haut Lomami province (6 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on 20 Jun 2017); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on 26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017, with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May 2017). - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time. Outbreak response is taking place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols, targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 across the 2 provinces. \n- The 1st mOPV2 round was implemented on 27-29 Jun 2017 in the 2 affected provinces; and the 2nd mOPV2 round ran from 13-15 Jul 2017 in Haut Lomami and 20-22 Jul 2017 in Maniema. - Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.  Middle East  - In Syria, 6 new cases of cVDPV2 were officially reported in the past week from Deir-Ez-Zour governorate, bringing the total number of cases in this outbreak to 39. Onset of paralysis of these cases is between 3 Mar 2017 and 10 Jul 2017. The bulk of all cases are from Deir-Ez-Zour, the epicentre of this outbreak. - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized and implemented, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Two vaccination campaigns are planned for both Deir-Ez-Zour and Raqqa governorates. - The 1st mOPV2 round in Deir-Ez-Zour was successfully carried out between 22-26 Jul 2017. Independent post-campaign monitoring reflected coverage of 88.4 percent (based on caregiver recall). - The 2nd immunization round for Deir-Ez-Zor governorate started on 22 Aug 2017 and is ongoing. Monovalent OPV2 is being provided for children between 0-59 months of age, and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) for children 2-23 months. In addition to polio vaccines, Aqua Tabs are being provided to families for water purification - 2.5 tons of water purification tablets for 400 000 people have been disseminated at health centers. - Plans are being finalized to mitigate the risks of further spread from the outbreak zone to neighbouring areas and countries, including immunization of at-risk populations in northwest Syria, Turkey and Lebanon.

All confirmed cases to date have had onset of paralysis before 14 Jul 2017. - Final lab results are pending for an additional 5 poliovirus type-2 (PV2) isolates (3 from Mayadeen and 1 from Boukamal districts, Deir Ez-Zor governorate, and 1 from Thawra district, Raqqa governorate). - The 2nd immunization round for Deir Ez-Zor started on 22 Aug 2017 and is ongoing due to high levels of population movement in and out of the governorate during the round. - WHO has organized the redistribution of vaccines and mapping of population movements to increase reach. An additional 90 000 mOPV2 doses are being transported from Damascus to Deir Ez-Zor, to cater for population influxes from As-Sukhnah, Homs governorate, and Al-Qa'im in Iraq. Corrective measures are expected to extend the round by 2 days. - Preparations for the 2nd immunization round for Raqqa are underway. - The total number of AFP cases detected in Deir Ez-Zor governorate since the beginning of 2017 is 122 (91 from Mayadeen, 10 from Deir Ez-Zor, and 21 from Boukamal districts). Raqqa governorate has reported 16 AFP cases (5 from Raqqa, 10 from Tell Abyad, and 1 from Thawra districts). Homs governorate has reported 28 AFP cases (12 from Homs city, 13 from Rastan, 1 from Tadmour and 2 from Talkalakh districts).  more details on the vaccination activities and future plans are available at the source URL as well as the epidemic curve and graphic representation of the vaccination status of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis cases by governorate and district. - Mod.MPP   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  In the above global summary, there is still identified transmission ongoing in Pakistan as seen by the positive environmental sample in Karachi as well as the early report on a case of WPV1 associated disease in Karachi. It will be interesting to learn of the genetic profile of the environmental isolates in Karachi (from this past week as well as from a few weeks ago) and compare them with the newly identified WPV1 associated case in Karachi to see if they are genetically related.  There has been more activity associated with cVDPV2 in both Syria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), with 6 newly confirmed cases in Syria and 1 newly confirmed case in the DR Congo. According to the Situation Report in section <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> above, there are still 5 additional PV2 (poliovirus type 2) isolates in Syria undergoing final testing  4 from Deir al Zour and 1 from Raqqa. Hence there will probably be more cases confirmed in the coming days or weeks. I have not been able to identify similar report information from the DR Congo outbreak so it is not clear if the transmission has been interrupted leaving a total of 8 cases, or if there are still probable cases pending confirmation.

Source: Pajhwok Afghan News (edited) (https://www.pajhwok.com/en/2017/08/28/congo-virus-kills-13-infects-42-herat)   Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has killed 13 people in western Herat province this year 2017, with another 42 being treated for the deadly virus, according to officials.  CCHF is a viral disease. Symptoms may include fever, muscle pains, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding into the skin. The CCHF virus is typically spread by tick bites or contact with livestock carrying the disease.  Health officials in Herat advised people to be careful these days due to increased interaction with livestock in the wake of Eidul Adha Sacrifice Feast; 31 Aug-4 Sep 2017, when Muslims across the globe slaughter millions of animals.  Public health director in Herat Abdul Hakim Tamana said many people lost their lives to the Congo virus in the province this year 2017. He said 55 Congo cases were registered in the civil hospital since late March and of the patients, 13 had died. The deceased included 7 men and 6 women, he added.  Tamana said the virus spread from animals and people slaughtering animals should wear gloves.  A livestock farmer, who has contracted Congo virus, said: \"When I slaughtered the sheep, its blood covered my hands and later I started falling sick.\"  Ahmad Khalil Waez, animal healthcare director, said citizens should be careful while slaughtering animals to avoid contracting the Congo virus. He said a butcher should used special glasses, coat, gloves, mask, and shoes while slaughtering the animal.  People mainly contract the CCHF virus from infected ticks or contact with infected animal blood and tissue.  There are no vaccines available to immunize animals but precautionary measures include disinfection of livestock pens, submerging livestock in solutions for decontamination, and meat packaging safeguards.  The virus has had a presence in neighbouring Iran where the virus killed 3 people in 2015.  According to the World Health Organization, CCHF's mortality rate is about 30 percent and is endemic to Africa, the Balkans and Ukraine, the Middle East, and Central Asia.  CCHF was first detected in the Crimea in 1944 and then in the Congo in 1969. In 2011, it was detected for the first time in ticks in Spain.  Byline: Storai Karimi   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  In 2008, a major outbreak was reported in Herat City, western Afghanistan, with approximately 60 suspected and 6 confirmed cases. Later, a cross-sectional seroprevalence survey was conducted among livestock-owning households in the same districts of Herat City where the outbreak had occurred, which showed that IgG seroprevalence was 11.2 and 75.0 percent in humans (n = 330) and livestock (n = 132), respectively ((https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3310665/)).  In 2016, 66 cases had been reported by 7 Sep, with 12 deaths ((http://www.emro.who.int/afg/afghanistan-news/cchf-eid.html)). CCHF virus has been observed in over 30 countries, including in Africa (Democratic Republic of Congo, South Africa, Nigeria, Senegal, Uganda, Tanzania, Mauritania, Kenya), Asia (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, China), the Middle East (Iran, Iraq, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman), and southeastern Europe (the Russian Federation, Bulgaria, Albania, Kosovo, Turkey, Greece, and Spain) ((https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23458713)).  People most at risk of contracting CCHF include animal herders, livestock workers, butchers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Healthcare workers are also at risk of infection through unprotected contact with infectious blood and body fluids while caring for patients. There is no vaccine available for either people or animals, which means prevention is crucial. - Mod.UBA  Maps of Afghanistan can be seen at (http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/afghanistan_admin-2009.jpg) and (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1757). - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ  ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Costa Rica":{"45":{"title":"Zika virus (16): Americas, Asia, research,\r\n\tobservations ","date":["17","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Zika virus (16): Americas, Asia, research,\r\n\tobservations [EXTERNAL]","summary":"\nZIKA VIRUS (16): AMERICAS, ASIA, RESEARCH, OBSERVATIONS\n*\nA ProMED-mail post\n(http://www.promedmail.org)\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n(http://www.isid.org) In this update:\n<br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Cases in various countries:\nWHO tool kit for the care and support of people affected by\ncomplications associated with Zika virus \nAmericas\n\nAmericas cumulative case numbers\nCaribbean and South America Cases in various countries not mentioned above or more recent case\nnumbers.

Update: Interim guidance\nfor health care providers caring for pregnant women with possible Zika\nvirus exposure  United States (including US Territories), July 2017.\nMMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2017; 66(29): 781-93. doi:\n10.15585/mmwr.mm6629e1\n-\nCDC has updated the interim guidance for US health care providers\ncaring for pregnant women with possible Zika virus exposure in\nresponse to 1) declining prevalence of Zika virus disease in the World\nHealth Organization's Region of the Americas (Americas) and 2)\nemerging evidence indicating prolonged detection of Zika virus\nimmunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies. Zika virus cases were 1st reported\nin the Americas during 2015-2016; however, the incidence of Zika virus\ndisease has since declined. As the prevalence of Zika virus disease\ndeclines, the likelihood of false-positive test results increases. In\naddition, emerging epidemiologic and laboratory data indicate that, as\nis the case with other flaviviruses, Zika virus IgM antibodies can\npersist beyond 12 weeks after infection. Therefore, IgM test results\ncannot always reliably distinguish between an infection that occurred\nduring the current pregnancy and one that occurred before the current\npregnancy, particularly for women with possible Zika virus exposure\nbefore the current pregnancy. These limitations should be considered\nwhen counseling pregnant women about the risks and benefits of testing\nfor Zika virus infection during pregnancy. This updated guidance\nemphasizes a shared decision-making model for testing and screening\npregnant women, one in which patients and providers work together to\nmake decisions about testing and care plans based on patient\npreferences and values, clinical judgment, and a balanced assessment\nof risks and expected outcomes. For these recommendations, the definition of possible Zika virus\nexposure has not changed and includes travel to, or residence in an\narea with risk for mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission or sex with\na partner who has traveled to or resides in an area with risk for\nmosquito-borne Zika virus transmission. These areas can be found on\nthe CDC \"Zika Travel Information\" webpage. Key recommendations include the following:\n1- All pregnant women in the United States and US territories should\nbe asked about possible Zika virus exposure before and during the\ncurrent pregnancy, at every prenatal care visit. CDC recommends that\npregnant women not travel to any area with risk for Zika virus\ntransmission. It is also recommended that pregnant women with a sex\npartner who has traveled to or lives in an area with risk for Zika\nvirus transmission use condoms or abstain from sex for the duration of\nthe pregnancy.\n2- Pregnant women with recent possible Zika virus exposure and\nsymptoms of Zika virus disease should be tested to diagnose the cause\nof their symptoms. The updated recommendations include concurrent Zika\nvirus nucleic acid test (NAT) and serologic testing as soon as\npossible through 12 weeks after symptom onset.\n3- Asymptomatic pregnant women with ongoing possible Zika virus\nexposure should be offered Zika virus NAT testing 3 times during\npregnancy. IgM testing is no longer routinely recommended because IgM\ncan persist for months after infection; therefore, IgM results cannot\nreliably determine whether an infection occurred during the current\npregnancy. The optimal timing and frequency of testing of asymptomatic\npregnant women with NAT alone is unknown. For pregnant women who have\nreceived a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection (by\neither NAT or serology positive/equivocal Zika virus or dengue virus\nIgM and Zika virus plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) 10 and\nhigher and dengue virus PRNT less than 10 results) any time before or\nduring the current pregnancy, additional Zika virus testing is not\nrecommended. For pregnant women without a prior laboratory-confirmed\ndiagnosis of Zika virus, NAT testing should be offered at the\ninitiation of prenatal care, and if Zika virus RNA is not detected on\nclinical specimens, 2 additional tests should be offered during the\ncourse of the pregnancy coinciding with prenatal visits.\n4- Asymptomatic pregnant women who have recent possible Zika virus\nexposure (that is, through travel or sexual exposure) but without\nongoing possible exposure are not routinely recommended to have Zika\nvirus testing. Testing should be considered using a shared\npatient-provider decision-making model, one in which patients and\nproviders work together to make decisions about testing and care plans\nbased on patient preferences and values, clinical judgment, a balanced\nassessment of risks and expected outcomes, and the jurisdiction's\nrecommendations. Based on the epidemiology of Zika virus transmission\nand other epidemiologic considerations (such as, seasonality),\njurisdictions might recommend testing of asymptomatic pregnant women,\neither for clinical care or as part of Zika virus surveillance. With\nthe decline in the prevalence of Zika virus disease, the updated\nrecommendations for the evaluation and testing of pregnant women with\nrecent possible Zika virus exposure but without ongoing possible\nexposure are now the same for all areas with any risk for Zika virus\ntransmission.\n5- Pregnant women who have recent possible Zika virus exposure and who\nhave a fetus with prenatal ultrasound findings consistent with\ncongenital Zika virus syndrome should receive Zika virus testing to\nassist in establishing the etiology of the birth defects. Testing\nshould include both NAT and IgM tests.\n6- The comprehensive approach to testing placental and fetal tissues\nhas been updated. Testing placental and fetal tissue specimens can be\nperformed for diagnostic purposes in certain scenarios (e.g., women\nwithout a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection and\nwho have a fetus or infant with possible Zika virus-associated birth\ndefects). However, testing of placental tissues for Zika virus\ninfection is not routinely recommended for asymptomatic pregnant women\nwho have recent possible Zika virus exposure but without ongoing\npossible exposure and who have a live born infant without evidence of\npossible Zika virus-associated birth defects.\n7- Zika virus IgM testing as part of preconception counseling to\nestablish baseline IgM results for non pregnant women with ongoing\npossible Zika virus exposure is not warranted because Zika virus IgM\ntesting is no longer routinely recommended for asymptomatic pregnant\nwomen with ongoing possible Zika virus exposure. also at the source URL above:\nAdditional interim guidance:\n- Laboratory testing of pregnant women with exposure to areas with\nrisk for Zika virus transmission\n- Prenatal management of pregnant women with laboratory evidence of\npossible Zika virus infection\n- Evaluation of placental and fetal tissue specimens for Zika virus\ninfection \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org)\nand\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be)(promed@promedmail.org) Readers interested in accessing the full report can find it at the\nsource URL above.

Abstract\n\nImportance. There are no prospective cohort studies assessing the\nincidence and spectrum of neurologic manifestations secondary to Zika\nvirus (ZIKV) infection in adults.\nObjective. To evaluate the rates of acute ZIKV infection among\npatients hospitalized with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS),\nmeningoencephalitis, or transverse myelitis.\nDesign, setting, and participants. A prospective, observational cohort\nstudy was conducted at a tertiary referral center for neurological\ndiseases in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between 5 Dec 2015-10 May 2016,\namong consecutive hospitalized adults (older than 18 years of age)\nwith new-onset acute parainfectious or neuroinflammatory disease. All\nparticipants were tested for a series of arbovirosis. 3-month\nfunctional outcome was assessed.\nInterventions. Samples of serum and cerebrospinal fluid were tested\nfor ZIKV using real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain\nreaction and an IgM antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent\nassay. Clinical, radiographic (magnetic resonance imaging),\nelectrophysiological, and 3-month functional outcome data were\ncollected.\nMain outcomes and measures. The detection of neurologic complications\nsecondary to ZIKV infection.\nResults. 40 patients (15 women and 25 men; median age, 44 years\nrange, 22-72 years) were enrolled, including 29 patients (73\npercent) with GBS (90 percent Brighton level 1 certainty), 7 (18\npercent) with encephalitis, 3 (8 percent) with transverse myelitis,\nand 1 (3 percent) with newly diagnosed chronic inflammatory\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy. Of these, 35 patients (88 percent) had\nmolecular and/or serologic evidence of recent ZIKV infection in the\nserum and/or cerebrospinal fluid. Of the patients positive for ZIKV\ninfection, 27 had GBS (18 demyelinating, 8 axonal, and 1 Miller Fisher\nsyndrome), 5 had encephalitis (3 with concomitant acute neuromuscular\ndisease), 2 had transverse myelitis, and 1 had chronic inflammatory\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy. Admission to the intensive care unit was\nrequired for 9 patients positive for ZIKV infection (26 percent), and\n5 (14 percent) required mechanical ventilation. Compared with\nadmission during the period from 5 Dec 2013 - 10 May 2014 (before the\nBrazilian outbreak of ZIKV), admissions for GBS increased from a mean\nof 1.0 per month to 5.6 per month, admissions for encephalitis\nincreased from 0.4 per month to 1.4 per month, and admissions for\ntransverse myelitis remained constant at 0.6 per month. At 3 months, 2\npatients positive for ZIKV infection (6 percent) died (1 with GBS and\n1 with encephalitis), 18 (51 percent) had chronic pain, and the median\nmodified Rankin score among survivors was 2 (range, 0-5).\nConclusions and relevance. In this single-center Brazilian cohort,\nZIKV infection was associated with an increase in the incidence of a\ndiverse spectrum of serious neurologic syndromes.

However, the correlation between in\nvitro and in vivo findings is not well characterized. Thus, we\nevaluated the impact of heterotypic flavivirus immunity on ZIKV titers\nin biofluids of rhesus macaques. Animals previously infected (420 days\nor longer) with DENV2, DENV4, or yellow fever virus were compared to\nflavivirus-naïve animals following infection with a Brazilian ZIKV\nstrain. Sera from DENV-immune macaques demonstrated cross-reactivity\nwith ZIKV by antibody-binding and neutralization assays prior to ZIKV\ninfection, and promoted increased ZIKV infection in cell culture\nassays. Despite these findings, no significant differences between\nflavivirus-naïve and immune animals were observed in viral titers,\nneutralizing antibody levels, or immune cell kinetics following ZIKV\ninfection. These results indicate that prior infection with\nheterologous flaviviruses neither conferred protection nor increased\nobserved ZIKV titers in this non-human primate ZIKV infection model. Author summary\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne, emerging flavivirus. In\naddition to asymptomatic or mild febrile manifestations, ZIKV\ninfection in humans is associated with comparatively rare congenital\nand neurological abnormalities. Previous in vitro studies have\ndemonstrated cross-reactivity of antibodies derived from dengue virus\ninfections with ZIKV, as well as antibody-mediated enhancement of\ninfection in cell culture. Therefore, there is concern among\nvaccinologists and the public health community that the more severe\ndisease manifestations could result from prior immunity, either from\nnatural infection or vaccination, to antigenically-related\nflaviviruses (such as, dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis).\nIn this study, we evaluated the impact of prior immunity to dengue or\nyellow fever virus on ZIKV infection in a non-human primate model.\nAfter confirming that our immune cohorts were capable of\nrecapitulating the published in vitro observations of cross-reactivity\nand enhancement, we looked for alteration of viral titers in\nperipheral blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, and vaginal\nsecretions, as well as alterations in gross pathology, clinical\nparameters, and immune response, as compared to our flavivirus-naïve\ncohort. Importantly, no significant differences between\nflavivirus-naïve and primed animals were observed in viral titers or\nbiofluid distribution, neutralizing antibody levels, or immune cell\nkinetics following ZIKV infection. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org)\nand\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be)(promed@promedmail.org) Previous dengue infection, whether acquired naturally or antibody\nelicited by vaccines, has been a concern due to the possibility of\nantibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) with more severe disease. This\nconcern also relates to Zika virus antibody from vaccination for\nenhancement of dengue virus infections with resulting more severe\ndisease. The monkey studies reported above indicated that this may not\nbe a problem for Zika virus vaccinated individuals. Another effort to\navoid ADE is development of a vaccine that has epitopes specific for\nZika virus that are not shared by other flaviviruses.

ZIKV is also transmitted by\nsexual contact, although the relative importance of sexual\ntransmission is unclear. To better understand the role of sexual\ntransmission in ZIKV pathogenesis, a nonhuman primate (NHP) model of\nvaginal transmission was developed. ZIKV was readily transmitted to\nmature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by vaginal inoculation was\nreadily transmitted to mature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by\nvaginal individual RM with 1-5 vaginal inoculations required to\nestablish infection. After treatment with Depoprovera, a widely used\ncontraceptive progestin, 2 RM that initially resisted 8 vaginal ZIKV\ninoculations became infected after one ZIKV inoculation. Thus,\nDepoprovera seemed to enhance susceptibility to vaginal ZIKV\ntransmission. Unexpectedly, the kinetics of virus replication and\ndissemination after intravaginal ZIKV inoculation were markedly\ndifferent from RM infected with ZIKV by subcutaneous (SQ) virus\ninoculation. Several groups have reported that after SQ ZIKV\ninoculation vRNA is rapidly detected in blood plasma with vRNA less\ncommon in urine and saliva and only rarely detected in female\nreproductive tract (FRT) secretions. In contrast, in vaginally\ninoculated RM, plasma vRNA is delayed for several days and ZIKV\nreplication in, and vRNA shedding from, the FRT was found in all 6\nanimals. Further, after intravaginal transmission ZIKV RNA shedding\nfrom FRT secretions was detected before or simultaneously with plasma\nvRNA, and persisted for at least as long. Thus, ZIKV replication in\nthe FRT was independent of, and often preceded virus replication in\nthe tissues contributing to plasma vRNA. These results support the\nconclusion that ZIKV preferentially replicates in the FRT after\nvaginal transmission, but not after SQ transmission, and raise the\npossibility that there is enhanced fetal infection and pathology after\nvaginal ZIKV transmission compared to a mosquito transmitted ZIKV. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{10}</strong> _Aedes albopictus_ populations as vectors.\nDate: 2 Aug 2017.\nSource: American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (edited)\n(http://www.ajtmh.org/content/journals/10.4269/ajtmh.16-0969) \nref: Azar SR, Roundy CM, Rossi SL, et al.

Positive saliva samples were assayed for\ninfectious titer. Although all 3 mosquito populations were susceptible\nto all ZIKV strains, rates of infection, dissemination, and\ntransmission differed among mosquito and virus strains. _Aedes\nalbopictus_ from Salvador, Brazil, were the least efficient vectors,\ndemonstrating susceptibility to infection to 2 American strains of\nZIKV but failing to shed virus in saliva.

The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito\nbite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some\ncases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main\nvector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other\nmosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the\nvirus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit\nZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of\nlaboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_.\nInterestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the\nmidgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in\nRecife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially\nfed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced.\nCollectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range\nof ZIKV vectors than anticipated. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be) Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active\nvirus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their\nability to transmit that virus.

Given the\noutbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections in the region, and the\nclinical similarity of cases of that virus infection and CHIKV\ninfection, one wonders how many cases that were not laboratory\nconfirmed but clinically diagnosed as ZIKV infections were, in\nreality, CHIKV infections. It is also possible that a significant\nproportion of the population have been infected by CHIKV in the\nprevious 3 years and are now immune. It seems likely, however, that\nCHIKV is now endemic in the Americas, and sporadic, small outbreaks\nmay continue to occur as they do in Asia and Africa. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"297":{"title":"Dengue/DHF update (11): Americas","date":["28","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Dengue/DHF update (11): Americas","summary":"\nDENGUE/DHF UPDATE (11): AMERICAS\n\nA ProMED-mail post\n(http://www.promedmail.org)\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n(http://www.isid.org) In this update:\nCases in various countries:\nAmericas regional\n\nCases in various countries not mentioned above or more recent case\nnumbers.

In this month, 23 new infected carcasses were found,\nwhich is a downward trend from July 2017, when 68 reports were sent\nto the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). The 1st report of\nASF in Czech wild boars was on Wed 21 Jun 2017. Many neighbouring countries have alerted their local pig producers to\nbe very careful what to feed their pigs - and their inhabitants what\nto purchase and how to dispose of it. So did Slovakia, according to\nthe Slovak Spectator. Zlín is only a few km away from the western\nSlovak border, to its north is Poland where ASF has been around since\n2014 and on its eastern border is Ukraine, where ASF has been\nconfirmed since 2011. In a presentation, given in mid-July 2017 to the European\nCommission's Standing Committee On Animals, Plants, Food and Feed\n(SCoPAFF), Dr Petr Šatrán of the Czech State Veterinary\nAdministration indicated that human activities are most likely the\ncause of the spread of the virus, seeing that the nearest reported\ncases of ASF were roughly 500 km 310.68 mi away and that the\npositive dead wild boars were found in inhabited areas. In the other country where ASF was found for the 1st time in 2017,\nRomania, things appear relatively quiet. News broke early this month\nAugust 2017 that ASF was also found on 2 backyard farms in the north\nof the country. Ever since, the Romanian authorities did not report\nany further outbreaks of ASF to the OIE. Of all other countries in the European Union, especially Poland has\ncontinued to report outbreaks of African Swine Fever in smaller and\nmiddle-sized operations. In August alone, on 23 farm sites of various\nsizes, ASF was found to have infected at least one animal, after which\nthe entire herd would have to be culled. The biggest operation in this respect was a farm near Monki, Podlaskie\nprovince, where all remaining 431 pigs had to be culled after 11 had\ndied as a result of ASF, on Sat 19 Aug 2017. Noteworthy as well was\nthe ASF-related closure of 2 farms in Lack, Lubelskie province, in\nearly August. These farms had 136 and 141 pigs respectively see also\nitem 2.

This was said by Poland's Minister of Agriculture,\nKrzysztof Yurgel, Niezalezna reports. As reported, the length of the fence will be 729 km 452.98 mi,\ncosting Poland 130 million zloties (more than 36.2 million USD). The\nfinal decision on a fence will be made within the next 3 weeks. According to experts, ASF has developed in the territory of Poland\n\"thanks to\" the wild boars who entered from Belarus. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) The accumulated ASF OIE data from Poland as of Thu 31 Aug 2017, are\nas follows (start of event 22 May 2014):\nNumber of follow-up reports: 189\nTotal outbreaks: 550 (Submitted)\nSpecies/ Susceptible/ Cases/ Deaths/ Killed and disposed of/\nSlaughtered\nWild boar/ - / 620 / 620 / 0 / 0\nDomestic Swine/ 6303/ 402/ 188/ 6097/ 0 A map showing ASF cases reported globally to the OIE since 1 Jan 2017,\nas of Thu 31 Aug 2017, is available at (http://tinyurl.com/ybexasqm).\nClick on the European cluster, zoom in to each of the countries of\ninterest. EU disease control measures require designation of risk areas as Part\nI (wild boar at risk, but no cases found), Part II (wild boar testing\npositive but no spill over into domestic pigs), Part III (cases in\nwild boar and occasional spill over into domestic pigs) and Part IV\nwhich concerns the island of Sardinia only. Consignments of live pigs,\nlive wild boars, meat of either source and animal by-products of\neither source are only allowed under certain derogations. For a full\nexplanation, see European Commission Implementing Decision\n2014/708/EU. ASF, a viral disease against which no vaccine has become available so\nfar, is currently threatening central and western Europe, where dense\npopulations of wild boar are present. According to a recent update of DEFRA (UK) ASF situation assessment,\nthe continuing cases in the Czech Republic, the spread in Poland which\nappears to be due to several breakdowns in biosecurity and the new\noutbreaks in Romania are \"concerning\". This signifies a spread in\ngeographic distribution, a possible drop in biosecurity awareness and\ntherefore an increase in the weight of infection in East Europe. Despite the relatively low level of trade in live pigs, there could be\na substantial movement of people, vehicles and personal imports of\npork products, therefore the risk of ASF introduction to the UK has\nbeen raised from \"very low\" (that is, \"rare but could occur\") to\n\"low\". The Russian veterinary watchdog Rosselkhoznadzor believes ASF will\nkeep moving west via 2 main pathways. The southerly route, has already\nseen the virus spread from Ukraine to Moldova. Russian vets believe it\ncould penetrate central Romania, then move to the Balkans, including\nBulgaria and Serbia. On the northern route, now that ASF has been found in the Czech\nRepublic, Rosselkhoznadzor believes, if it gains a foothold, it is\nlikely to head further west, with Germany next in the firing line. The\nsaid is included in a recent update by the Russian journalist\nVladislav Vorotnikov, available at\n(http://www.pig-world.co.uk/comment/where-next-for-african-swine-fever.html).\n- Mod.AS ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Denmark":{"130":{"title":"E. coli EHEC - Australia: (QL) O157, mild disease, mutant\r\n\ttoxin, 2013 ","date":["29","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH/EDR> E. coli EHEC - Australia: (QL) O157, mild disease, mutant\r\n\ttoxin, 2013 [EXTERNAL]","summary":" A ProMED-mail post (http://www.promedmail.org) ProMED-mail is a program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases (http://www.isid.org) .

Source: Emerg Infect Dis Volume 23, Number 10October 2017 (edited) (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/10/16-1836_article)   Mild Illness during Outbreak of Shiga Toxin-Producing _E. coli_ O157 Infections Associated with Agricultural Show, Australia \n Shiga toxin producing _E. coli_ (STEC or enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_, EHEC - Mod. LL) is a major cause of serious human gastrointestinal illness and have the potential to cause life-threatening complications, such as hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) (1). An average of 0.4 cases of EHEC illness per 100 000 persons per year are reported to public health authorities in Australia (2). Disease severity can range from asymptomatic infection to serious and sometimes fatal illness, particularly in young children and the elderly (3,4).  Healthy ruminants, particularly cattle, are the reservoir for EHEC (5). Human infection with EHEC usually occurs as a result of inadvertent ingestion of fecal matter after consumption of contaminated food, water, or unpasteurized milk; contact with animals or their environments; or secondarily, through contact with infected humans (4,5). In the largest previously reported outbreak of EHEC illness in Australia in 1995, which was associated with consumption of mettwurst (uncooked, semidry, fermented sausages), HUS developed in 23 of the 51 case-patients identified, and there was 1 death (6).  The Study  A multidisciplinary incident management team was established to investigate an outbreak of EHEC illness associated with an annual agricultural show in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, in August 2013. The incident management team defined primary and secondary outbreak cases. Persons with laboratory-confirmed EHEC infection associated with the outbreak and their household contacts were followed up until the point of microbiological evidence of clearance, which was defined as 2 consecutive negative stool samples collected more than 24h apart (7).  Case-patients and contacts with a high risk for transmission (persons under 5 years of age; persons unable to maintain good hygiene; or childcare, healthcare, aged care, or food preparation workers) were advised to avoid childcare and work settings in accordance with Queensland Health Guidelines (7). Enhanced surveillance measures were implemented to assist with case finding. Medical practitioners were requested to avoid use of antimicrobial drugs for suspected case-patients with EHEC infections because of previously reported associations between antimicrobial drug use and HUS. We developed a case-control study to obtain additional information related to animal contact, hand hygiene, and food consumption at the agricultural show. We analyzed data by using Epi Info 7 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA). EHEC identified from human, environmental, and animal samples were serotyped for O and H antigens. Expression of Shiga toxin 1 (stx1) and stx2 genes was determined for selected isolates. Shiga toxin gene subtyping and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis was performed.  During 21 Aug 2013 to 27 Sep 2013, we identified 57 outbreak-associated laboratory-confirmed case-patients with EHEC infection: 54 confirmed primary case-patients, 1 probable primary case-patient, and 2 secondary case-patients (Figure 1 for figures, see original URL - Mod. LL). Of the 57 cases-patients, 32 (56 percent) were female. Case-patients ranged in age from 1 to 77 (median 9) years; 31 (56 percent) case-patients were (10 years of age. Median incubation period after attending the agricultural show was 4 (range 1-11, 25th-75th percentile 3-5) days. Case-patients reported diarrhea (96 percent), abdominal pain (93 percent), bloody diarrhea (41 percent), and fever (32 percent) (Table 1). A total of 7 case-patients were hospitalized. No cases of HUS or deaths were reported.  Public Health Units followed up 40 case-patients until microbiological evidence of clearance; the remaining case-patients were lost to follow up. Median duration of EHEC excretion among primary case-patients was 18 (range 2-52) days (Table 2). After 27 days and 6 recurrent stools positive for EHEC, and after acute diarrheal illness had resolved, 1 child was given azithromycin on day 40 for 3 days to hasten decolonization. 2 consecutive stool specimens obtained more than 48 h after treatment with antimicrobial drugs was stopped were negative for EHEC in this child. This patient did not have any adverse effects from azithromycin treatment.  A total of 45 of 55 primary case-patients and 28 household contacts who attended the agricultural show were included in the case-control study. Median age of case-patients was 8 (range 1-77) years, and median age of controls was 38 (range 1-70) years. We showed by using univariate analysis that case-patients were not more likely than controls to have entered the animal nursery at the show. Case-patients were more likely than controls to have had contact with lambs or goats, fed the animals, or had their hands licked by animals.  We identified the same multilocus variable number tandem repeat and stx subtype genotype of _E. coli_ O157:H- in human case-patients, animal bedding from the animal nursery before disposal, and fecal samples collected from lambs, goats, and calves. WGS and read mapping to an _E. coli_ O157 reference genome showed that of the human, animal, and environmental isolates analyzed, all contained an IS1203v insertion that resulted in deletion of the first 494 bp of the stx2c subunit A gene (Figure 2). Expression of stx2 was not detected in these isolates by Immunocard STAT! EHEC (Meridian Bioscience, Cincinnati, OH, USA) and Shiga toxin Quik Chek (Alere, Waltham, MA, USA) lateral flow devices. No additional stx2 genes were identified, and no disruptions were detected in the stx1 gene regions of any of the isolates.  Conclusions  We found that EHEC infection was associated with feeding lambs or goats, feeding animals, and having the hands licked by animals. The course of _E. coli_ O157 infection was relatively mild; no cases of HUS were associated with this outbreak. Heiman et al. found that of 4928 cases of 390 _E. coli_ O157 illness outbreaks in the USA during 2003-2012, HUS was detected in 299 cases (6 percent of illnesses) (8). HUS cases with stx1+/stx2 _E. coli_ O157 isolates have been reported (9,10). We speculate that the absence of severe complications in this outbreak might have been caused, in part, by disruption of the stx2 subunit A gene by the IS1203v insertion, which resulted in lack of expression or a nonfunctional Stx2 toxin.  The proportion of case-patients reporting bloody diarrhea (19/46, 41 percent) was also lower than previously reported. Ethelberg et al. reported that 69 percent (56/81) of case-patients in Denmark infected with _E. coli_ O157 had bloody diarrhea (11). A recent retrospective cohort study reported that 61 percent (2027/3323) of symptomatic case-patients infected with _E. coli_ O157 Public Health England had bloody diarrhea. Bloody diarrhea was reported to be a risk factor for HUS (odds ratio 2.10; p = 0.001) (12). In the outbreak we studied, children under 5 years of age were less likely than older children and adults to report bloody diarrhea. EHEC infection should be actively considered for young children with non-bloody diarrhea who were exposed to potential sources of EHEC.  In this outbreak, 1 child was given azithromycin for 3 days to hasten decolonization some weeks after the acute diarrheal illness had resolved. Antimicrobial drugs are generally not recommended to hasten EHEC decolonization because of major associations with HUS (13). Recommendations to avoid high risk activities (such as childcare attendance) might place a major socioeconomic burden on EHEC carriers and their families. Further studies are required to assess whether WGS can provide useful information for safe administration of antimicrobial drugs for treatment of acute illness caused by EHEC, or when chronic shedding becomes established.  Our comprehensive study of a large outbreak _E. coli_ O157 illness, characterized by an IS1203v insertion disrupting the stx2c subunit A gene, showed mild clinical illness and an absence of HUS. Further characterization by virulence studies on isolates with this stx2c subunit A gene disruption might provide further insights into the mild illness caused by this strain.  References - 1.

(promed@promedmail.org)  ProMED reported on this outbreak in 2013 when it occurred. It may well be the case that the IS1203v insertion that resulted in deletion of the first 494 bp of the stx2c subunit A gene may have been the cause of milder illness. Regarding azithromycin use, azithromycin and the carbapenem antimicrobial class are among a small group of antibacterials that do not appear to precipitate a higher risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome. Azithromycin was used for late clearance of the EHEC here and I have had anecdotal experience doing the same thing in an asymptomatic chronic carrier of EHEC O157 without any adverse effects. - Mod.LL  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/285).

The isolate from the product was almost identical by\nwhole genome sequencing to isolates from 3 of 4 patients, whose food\nhistory in 3 of the patients identified the smoked salmon as the\nlikely source. The smoked salmon product was recalled from about 600 stores in\nDenmark and a limited number in Metro Poland. Up to 3 of the 4 patients had become ill in the same week in August\n2017 and the 4th had become ill in May 2017. One of the 4 patients has\ndied. All 4 patients had severe underlying disease. DSG consists of chains (fotex, Bilka, Netto, and Salling) with more\nthan 1400 stores in Denmark, Germany, Poland and Sweden. Refrigerated smoked salmon is a recognized potential source for\nlisteriosis, similar to other cold cut meats and non-heat treated\ncured smoked meats, being a ready-to-eat product that does not require\nfurther cooking before eating.

Nat Commun. 2017; 8(1):\n169. doi: 10.1038/s41467-017-00246-8\n-\nAbstract\n\nZika virus is present in urine, saliva, tears, and breast milk, but\nthe transmission risk associated with these body fluids is currently\nunknown. Here we evaluate the risk of Zika virus transmission through\nmucosal contact in rhesus macaques. Application of high-dose Zika\nvirus directly to the tonsils of 3 rhesus macaques results in\ndetectable plasma viremia in all animals by 2 days post-exposure;\nvirus replication kinetics are similar to those observed in animals\ninfected subcutaneously. 3 additional macaques inoculated\nsubcutaneously with Zika virus served as saliva donors to assess the\ntransmission risk from contact with oral secretions from an infected\nindividual. 7 naive animals repeatedly exposed to donor saliva via the\nconjunctivae, tonsils, or nostrils did not become infected. Our\nresults suggest that there is a risk of Zika virus transmission via\nthe mucosal route, but that the risk posed by oral secretions from\nindividuals with a typical course of Zika virus infection is low. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall It is good to learn that Zika virus transmission via mucosa is\nunlikely. It will be interesting to know if virus shedding in saliva\nis a common occurrence in infected humans. - Mod.TY \n<br><br><strong>{4}</strong> CDC guidance for pregnancy.\nDate: Mon 24 Jul 2017.\nSource: CDC.

Update: Interim guidance\nfor health care providers caring for pregnant women with possible Zika\nvirus exposure  United States (including US Territories), July 2017.\nMMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2017; 66(29): 781-93. doi:\n10.15585/mmwr.mm6629e1\n-\nCDC has updated the interim guidance for US health care providers\ncaring for pregnant women with possible Zika virus exposure in\nresponse to 1) declining prevalence of Zika virus disease in the World\nHealth Organization's Region of the Americas (Americas) and 2)\nemerging evidence indicating prolonged detection of Zika virus\nimmunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies. Zika virus cases were 1st reported\nin the Americas during 2015-2016; however, the incidence of Zika virus\ndisease has since declined. As the prevalence of Zika virus disease\ndeclines, the likelihood of false-positive test results increases. In\naddition, emerging epidemiologic and laboratory data indicate that, as\nis the case with other flaviviruses, Zika virus IgM antibodies can\npersist beyond 12 weeks after infection. Therefore, IgM test results\ncannot always reliably distinguish between an infection that occurred\nduring the current pregnancy and one that occurred before the current\npregnancy, particularly for women with possible Zika virus exposure\nbefore the current pregnancy. These limitations should be considered\nwhen counseling pregnant women about the risks and benefits of testing\nfor Zika virus infection during pregnancy. This updated guidance\nemphasizes a shared decision-making model for testing and screening\npregnant women, one in which patients and providers work together to\nmake decisions about testing and care plans based on patient\npreferences and values, clinical judgment, and a balanced assessment\nof risks and expected outcomes. For these recommendations, the definition of possible Zika virus\nexposure has not changed and includes travel to, or residence in an\narea with risk for mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission or sex with\na partner who has traveled to or resides in an area with risk for\nmosquito-borne Zika virus transmission. These areas can be found on\nthe CDC \"Zika Travel Information\" webpage. Key recommendations include the following:\n1- All pregnant women in the United States and US territories should\nbe asked about possible Zika virus exposure before and during the\ncurrent pregnancy, at every prenatal care visit. CDC recommends that\npregnant women not travel to any area with risk for Zika virus\ntransmission. It is also recommended that pregnant women with a sex\npartner who has traveled to or lives in an area with risk for Zika\nvirus transmission use condoms or abstain from sex for the duration of\nthe pregnancy.\n2- Pregnant women with recent possible Zika virus exposure and\nsymptoms of Zika virus disease should be tested to diagnose the cause\nof their symptoms. The updated recommendations include concurrent Zika\nvirus nucleic acid test (NAT) and serologic testing as soon as\npossible through 12 weeks after symptom onset.\n3- Asymptomatic pregnant women with ongoing possible Zika virus\nexposure should be offered Zika virus NAT testing 3 times during\npregnancy. IgM testing is no longer routinely recommended because IgM\ncan persist for months after infection; therefore, IgM results cannot\nreliably determine whether an infection occurred during the current\npregnancy. The optimal timing and frequency of testing of asymptomatic\npregnant women with NAT alone is unknown. For pregnant women who have\nreceived a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection (by\neither NAT or serology positive/equivocal Zika virus or dengue virus\nIgM and Zika virus plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) 10 and\nhigher and dengue virus PRNT less than 10 results) any time before or\nduring the current pregnancy, additional Zika virus testing is not\nrecommended. For pregnant women without a prior laboratory-confirmed\ndiagnosis of Zika virus, NAT testing should be offered at the\ninitiation of prenatal care, and if Zika virus RNA is not detected on\nclinical specimens, 2 additional tests should be offered during the\ncourse of the pregnancy coinciding with prenatal visits.\n4- Asymptomatic pregnant women who have recent possible Zika virus\nexposure (that is, through travel or sexual exposure) but without\nongoing possible exposure are not routinely recommended to have Zika\nvirus testing. Testing should be considered using a shared\npatient-provider decision-making model, one in which patients and\nproviders work together to make decisions about testing and care plans\nbased on patient preferences and values, clinical judgment, a balanced\nassessment of risks and expected outcomes, and the jurisdiction's\nrecommendations. Based on the epidemiology of Zika virus transmission\nand other epidemiologic considerations (such as, seasonality),\njurisdictions might recommend testing of asymptomatic pregnant women,\neither for clinical care or as part of Zika virus surveillance. With\nthe decline in the prevalence of Zika virus disease, the updated\nrecommendations for the evaluation and testing of pregnant women with\nrecent possible Zika virus exposure but without ongoing possible\nexposure are now the same for all areas with any risk for Zika virus\ntransmission.\n5- Pregnant women who have recent possible Zika virus exposure and who\nhave a fetus with prenatal ultrasound findings consistent with\ncongenital Zika virus syndrome should receive Zika virus testing to\nassist in establishing the etiology of the birth defects. Testing\nshould include both NAT and IgM tests.\n6- The comprehensive approach to testing placental and fetal tissues\nhas been updated. Testing placental and fetal tissue specimens can be\nperformed for diagnostic purposes in certain scenarios (e.g., women\nwithout a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection and\nwho have a fetus or infant with possible Zika virus-associated birth\ndefects). However, testing of placental tissues for Zika virus\ninfection is not routinely recommended for asymptomatic pregnant women\nwho have recent possible Zika virus exposure but without ongoing\npossible exposure and who have a live born infant without evidence of\npossible Zika virus-associated birth defects.\n7- Zika virus IgM testing as part of preconception counseling to\nestablish baseline IgM results for non pregnant women with ongoing\npossible Zika virus exposure is not warranted because Zika virus IgM\ntesting is no longer routinely recommended for asymptomatic pregnant\nwomen with ongoing possible Zika virus exposure. also at the source URL above:\nAdditional interim guidance:\n- Laboratory testing of pregnant women with exposure to areas with\nrisk for Zika virus transmission\n- Prenatal management of pregnant women with laboratory evidence of\npossible Zika virus infection\n- Evaluation of placental and fetal tissue specimens for Zika virus\ninfection \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org)\nand\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be)(promed@promedmail.org) Readers interested in accessing the full report can find it at the\nsource URL above.

This cohort study evaluated adult patients with new-onset\nparainfectious or neuroinflammatory disease for the presence of acute\nZika virus infection in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples\nusing molecular and serological testing. An increase in the incidence\nof Guillain-Barré syndrome and encephalitis was observed compared\nwith the period before the outbreak of the Zika virus.\nMeaning The Zika virus may be associated with a rapid increase in the\nincidence of life-threatening neurologic syndromes; serologic and\nmolecular testing using blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples can\nserve as an alternative diagnostic strategy. Abstract\n\nImportance. There are no prospective cohort studies assessing the\nincidence and spectrum of neurologic manifestations secondary to Zika\nvirus (ZIKV) infection in adults.\nObjective. To evaluate the rates of acute ZIKV infection among\npatients hospitalized with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS),\nmeningoencephalitis, or transverse myelitis.\nDesign, setting, and participants. A prospective, observational cohort\nstudy was conducted at a tertiary referral center for neurological\ndiseases in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between 5 Dec 2015-10 May 2016,\namong consecutive hospitalized adults (older than 18 years of age)\nwith new-onset acute parainfectious or neuroinflammatory disease. All\nparticipants were tested for a series of arbovirosis. 3-month\nfunctional outcome was assessed.\nInterventions. Samples of serum and cerebrospinal fluid were tested\nfor ZIKV using real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain\nreaction and an IgM antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent\nassay. Clinical, radiographic (magnetic resonance imaging),\nelectrophysiological, and 3-month functional outcome data were\ncollected.\nMain outcomes and measures. The detection of neurologic complications\nsecondary to ZIKV infection.\nResults. 40 patients (15 women and 25 men; median age, 44 years\nrange, 22-72 years) were enrolled, including 29 patients (73\npercent) with GBS (90 percent Brighton level 1 certainty), 7 (18\npercent) with encephalitis, 3 (8 percent) with transverse myelitis,\nand 1 (3 percent) with newly diagnosed chronic inflammatory\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy. Of these, 35 patients (88 percent) had\nmolecular and/or serologic evidence of recent ZIKV infection in the\nserum and/or cerebrospinal fluid. Of the patients positive for ZIKV\ninfection, 27 had GBS (18 demyelinating, 8 axonal, and 1 Miller Fisher\nsyndrome), 5 had encephalitis (3 with concomitant acute neuromuscular\ndisease), 2 had transverse myelitis, and 1 had chronic inflammatory\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy. Admission to the intensive care unit was\nrequired for 9 patients positive for ZIKV infection (26 percent), and\n5 (14 percent) required mechanical ventilation. Compared with\nadmission during the period from 5 Dec 2013 - 10 May 2014 (before the\nBrazilian outbreak of ZIKV), admissions for GBS increased from a mean\nof 1.0 per month to 5.6 per month, admissions for encephalitis\nincreased from 0.4 per month to 1.4 per month, and admissions for\ntransverse myelitis remained constant at 0.6 per month. At 3 months, 2\npatients positive for ZIKV infection (6 percent) died (1 with GBS and\n1 with encephalitis), 18 (51 percent) had chronic pain, and the median\nmodified Rankin score among survivors was 2 (range, 0-5).\nConclusions and relevance. In this single-center Brazilian cohort,\nZIKV infection was associated with an increase in the incidence of a\ndiverse spectrum of serious neurologic syndromes. The data also\nsuggest that serologic and molecular testing using blood and\ncerebrospinal fluid samples can serve as a less expensive, alternative\ndiagnostic strategy in developing countries, where plaque reduction\nneutralization testing is impractical. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) This study illustrates the need to consider post-Zika virus infection\nas a cause of a variety of neurological diseases.

PLoS\nPathog. 2017; 13(8): e1006487. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006487\n-\nAbstract\n\nStudies have demonstrated cross-reactivity of anti-dengue virus (DENV)\nantibodies in human sera against Zika virus (ZIKV), promoting\nincreased ZIKV infection in vitro. However, the correlation between in\nvitro and in vivo findings is not well characterized. Thus, we\nevaluated the impact of heterotypic flavivirus immunity on ZIKV titers\nin biofluids of rhesus macaques. Animals previously infected (420 days\nor longer) with DENV2, DENV4, or yellow fever virus were compared to\nflavivirus-naïve animals following infection with a Brazilian ZIKV\nstrain. Sera from DENV-immune macaques demonstrated cross-reactivity\nwith ZIKV by antibody-binding and neutralization assays prior to ZIKV\ninfection, and promoted increased ZIKV infection in cell culture\nassays. Despite these findings, no significant differences between\nflavivirus-naïve and immune animals were observed in viral titers,\nneutralizing antibody levels, or immune cell kinetics following ZIKV\ninfection. These results indicate that prior infection with\nheterologous flaviviruses neither conferred protection nor increased\nobserved ZIKV titers in this non-human primate ZIKV infection model. Author summary\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne, emerging flavivirus. In\naddition to asymptomatic or mild febrile manifestations, ZIKV\ninfection in humans is associated with comparatively rare congenital\nand neurological abnormalities. Previous in vitro studies have\ndemonstrated cross-reactivity of antibodies derived from dengue virus\ninfections with ZIKV, as well as antibody-mediated enhancement of\ninfection in cell culture. Therefore, there is concern among\nvaccinologists and the public health community that the more severe\ndisease manifestations could result from prior immunity, either from\nnatural infection or vaccination, to antigenically-related\nflaviviruses (such as, dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis).\nIn this study, we evaluated the impact of prior immunity to dengue or\nyellow fever virus on ZIKV infection in a non-human primate model.\nAfter confirming that our immune cohorts were capable of\nrecapitulating the published in vitro observations of cross-reactivity\nand enhancement, we looked for alteration of viral titers in\nperipheral blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, and vaginal\nsecretions, as well as alterations in gross pathology, clinical\nparameters, and immune response, as compared to our flavivirus-naïve\ncohort. Importantly, no significant differences between\nflavivirus-naïve and primed animals were observed in viral titers or\nbiofluid distribution, neutralizing antibody levels, or immune cell\nkinetics following ZIKV infection. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org)\nand\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be)(promed@promedmail.org) Previous dengue infection, whether acquired naturally or antibody\nelicited by vaccines, has been a concern due to the possibility of\nantibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) with more severe disease. This\nconcern also relates to Zika virus antibody from vaccination for\nenhancement of dengue virus infections with resulting more severe\ndisease. The monkey studies reported above indicated that this may not\nbe a problem for Zika virus vaccinated individuals. Another effort to\navoid ADE is development of a vaccine that has epitopes specific for\nZika virus that are not shared by other flaviviruses.

PLoS Pathog. 2017; 13(7): e1006537. doi:\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1006537\n-\nAbstract\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted virus that can cause\nsevere defects in an infected fetus. ZIKV is also transmitted by\nsexual contact, although the relative importance of sexual\ntransmission is unclear. To better understand the role of sexual\ntransmission in ZIKV pathogenesis, a nonhuman primate (NHP) model of\nvaginal transmission was developed. ZIKV was readily transmitted to\nmature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by vaginal inoculation was\nreadily transmitted to mature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by\nvaginal individual RM with 1-5 vaginal inoculations required to\nestablish infection. After treatment with Depoprovera, a widely used\ncontraceptive progestin, 2 RM that initially resisted 8 vaginal ZIKV\ninoculations became infected after one ZIKV inoculation. Thus,\nDepoprovera seemed to enhance susceptibility to vaginal ZIKV\ntransmission. Unexpectedly, the kinetics of virus replication and\ndissemination after intravaginal ZIKV inoculation were markedly\ndifferent from RM infected with ZIKV by subcutaneous (SQ) virus\ninoculation. Several groups have reported that after SQ ZIKV\ninoculation vRNA is rapidly detected in blood plasma with vRNA less\ncommon in urine and saliva and only rarely detected in female\nreproductive tract (FRT) secretions. In contrast, in vaginally\ninoculated RM, plasma vRNA is delayed for several days and ZIKV\nreplication in, and vRNA shedding from, the FRT was found in all 6\nanimals. Further, after intravaginal transmission ZIKV RNA shedding\nfrom FRT secretions was detected before or simultaneously with plasma\nvRNA, and persisted for at least as long. Thus, ZIKV replication in\nthe FRT was independent of, and often preceded virus replication in\nthe tissues contributing to plasma vRNA. These results support the\nconclusion that ZIKV preferentially replicates in the FRT after\nvaginal transmission, but not after SQ transmission, and raise the\npossibility that there is enhanced fetal infection and pathology after\nvaginal ZIKV transmission compared to a mosquito transmitted ZIKV. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{10}</strong> _Aedes albopictus_ populations as vectors.\nDate: 2 Aug 2017.\nSource: American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (edited)\n(http://www.ajtmh.org/content/journals/10.4269/ajtmh.16-0969) \nref: Azar SR, Roundy CM, Rossi SL, et al.

Positive saliva samples were assayed for\ninfectious titer. Although all 3 mosquito populations were susceptible\nto all ZIKV strains, rates of infection, dissemination, and\ntransmission differed among mosquito and virus strains. _Aedes\nalbopictus_ from Salvador, Brazil, were the least efficient vectors,\ndemonstrating susceptibility to infection to 2 American strains of\nZIKV but failing to shed virus in saliva.

The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito\nbite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some\ncases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main\nvector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other\nmosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the\nvirus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit\nZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of\nlaboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_.\nInterestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the\nmidgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_.

Corroborating our experimental data from artificially\nfed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced.\nCollectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range\nof ZIKV vectors than anticipated. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be) Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active\nvirus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their\nability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step\ntoward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_\nfed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in\nsaliva, implicating their ability to transmit it.

The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare is advising tourists to go to hospital if they develop a high fever or generalized rash after returning to Japan.  Although the World Health Organization verified that Japan has eliminated infections of endemic measles strains in 2015, group infections originating from people who contracted the disease abroad are spreading in the country. As of 6 Aug 2017, the number of patients reached 169 this year in Japan, already eclipsing the figure in the previous year.  About 4100 patients in Italy and around 6500 patients in Romania have already been confirmed as of August 2017 compared with about 860 and 2000, respectively, throughout 2016, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.  Symptoms of the highly contagious disease include runny nose, red and watery eyes, high fever, and rash. The virus is spread through coughing and sneezing and can cause complications such as pneumonia and can even result in death in one in 1000 patients, according to the ministry. The ministry recommends people traveling overseas to check their vaccination records and take an additional shot if they have only been vaccinated once.

Overall, 1344 cases were ascertained, 86 per cent (with available information) unvaccinated, including 146 (12 per cent) asylum seekers. Median age was 17 years (interquartile range: 4-29 years), 26 per cent were hospitalised and a 1 year old child died. Measles virus genotyping uniformly revealed the variant 'D8-Rostov-Don' and descendants. The virus was likely introduced by and initially spread among asylum seekers before affecting Berlin's resident population. Among Berlin residents, the highest incidence was in children younger than 2 years, yet most cases (52 per cent) were adults. Post-exposure vaccinations in homes for asylum seekers, not always conducted, occurred later (median: 7.5 days) than the recommended 72 hours after onset of the 1st case and reached only half of potential contacts. Asylum seekers should not only have non-discriminatory, equitable access to vaccination, they also need to be offered measles vaccination in a timely fashion, that is, immediately upon arrival in the receiving country.

Source: Romania Insider (edited) (https://www.romania-insider.com/measles-kills-iraqi-refugee/)   The ongoing measles outbreak keeps making victims in Romania. A 10 month old girl, who was a refugee from Iraq, became the 33rd person to die of the infection, reports local Digi24. The girl arrived in Romania on 7 Jul 2017 with her family, and the doctors diagnosed her with measles in August. They also discovered that the child was suffering from malnutrition and severe psychomotor retardation.  The measles outbreak is still a major problem in Romania, with more than 8900 cases reported across the country until 25 Aug 2017, including 33 deaths, according to data from the National Center for Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases (CNSCBT). Most deaths were registered in Timis (9), Dolj (7), and Arad (6) counties.  Measles is a highly contagious respiratory infection caused by a virus. It causes a total-body skin rash and flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough, and runny nose. According to information posted on WHO's website, the virus is highly contagious, spreading by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact, and direct contact with infected nasal or throat secretions. Unvaccinated young children pose the highest risk of measles and its complications, including death.  The Romanian Government adopted earlier this month August 2017 a draft bill on the organization and financing of population vaccination (https://www.romania-insider.com/romania-draft-bill-vaccination/). The project was sent to the Parliament for approval and could come into force in January 2018.  byline: Irina Marica   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Measles tends to be more severe in children who are malnourished, especially children who are also vitamin A deficient. And complications are commoner and more serious in malnourished children. Because of complications such as diarrhoea, measles may lead to failure to thrive. Infection with measles virus may lead to kwashiorkor or marasmus in children who are underweight at the time that they get infected. Therefore, measles may result in, or aggravate, malnutrition.

Date: Sat 26 Aug 2017. Source: News-Medical/Life Sciences (edited) (https://www.news-medical.net/news/20170826/New-study-highlights-role-played-by-demographics-in-the-spread-of-measles.aspx)   Even if the incidence of measles infection has decreased by at least 90 per cent worldwide since the introduction of the vaccine, measles is still one of the major causes of death in children among vaccine-preventable diseases. Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world.  A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries.  Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years.  \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\"  \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea\".  The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years 2 million DALYs since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln 13 million DALYs in the US, and 36-mln 36 million DALYs in Ethiopia.  \"Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,\" continues Prof Melegaro \"our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population. Tailoring immunization campaigns to achieve measles eradication goals is essential and currently, for some countries, this means considering also the role of unprotected adolescents and young adults.\"   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Reference - Trentini F, Poletti P, Merler S, Melegaro A.

This came about after 2\nkidney recipients in Taiwan were diagnosed with dengue 2 days after\nreceiving a kidney each from the same donor, said National Cheng Kung\nUniversity microbiology and immunology professor Dr Oscar Perng\nGuey-chuen. \"This indicates a potential risk,\" the Taiwan-based\nscientist said, adding that no dengue virus was detected in the\ndonor's blood. He said the donor contracted dengue in 2015 and in mid-2016, he died\nin an accident. His family donated his corneas, liver, heart, and\nkidneys. Both patients had the same strain of the dengue virus the\ndonor had in 2015 and one of the recipients died of dengue\nhaemorrhagic fever, he said. Asked where the virus could be hiding since it could not be detected\nin the blood, he said it was a question scientists are trying to\nanswer. Interestingly, those who received the donor's corneas, liver,\nand heart did not develop dengue, Dr Perng said on the sidelines of\nthe National Dengue And Arboviruses Infection Conference 2017\nyesterday 12 Aug 2017. He said although there was not enough\nevidence to show the virus came from the donor as the kidneys were not\ntested for dengue before the transplant, the same virus was found in\nthe patients' bodies after that. Dr Perng said his team had studied mice for dengue virus in the blood\ntestes, kidney, liver, spleen and brain, and found the virus present\nin the kidneys and brain. \"We believe the virus probably resided in\nthe kidneys and was not cleared by the body,\" he said, adding that the\nvirus could have been activated after transplant. He said this raised\nconcerns about asymptomatic people who are dengue carriers. Health Ministry deputy director, general Datuk Dr S Jeyaindran said\npatients with severe dengue would have better recovery if they were\ngiven colloids, a more concentrated fluid, at the early stage in fluid\nmanagement for dengue patients. Dr Jeyaindran, who was representing\nHealth Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam, said colloids may be\nintroduced at an earlier stage, instead of saline because it has not\nbeen successful in treating patients with severe dengue. He said more\nstudies will be conducted to find out at which stage the colloids\nshould be given. byline: Loh Foon Fong \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) - Air travel related spread of dengue.\nDate: Thu 3 Aug 2017.\nSource: Medical Xpress (edited)\n(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-08-air-responsible-dengue-asia.html) \nWhile the incidences of many other infectious diseases have declined\nover the past decade, the number of cases and outbreaks of dengue\nvirus have continued to increase. The spread of dengue to new areas is\nlikely due in large part to trends in air travel, researchers now\nreport in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Dengue virus affects as estimated 390 million people around the globe\neach year, and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild fever and\nheadache to severe low blood pressure. The virus has mostly caused\ndisease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, but a 2014\noutbreak in Japan broke that pattern. Overall, the geographic area\naffected by dengue has been growing in recent years. In the new work, Huaiyu Tian and Bing Xu, both of Beijing Normal\nUniversity, China, together with colleagues from the University of\nOxford and elsewhere analyzed the spread of dengue viruses in Asia\nfrom 1956 to 2015. They used 2202 genetic sequences of dengue viruses,\ncollected in 20 countries or regions of Asia over the 59 years, to\ndetermine how different strains were related. They also investigated\ntrends in air travel, maritime mobility, migration, and\nsocio-economics to determine what factors impact the spread of\ndengue. The spread of 3 different dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1, -2, and -3,\nis associated with air traffic more so than any other factors, the\ndata revealed. Air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India, the\nresearchers found, help seed dengue epidemics, while China, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, and Singapore help diffuse the virus to other Asian\ncountries. \"Future trends in global mobility could potentially accelerate the\nappearance and diffusion of DENV worldwide,\" the researchers say.\n\"Prevention and control of dengue epidemics requires a better\nunderstanding of its mode of geographic dissemination, especially for\ncountries in the tropics.\" Reference: Tian H, Sun Z, Faria NR, et al.

A young Italian adult was diagnosed with measles in Finland in June\n2017. During the stay in Finland and subsequent travel to Estonia, the\ncase exposed altogether several hundred persons to measles. As of Fri\n11 Aug 2017, 5 secondary cases of measles have been detected. As the\ninvestigation is still ongoing, we present here the preliminary\nfindings and implemented control measures regarding this cluster of\nmeasles. Description of the cluster\n\nIndex Case 1 was a young Italian adult who arrived in Finland on Sun\n11 Jun 2017 and attended an international camp in Finland from 12 to\n25 Jun 2017 (Figure 1 for Figures/Tables, see original URL -\nMod.LL). After developing fever and respiratory symptoms on Fri 16 Jun 2017\nand rash on Wed 21 Jun 2017, Case 1 was admitted to the hospital of\nCity A and was isolated and monitored because enterovirus infection or\nmeasles was suspected. Serum and throat specimens were taken on Thu\n22 Jun 2017. While the confirmatory laboratory results were still\npending, the case was discharged and returned to the camp premises on\nSat 24 Jun 2017. On Sun 25 Jun 2017, Case 1 traveled to Helsinki\nby train (without a designated seat, 3.5 hours) and to Tallinn by\nferry (no cabin booked, 2.5 hours), staying one night before flying\nback to Italy. On Tue 27 Jun 2017, Case 1 was laboratory-confirmed\nfor measles infection. The case self-reported to be vaccinated with 2\ndoses of measles-containing vaccine; however, the laboratory results\ncontradicted this as the case tested negative for measles-specific IgG\nantibodies (Table). Subsequently, 5 secondary cases of measles were identified (Figures 1\nand 2). 4 of them were laboratory-confirmed (Cases 2, 4, 5 and 6).\nCase 3 was classified as a probable case (no laboratory testing\nbecause of parental objection). Cases 2 and 3 were adolescent siblings\nliving in City A. Both attended a summer camp organized at the same\npremises as the international camp. Both were placed in home\nisolation. Case 4 was a person working in a cafeteria in City B who\nhad visited the camp premises on Mon 19 Jun 2017. Cases 2, 3 and 4\nhad lunch in the same canteen used by other camp attendees including\nCase 1. Epidemiological investigations for Case 5 are still ongoing\nbut so far no link between other cases has been established. It is\npossible that there is an unknown case in the transmission chain. Case\n6 was a close contact of Case 5, identified during contact tracing.\nThe case had been vaccinated with 2 doses of the measles-mumps-rubella\n(MMR) vaccine in childhood; all other secondary cases were\nunvaccinated (Table). Laboratory findings\n-\nHealthcare providers were asked to send all clinical samples from\nsuspected measles cases to the measles reference laboratory of the\nFinnish National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL). Measles\nsequences available for 5 cases were identical and genotyped as D8\n(Table). Based on the Measles Nucleotide Surveillance database, this\nstrain was identical to strains isolated in Italy during 2017 and to a\nstrain identified in a British traveler, and it shared very high\nnucleotide similarity () 99.78 percent) with more than 600 sequences\ndetected on 5 continents between 2015 and 2017, indicating recent\nglobal spread of nearly identical measles viruses 1,2. 6 suspected\ncases were discarded after laboratory analysis. In addition, 3\npotentially exposed, asymptomatic people tested negative for measles. Conclusion\n\nIn Finland, a country with nationally high MMR vaccination coverage,\nextensive outbreaks of measles are unlikely to occur. However,\ntransmission chains among unimmunized individuals linked to an\nimported case are possible. A prompt response and the cooperation of\nhealth authorities, the media and possible other stakeholders are\ncrucial to interrupt transmission chains as soon as possible. Ensuring\nuniversally high vaccination coverage is essential to prevent clusters\nand outbreaks in the future. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) The full report can be found at the source URL. - Mod.ML \n<br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Italy.\nDate: Thu 17 Aug 2017.\nSource: Eurosurveillance 2017;22(33) (edited)\n(http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=22858) \nOngoing large measles outbreak with nosocomial transmission in Milan,\nnorthern Italy, March-August 2017\n\nAmendola A, Bianchi S, Frati ER, Ciceri G, et al. A large measles outbreak has been ongoing in Milan and surrounding\nareas, a densely populated area with nearly 4 million inhabitants.\nRapid and active surveillance was set up by the Subnational Reference\nLaboratories (SRL) Milan, established as part of the measles and\nrubella surveillance network MoRoNet <br><br><strong>{1}</strong> in March 2017, with 303\ninvestigated cases at the time of submission of this report. We\npresent a detailed analysis of the period 1 Mar 2017 to 30 Jun 2017,\nwith the aim to conduct a complete and rapid characterization of\nwild-type measles virus (MV) strains circulating. Confirmation and investigation of cases and clusters in Milan\n\nFrom 1 Mar to 30 Jun 2017, 233 suspected cases of measles were\ninvestigated: there were 203 (87 percent) laboratory-confirmed cases\n(median age: 30 years; range: 2 months-77 years) and 30 (13 percent)\nwere discarded. Overall 60 percent (n = 121) of the confirmed\ncases were individuals aged 15-39 years and 6 percent (n = 12)\nwere ≤ 1 year of age; 88 percent (n = 179) were not\nvaccinated and 12 percent (n = 24) were vaccinated (6 with 2 doses\nof measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, 10 with one dose, and 8 did\nnot know the number of doses). According to the epidemiological\nregional database, 108 of 203 were sporadic cases and 95 were related\nto 47 clusters. Cases were classified as sporadic when an\nepidemiological link to other cases could not be established. Molecular surveillance for cases and clusters\n\nThe genotype of MV strains was successfully identified in 187 of 203\n(92 percent) of the confirmed cases by sequencing the highly variable\nregion of nucleoprotein (N) gene (N-450) <br><br><strong>{2}</strong>. Phylogenetic analysis\nrevealed that the MV strains belonged to genotypes D8 and B3. The most\ncommon genotype detected was genotype D8 (86 percent; 160/187 cases)\nwhich was related to 77 cases in 42 clusters and 83 sporadic cases.\nAll of the D8 cases and clusters were autochthonous or from unknown\nsource. In March 2017, the B3 genotype was detected in 5 imported cases: 2\nsporadic cases and 3 cases which subsequently caused 3 import-related\nclusters. From Apr 2017 to end of Jun 2017, a further 14 autochthonous\nsporadic cases and one cluster were reported. The geographical and\ntemporal distribution, respectively, of sporadic cases and clusters\nrelated to D8 and B3 genotypes are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2 for\nFigures, see original URL - Mod.LL. Measles virus genotype D8\n\nPhylogenetic analysis showed that all the D8 sequences (n = 160)\nfell into the Osaka lineage (MVi/Osaka.JPN/29.15; similarity range:\n99-100 percent). From March to May, D8 MV strains mainly caused\nclusters in work and family settings, which occurred principally in\nthe north-eastern area of Milan. During the week starting on Mon 27\nMar 2017, a serious family cluster affected 3 cases causing the death\nof one of them. The D8 MV strain was isolated from the biological\nsamples of one of these cases. In Jun 2017, the D8 Osaka variant spread through the city of Milan and\ncaused a nosocomial cluster in a hospital. Based on epidemiological\ndata, a link was established between 12 cases: 8 healthcare workers\n(HCWs), 3 patients and one visitor. Phylogenetic analysis showed that\nthe 9 sequences obtained were 100 percent identical. The match of\nepidemiological data and phylogenetic analysis highlighted a single\ntransmission chain for all cases (Figure 3). Measles virus genotype B3\n\nPhylogenetic analysis showed that all B3 sequences (n = 27) were\nidentical to the variant Dublin (MVs/Dublin.IRL/8.16; similarity: 100\npercent) which is circulating in European countries and responsible\nfor an ongoing epidemic in Romania <br><br><strong>{3}</strong>. The B3 Dublin variant was 1st\nintroduced in the east of Milan at the beginning of March 2017, and\nthere was an epidemiological link to the Roma community in France. By\nthe end of March 2017, this variant was detected in a sporadic case\nreturning from Piedmont (northern Italy). Subsequently, the same\nvariant was isolated in a cluster caused by an index case returning\nfrom the Apulia Region (southern Italy) and in a cluster that was\nimported from Romania. In April 2017, genotype B3 was identified in a\nsporadic case returning from the Lazio Region (central Italy). During May 2017 and June 2017, 12 autochthonous cases were notified in\nthe eastern and south-eastern suburbs of Milan. In June 2017, 3\nnosocomial clusters were identified in an emergency department.\nAlthough initially reported as unrelated clusters, the phylogenetic\nanalysis showed a single source of transmission (n = 7, 2 HCWs, 4\npatients, and one visitor) (Figure 3). Conclusions\n\nEliminating measles and rubella is a core goal of World Health\nOrganization European Region Member States. Effective surveillance is\nessential for eliminating measles and rubella and its verification\n<br><br><strong>{4}</strong>. Since the beginning of 2017 and up to Sun 6 Aug 2017, the\nItalian Ministry of Health has reported 4087 cases of measles and 3\ndeaths. Most cases occurred in Piedmont and Lombardy (northern Italy),\nTuscany, Lazio and Abruzzo (central Italy) and Sicily (southern\nItaly). Most were older than 15 years (median age: 27 years) and 89\npercent of the cases were not vaccinated. Overall, 42 percent of the\ncases were hospitalized and 277 cases were reported among HCWs <br><br><strong>{5}</strong>. Timely measles surveillance is critical to disease control.\nIdentifying and confirming suspected measles cases through\nsurveillance allows early detection of outbreaks and analysis of\nongoing transmission in order to mount more effective vaccination\nmeasures. MV genotyping can play an important role in tracking\ntransmission pathways during outbreak investigations <br><br><strong>{6}</strong>. From March to June 2017, the genotypes D8 and B3 co-circulated in\nMilan and surrounding areas. The most common genotype detected was\ngenotype D8, related to 83 sporadic cases and 42 clusters. The high\nsimilarity between the D8 MV strains, all belonging to the Osaka\nlineage, suggests a unique initiating transmission event. This is the\n1st evidence of the Osaka D8 variant in northern Italy, which seems to\nbe replacing the D8 variants that had been circulating in this area\nsince 2013 7,8. Moreover, our data show multiple imported cases of\nB3 MV strains which subsequently spread across Italy and caused\nseveral autochthonous cases and clusters. The B3 Dublin variant has\nreplaced the B3 variant Como that had been present in this Italian\narea from August 2015 to November 2016 <br><br><strong>{9}</strong>. By the end of June 2017, D8 MV strains and B3 MV strains had caused\nclusters in 2 major Milanese hospitals. In August (current month)\n2017, the epidemic is still ongoing and the number of notified cases\nduring the month of July was almost twice the number of cases notified\nin June 2017. Other authors have already reported that where there\nis evidence of both nosocomial and community transmission of measles,\nnosocomial transmission appeared to precede community transmission\nwith a peak of hospital-acquired cases occurring almost 2 weeks before\nthe peak of the community outbreak <br><br><strong>{10}</strong>. In conclusion, the suboptimal immunization level (92.5 percent\nvaccination coverage rate in Lombardy Region; <br><br><strong>{11}</strong>) and the consequent\naccumulation of susceptible population have led to an increase in the\ntransmission of measles in northern Italy with detrimental effects on\nboth public health and ongoing measles elimination efforts.\nFurthermore, the nosocomial outbreaks highlight the importance of\nimproving measles vaccination coverage of healthcare workers.

Measles vaccination coverage is suboptimal in Italy (ranging between\n85.4 percent and 90.6 percent for one dose during the period\n2007-2016) <br><br><strong>{1}</strong>, which has led to large pockets of susceptible adults.\nWe describe an outbreak in an Italian hospital between February and\nApril 2017 among healthcare workers (HCW), hospital support personnel\n(hospital workers in activities not involving direct contact with\npatients), hospital visitors and community contacts. This outbreak was\npart of a wider epidemic in Italy that started in January 2017 and\nhas, as at Sun 30 Jul 2017, led to 4001 cases nationwide (275 in\nHCW) <br><br><strong>{2}</strong>. Outbreak description\n\nA HCW was referred to the emergency department (ED) of an Italian\nhospital for a rash developed after taking antibacterials for a mild\ncough and coryza. The rash was considered an allergic reaction to the\nantibacterial and the HCW was admitted to the hospital inpatient\nclinic. Three days later, the HCW's child was admitted to hospital for\na rash diagnosed as due to a non-communicable systemic disease. Subsequent serology showed that both the HCW and the child had\nmeasles. The origin of the infection for the index case is still\nunknown. It should be noted, however, that at least 10 community cases\nof measles occurred in the same period in the area of residence of the\nHCW. Using the standard case definition of the European Commission <br><br><strong>{3}</strong>, a\ntotal of 34 measles cases during the following weeks were identified\nby tracing the contacts of the index case. Among them, 15 were HCWs, 5\nwere support personnel, 4 were hospital visitors and 11 were community\ncontacts of the above cases. The secondary cases to the index (n = 8) occurred in 2 of the\nHCW's relatives, in 4 other HCWs, and in 2 support workers who were\nnot immediately recognized as belonging to the hospital outbreak. One\nof the secondary cases, a HCW, was in service until the onset of\nsymptoms, accessing all rooms on 2 inpatient wards. Tertiary cases\n(n = 6) involved the family of this HCW, 3 HCWs and a member of\nsupport personnel. A total of 2 weeks after the admission of the index case, 2 of the\nHCWs belonging to tertiary cases presented during the night to the ED\nwhere they stayed for nearly 10 hours. An additional 15 cases could be\ntraced following this single exposure window, namely 7 HCWs, 2 support\nworkers, 3 relatives of theirs and 3 visitors to the ED during the\ntime the 2 HCWs were present. One more community case was related to\ncontact outside hospital with one of the tertiary HCW cases.\nAdditional cases were related to a visitor at one of the involved\ninpatient wards, who probably got in contact with one of the tertiary\ncases who were HCW during the incubation period and generated 3 cases\nin the community, among them a family pediatrician. Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the epidemic curve and the outbreak tree\nfor figures, see original URL - Mod.LL. Characteristics of cases\n-\nUp to 6 cases occurred in children up to 9 years of age, while 2\noccurred in adolescents between 10 and 17 years and the majority of\ncases (n = 27) in adults 18 years and older. Figure 3 describes\nthe age distribution among different categories of cases. Vaccination status was known for 24 cases. Sixteen were unvaccinated\n(2 children, 14 adults), 2 had received one dose, one a full course of\n2 doses, and 5 cases occurred in contacts who received one dose of\npost-exposure vaccination. Of the 5 contacts who received post\nexposure vaccine, one was an infant younger than one year for whom\ninformation about the date of vaccination is not available; for the\nother 4, the delay between presumed contact date and immunization was\n3 days in 2 cases, 6 and 12 days for the remaining 2 cases. Among the\nHCWs, 2 were vaccinated, 11 were unvaccinated and for 2 of them the\ndata was unavailable. Among the 5 cases belonging to support personnel\n2 were unvaccinated and the status was unknown for the remaining 3. Genotyping was available for 3 cases: genotype B3, subtype 3.1 was\nfound in all of them. Conclusion and recommendations\n\nMeasles elimination in Europe, despite the immunization efforts, is\nstill jeopardized by recurrent outbreaks in susceptible populations\n4-7. Nosocomial transmission of measles is an important and emerging\nway of spreading the infection 8-11. Anyone staying in the hospital\nenvironment, regardless of role, can be affected because measles is\nhighly contagious and persists in the environment for up to 2 hours,\nthus requiring appropriate and timely infection control measures\n12,13.\nConsidering that transmission may occur 3 days before the onset of\nrash, early diagnosis when only non-specific preliminary symptoms\n(cough, coryza and conjunctivitis) are present is crucial for\ncontaining the outbreak <br><br><strong>{14}</strong>.\nA single exposure window, that occurred 2 weeks after the admission of\nthe index case, when 2 cases were present in the ED, resulted in\nfurther 15 cases. \nAppropriate procedures are needed for patients with suspect\ntransmissible infection in the ED, an issue not limited to measles but\nshared with several other highly infective conditions <br><br><strong>{13}</strong>.\nA 2-dose vaccination is the most effective measure to prevent measles\n<br><br><strong>{15}</strong>. This is of crucial importance for HCWs, with a view to their\nhigher risk of exposure and of transmission to vulnerable patients. However, it should be noted that in at least 5 cases in this outbreak,\nmeasles occurred in personnel working in the hospital environment in\nsupport functions, highlighting the need to take into consideration\nthe role of such personnel in the spread of the infection. Given that\nmost of the support personnel belong to outsourced services,\ncoordination is needed between occupational health unit and\noccupational health responsible of outsourced services. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) The full report can be found at the source URL. - Mod.ML There is no doubt that inadequate immunization levels are the major\ncontributor to outbreaks of measles. Most of this is due to not\nreceiving the 2 doses of vaccine due to personal or parenteral choice.\nAggressive programs to reverse this unfortunate trend are needed to\nprevent outbreaks of this potentially lethal disease. The nosocomial\nsetting as reflected in the 3rd post represents a special case\nsituation. It is not clear why health care workers are not required to\nbe immunized for measles. Additionally, when a case of measles is\nintroduced into a health care facility, it has been my experience that\nthe infection is not recognized promptly to minimize nosocomial\nspread. - Mod.LL  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at:\n(http://healthmap.org/promed/p/75).

Situation\n\nAs of 14 Aug 2017, 333 confirmed or probable HAV cases have been\nreported in an ongoing local outbreak in San Diego County. The cases\nhad symptom onsets between 22 Nov 2016 and 8 Aug 2017. 232 (70\npercent) of the cases have been hospitalized, and 11 patients (3\npercent) have died. The cases range in age from 19 to 87 years (median\n= 44 years), and 227 (68 percent) are male, with 2 (1 percent)\nself-identifying as men who have sex with men (MSM). 131 (39 percent) of the HAV cases are homeless and reported injection\nor non-injection illicit drug use, 53 (16 percent) were homeless only,\n36 (11 percent) were illicit drug users only, 76 (23 percent) were\nneither homeless nor drug users, and 37 (11 percent) had an unknown\nstatus for homelessness and drug use. Of the cases with test results\navailable for review, 58 of 262 (22 percent) have chronic hepatitis C\ninfection, and 15 of 261 (6 percent) have chronic hepatitis B\ninfection. Despite the fact that the majority of the cases in this outbreak had a\nknown indication for HAV immunization, only one case had been\nvaccinated prior to becoming infected: a 20-year-old who had routine\nHAV immunizations as a child. Most of the outbreak cases have been from the El Cajon/La Mesa area\nand downtown San Diego. Some cases have been confirmed in individuals\nwho were only in the southern or northern parts of the county during\ntheir exposure periods. There are several clusters of\nepidemiologically associated cases, although no specific common food,\nbeverage, or drug sources have been identified. Case clusters have\nbeen reported in individuals who have used the same homeless services\nproviders and in the following types of facilities with shared\nrestrooms: jails, single room occupancy hotels, residential drug\ntreatment facilities, and assisted living facilities. 3 healthcare\nworkers contracted HAV infection in this outbreak, as have four food\nhandlers, although no secondary cases have resulted from the\nindividuals working in these sensitive occupations. The CDC has confirmed HAV RNA in serum samples of 199 outbreak cases.\nViral sequencing indicates that 8 unique, closely related strains of\nHAV genotype 1B are involved. These strains are different than those\nassociated with an ongoing HAV outbreak in southeastern Michigan and\nthe outbreaks linked to frozen strawberries in 2016 and pomegranate\narils (seed pods) in 2013. The main outbreak strain in San Diego is\nidentical to one of the strains causing an ongoing HAV outbreak in\nSanta Cruz County. Investigations of the confirmed and probable cases, as well as 37\nsuspect cases, are ongoing. 19 HAV cases have been reported in 2017\nthat are travel-related and are not part of the local outbreak totals.\nOf note, 1 case was diagnosed with symptomatic HAV infection 4 weeks\nafter a trip to Paris, and viral sequence analysis indicated that the\nHAV strain causing his infection is identical to the one causing an\noutbreak among MSM in France. Background\n-\nPerson-to-person transmission through the fecal-oral route is the\nprimary means of HAV transmission in the USA. Most infections result\nfrom close personal contact with an infected household member or\nsexual partner, or their fecally contaminated environment. Hands may\nplay a significant role in the direct and indirect spread of HAV.\nCommonsource outbreaks and sporadic cases can also occur from exposure\nto fecally contaminated food or water. Individuals with increased risk for HAV infection include: travelers\nto countries with high or intermediate endemicity of HAV, MSM, users\nof injection and non-injection illicit drugs, persons with clotting\nfactor disorders, and persons working with nonhuman primates. HAV\noutbreaks have been reported among the homeless, who have a higher\nmorbidity and mortality when compared with the general population and\nan increased risk of infection due to living conditions. Individuals\nwith chronic liver conditions, such as hepatitis B or C, are also\nrecommended to get HAV vaccination because of their increased\nmorbidity and mortality risks should they contract HAV. Recommendations for providers\n\n1. Consider HAV infection in individuals, especially the homeless and\nthose who use illicit drugs, with discrete symptom onset and jaundice\nor elevated liver function tests.\n- Symptoms of concern include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia,\nfever, malaise, dark urine, light-colored stool, and abdominal pain.\n- A complete serology panel with testing for hepatitis A, B, and C is\nrecommended in symptomatic patients. HIV testing is also recommended\nfor those with an undocumented HIV-status.\n- Serologic testing for HAV infection is not recommended in\nasymptomatic individuals or as screening before vaccination. 2. Promptly report all confirmed and suspect HAV cases to the\nEpidemiology Program.\n- Please fax Confidential Morbidity Report (CMRa)\n(http://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/dam/sdc/hhsa/programs/phs/documents/CMRa.pdf),\nor call 619-692-8499 (Monday-Friday, 8 AM-5 PM), or 858565-5255 (after\nhours, during weekends, and on county-observed holidays).\n- Since this outbreak involves homeless individuals, providers are\nurged to contact the Epidemiology Program while suspected cases are\nstill at the healthcare facility. This action will ensure that a\npublic health investigator can interview the patient by phone for a\nrisk history and will facilitate serum specimen submission to the San\nDiego County Public Health Laboratory for possible genotyping. 3. Provide post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for close contacts of\nconfirmed HAV cases.\n- Susceptible people exposed to HAV should receive a dose of\nsingle-antigen HAV vaccine intramuscular (IM) immune globulin (IG)\n(0.1 mL/kg), or both, as soon as possible within 2 weeks of last\nexposure. The PEP dosage of IG was recently increased and is higher\nthan that noted in the package insert.\n- The efficacy of combined HAV/Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine\n(Twinrix®) for PEP has not been evaluated, so it is not recommended\nfor PEP.\n- Detailed information on PEP may be found on the CDPH California\nDepartment of Public Health Hepatitis A PEP Guidance Quicksheet\n(updated July 2017)\n(https://archive.cdph.ca.gov/programs/immunize/Documents/CDPH_HAV%20PEP%20Clinical%20Guidance.pdf)\nand the CDPH Hepatitis A PEP IG Administration Quicksheet (updated\nAugust 2017)\n(https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Immunization/HepatitisA-IGPEPGuidance.pdf). 4. Provide HAV vaccine to homeless individuals, illicit drug users,\npatients with chronic liver diseases, MSM, and other at-risk people\nwho are not already immunized, and to any individual who desires\nimmunity to HAV.\n- The 1st dose of single-antigen HAV vaccine (Havrix®, Vaqta®)\nappears to protect more persons than the 1st dose of the combined\nHAV/HBV (Twinrix®) vaccine, but efficacy is comparable after\ncompletion of the respective series. Providers should consider\nshort-term risks of exposure to HAV, the likelihood of follow-up to\ncomplete immunization, and the need for protection from HBV when\nselecting vaccines for those at risk. Immunization against HAV with\nexisting supplies should not be delayed to obtain a different\nformulation of vaccine.\n- Providers who do not have available vaccine may direct patients to\nan immunization clinic at the nearest County Public Health Center.\n-Providers who care for homeless individuals may contact the\nImmunization Program at 619-692-5607 (Monday-Friday, 8 AM-5 PM) to\nlearn how to obtain 317-funded HAV vaccine for use during this\noutbreak.\n- Homeless individuals and illicit drug users are also at higher risk\nfor other vaccine preventable diseases and should be brought\nup-to-date with recommended vaccines per the relevant CDC immunization\nschedule.\n- Providers should check the San Diego Immunization Registry to see if\npatients are already vaccinated and note any vaccinations given.\n- Some individuals who are at risk for HAV may be uncomfortable\ndisclosing the reasons that they are at risk to a provider, so the\nAdvisory Committee on Immunization Practices routinely recommends HAV\nvaccination \"for any person wishing to obtain immunity.\"\n- Adult HAV vaccination is covered by Medi-Cal without prior\nauthorization. 5. Provide HAV vaccination to individuals who have frequent, ongoing\nclose contact with homeless individuals and illicit drug users, and to\nall food handlers in San Diego County.\n- The County Public Health Officer recommends HAV vaccination for\nindividuals with ongoing, close contact with homeless and illicit drug\nusing individuals in San Diego County. This local recommendation is\nbeing made due to the current outbreak and includes persons working in\nhealth care, public safety, sanitation, homeless shelters, and\nhomeless and behavioral service provider agencies.\n- The County Public Health Officer recommends HAV vaccination for all\nfood handlers in San Diego County. This local recommendation is being\nmade to reduce the potential risk of an ill food handler transmitting\nHAV to others. 6. Encourage those who are planning an international trip to check the\nCDC Travelers' Health website and to obtain recommended vaccinations\nbefore travel.\n- High-risk areas for HAV include parts of Africa and Asia, and\nmoderate-risk areas include Central and South America, Eastern Europe,\nand parts of Asia.\n- There are currently HAV outbreaks associated with MSM occurring in\nNew York City and in Western Europe, notably France, Portugal, and\nSpain. MSM should be vaccinated against HAV, especially prior to\ntravel, and be instructed on prevention measures for HAV and other\nsexually transmitted illnesses. 7. Ensure that all healthcare workers use standard precautions in\npatient care to protect themselves against HAV. HAV, like norovirus,\nis a non-enveloped virus, and it may be similarly difficult to\ninactivate in the environment. Alcohol-based hand rubs and\ntypically-used surface disinfectants may not be effective. Therefore,\nadditional precautions to take include:\n- Wash hands with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds after\nproviding care for an HAV patient.\n- Use contact precautions, in addition to standard precautions, in the\ncare of diapered or incontinent HAV patients.\n- Wash hands with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds\nbefore eating and after using a restroom.\n- Use employee-designated restrooms when available, and do not touch\nthe door handle directly when exiting a restroom.\n- Do not eat in patient care areas and never share food, drink or\ncigarettes with patients.\n- Do not handle a cell phone just before (or while) eating. Studies\nhave shown that cell phones have high rates of surface contamination\nwith enteric organisms (and for hospital employees, organisms\nassociated with hospital acquired infections).\n- Perform environmental cleaning in areas housing HAV patients with\nbleach products or other products effective against norovirus.\n- HAV vaccine is recommended for unvaccinated healthcare workers\ncaring for HAV patients or individuals at risk for HAV. The vaccine\nshould be available and encouraged for other unvaccinated healthcare\npersonnel concerned about increased exposure to HAV. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nEric McDonald\nCounty of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency\nCalifornia\nUSA\n(eric.mcdonald@sdcounty.ca.gov) ProMED thanks Eric McDonald for this posting.

A more\ndetailed description of the case cohort is included in this report and\n66 percent had either homelessness and/or non-injection illicit drug\nuse as risk factors. At this point, there have been 11 deaths in the\ncohort but it is not clear if co-infection with either HBV or HCV is a\nrisk factor for death.

Among these cases there were 32 deaths, as follows: 8 in\nTimis County, 6 in Arad, 7 in Dolj, 3 in Caras-Severin, and one in\neach Bihor, Cluj, Calarasi, Satu Mare, Vaslui, Galati, Mures, and\nBucharest. Measles outbreaks have been registered in all 41 counties,\nthe most affected  with over 1000 cases each  being Timis (1215\ncases), Caras-Severin (1110), and Arad (1002). The measles outbreak in Romania in 2016 is not circumstantial, but a\ndirect consequence of the \"major\" malfunctions in public policy\nregarding vaccination, minister of health Florian Bodog stated on Fri\n11 Aug in a press release. \"For years now Romania has been below the\nsafety threshold of vaccination coverage. That is, the risk of a\nmeasles outbreak was imminent. Which is what actually happened. The\noutbreak of the measles epidemic in 2016 is not conjectural, it is a\ndirect consequence of major malfunctions in the public policy on\nvaccination,\" the minister of health stated. According to him, the Vaccination Law corrects the irregularities that\nled to the epidemic, providing the best conditions for protecting\nchildren's health. \"For Romania, the stake of the vaccination bill is\nhuge. Ensuring a healthy future for 4 million children lies in our\nhands. The Romanian parliament, the highest institution of democracy,\nwill decide on the final content of this law. However, beyond the\ndebates in parliament, it is important that all the public opinion be\ninformed and understand the true meaning of the law and the profound\nchanges it brings. (..) We have a moral duty towards our children, to\nprevent harm before it happens. As we also have a moral duty to the\ncommunity in which we live to prevent harm before it happens to other\nchildren or parents,\" Bodog said, quoted in the press release. He added that any bill is amendable and that is why it is open to any\npublic debates as long as they are carried out with honesty, good\nsense and decency. \"But this project is the day-to-day work of\nspecialists in the field of vaccination and who have faced all the\nflaws of the current framework. That is why the law has been carefully\nand correctly thought through by those who best understand how to\nregulate the vaccination policy,\" the minister of health also said. The bill on the organisation and funding of public vaccination in\nRomania was adopted by the government on Wed 9 Aug 2017. The bill\nwas submitted to parliament for debate and adoption. The normative act\nwould come into force on 1 Jan 2018. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) A similar report can be found in El Pais (12 Aug 2017) which states\nin addition that, of the 95 per cent vaccine coverage recommended by\nthe World Health Organization (WHO), 86 per cent have been\nvaccinated since 2007, according to its national epidemiological\ncentre. \"Highly worrying\" figures, acknowledged the prime minister,\nMihai Tudose, this week. \"More than 180 000 children in our country,\nfrom 9 months to 9 years, are not immunized against measles. In some\nregions, the rate of immunization of the 2nd dose does not reach 50\nper cent; and this is very serious.\" Timis and Caras-Severin, Arad\n(all to the west of the country, near the border with Serbia or\nHungary), are the most affected, with more than 1000 measles cases\neach, reported in the last 10 months when the outbreak was declared. According to official estimates, nearly 50 000 children without\nimmunization are not even registered with a family doctor. Most is due\nto serious problems of social exclusion.

The 6 people are now\nout of danger, and the 4 hospitalised patients were able to return\nhome, says the regional Agency of health (ARS), Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes,\ncited by France Bleu. These are all people who live or work in this\nsmall town of 1100 habitats. The ARS called for vigilance and prompted the inhabitants of the\nnorthern Ardèche, to consult a doctor in case of fever and appearance\nof buttons rash. It alerted on the very high contagiousness of the\nvirus that can infect up to 20 people around a sick person, and they\ncan produce severe, even life-threatening disease  in fact, there is\nno curative treatment for measles. In addition, the ARS has been reported to France Bleu that the recent\nconfirmed cases of measles in Ardoix were unvaccinated. According to\nthe figures of the LRA, 71 per cent of the inhabitants of the Ardèche\nregion are vaccinated against measles, which is 10 per cent less than\nthe national average. The government has confirmed its willingness to make mandatory 8\nvaccines, including measles. On this disease, \"Vaccination coverage\namong children at 2 years of age reaches only 78 per cent. As long as\nit does not reach the 95 per cent the risk of epidemic wave periodic\nwill persist\", has declared Agnès Buzyn. Measles has made its 1st victim in France at the end of July 2017.

The index case had just returned from visiting family in the Ukraine\nwhere he likely contracted the disease. When he returned to Israel he\nvisited a clinic where he infected 8 other soldiers who were waiting\nin line to see a physician. \"The IDF, together with the Health\nMinistry, carried out an investigation to locate the cases and\nidentify the source of the infection,\" the army said in a statement,\nadding that all those who had contact with the soldiers had been\ngiven preventative treatment. An IDF spokesman told The Jerusalem Post\nthat the soldier who contracted the disease had 2 stopovers in Europe\non his way back to Israel from the Ukraine but was not able to specify\nwhich countries. WHO in March 2017 warned of a measles outbreak sweeping across\nEurope in places where immunization rates have plummeted. The figures\ncover the agency's entire European region  53 countries including\nIsrael, Kazakhstan, and Russia. According to WHO 559 measles cases\nwere reported in Europe between January and March 2017. While the\nlargest current measles outbreaks in Europe were reported in Romania\nand Italy, other countries reporting cases were France, Germany,\nPoland, Switzerland, and the Ukraine. \"With steady progress toward\nelimination over the past 2 years, it is of particular concern that\nmeasles cases are climbing in Europe,\" said Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO\nregional director for Europe. \"Today's travel patterns put no person\nor country beyond the reach of the measles virus. Outbreaks will\ncontinue in Europe, as elsewhere, until every country reaches the\nlevel of immunization needed to fully protect their populations.\" Israeli children are routinely immunized with the MMR measles, mumps,\nrubella vaccine which are given in 2 doses, at 1 year and a booster\nin the 1st grade. The Health Ministry has stated that the level of\nvaccine coverage in Israel is among the highest in the West, with 97\nper cent coverage for 1st and 2nd doses MMR and chickenpox vaccine. While no vaccine is 100 per cent effective, an infectious disease\nspecialist told the Post that measles is \"a nasty illness\" that is\npreventable by proper immunization. But while it is highly recommended\nby medical professionals and the Health Ministry, the vaccine is not\nmandatory and according to the IDF the measles vaccine is not part of\nthe vaccines given to new recruits. \"We cannot afford to have soldiers\nwho are severely ill with a highly contagious disease. It would be\nappropriate for the IDF to verify and update immunizations of all\npersonnel and new recruits,\" the infectious disease specialist told\nthe Post. Measles is spread by coughing and sneezing and close contact with\ninfected individuals. While most infected people usually experience\nonly mild symptoms it is one of the leading causes of death among\nyoung children globally. Measles takes about 8-12 days following\ncontact before the individual will show symptoms which include a\nfever, bad cough, red eyes, and a runny nose. A few days after the\nrespiratory symptoms, the infected individual will get a bad rash.\nOther complications of measles include gastroenteritis (diarrhea and\nvomiting), pneumonia, severe bleeding problems, and in some rare cases\nencephalitis (brain infections). In June 2017, 5 cases of measles were reported to the Health\nMinistry  all of them women between the ages of 20-40 who lived in\nJerusalem. byline: Anna Ahronheim \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) Even with 97 per cent vaccine coverage, measles virus can cause small\noutbreaks.

Measles is an airborne disease that affects mostly children between\nthe ages of 6 months and 10 years, although it can also affect\nadults. Although Prof Mbonye said there was no cause for alarm, he urged the\npublic to be vigilant and report any suspected cases to the nearest\nhealth facilities. The public has also been urged to look out for\ncommon early symptoms associated with the disease, which include high\nfever, cough, red swelling eyelids and muscle and body irritability. According to the Ministry of Health, an estimated 20 per cent of\npeople who get infected with measles often develop complications,\nwhich if not managed early enough can lead to death. Despite previous\nmass vaccination campaigns, Uganda has had several outbreaks of the\ndisease. Prof Mbonye blamed it on parents who do not take their\nchildren for immunisation at the right time. Current national\nimmunisation coverage stands at 85 per cent. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) According to WHO, in 2016 global vaccination coverage (all vaccines)\nwas stalled at 86 per cent, with no significant changes during the\npast year. For measles alone, by the end of 2016, 85 per cent of\nchildren had received 1 dose of vaccine by their 2nd birthday, and 164\ncountries had included a 2nd dose as part of routine immunization; 64\nper cent of children received 2 doses of measles vaccine according to\nnational immunization schedules. It is generally thought that because\nmeasles is such a highly transmissible disease, that 90-95 per cent of\npeople must be vaccinated in order to protect the entire population,\nor achieve herd immunity.

Given the\noutbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections in the region, and the\nclinical similarity of cases of that virus infection and CHIKV\ninfection, one wonders how many cases that were not laboratory\nconfirmed but clinically diagnosed as ZIKV infections were, in\nreality, CHIKV infections. It is also possible that a significant\nproportion of the population have been infected by CHIKV in the\nprevious 3 years and are now immune. It seems likely, however, that\nCHIKV is now endemic in the Americas, and sporadic, small outbreaks\nmay continue to occur as they do in Asia and Africa. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"95":{"title":"Invasive mosquito - UK: (England) ","date":["23","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH> Invasive mosquito - UK: (England) [EXTERNAL]","summary":" A ProMED-mail post (http://www.promedmail.org) ProMED-mail is a program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases (http://www.isid.org) .

Source: Express (edited) (http://www.express.co.uk/news/nature/844891/Asian-mosquitos-Britain-Eurotunnel-dengue-fever-chikungunya-virus-UK)   Health specialists have blitzed a clutch of notorious Asian tiger mosquitoes suspected to have smuggled their way into Britain through the Eurotunnel. The invasive Asiatic mosquitoes can carry dengue fever and the chikungunya virus, and attack in daylight.  Experts from Public Health England destroyed the batch of mosquito eggs and larvae at the busy Ashford International truck stop earlier this month August 2017. This is the 2nd time that one of the planet's most dangerous insects  so-named because of its striped body and legs  has been discovered entering into the UK during the last year.  Asian tiger mosquitoes  scientific name, _Aedes albopictus_  have been spreading across Europe and are blamed for up to a million global cases of chikungunya globally every year. The disease has no cure and leaves victims in a fever and with excruciating joint pains as well as headaches, nausea and rashes. There is a death risk of one in a thousand cases. France confirmed 4 cases in 2014 and there was an epidemic in Italy a decade ago.  Asian tiger mosquitoes are spreading the disease through the way their eggs and larvae have been exported from native forest haunts in south east Asia in tyre imports. The grubs eggs can survive for months and larvae and pupae develop in small pockets of water retained by tyres.  To counter the threat, the authorities are maintaining a \"mosquito surveillance programme\" at 30 UK ports and airports as well as checks at motorway services on routes from south coast ports and Eurotunnel. Dr Jenny Harries, deputy medical director at Public Health England, said: \"Through these activities we identified a small number of eggs and larvae from the _Aedes albopictus_ mosquito in traps at Ashford International truck stop.  byline: Stuart Winter   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  This report of the discovery of _Aedes albopictus_ at a truck stop in Kent appears to be valid this time and illustrates how this species can be moved internationally. A 2014 report of _Aedes aegypti_ in southern England was rejected. A statement by Jolyon Medlock, head of Medical Entomology & Zoonoses Ecology, Public Health England, Microbiological Research Authority (MRA), Emergency Response Department, Health Protection and Medical Directorate, Porton Down, Salisbury stated, \"This is misleading information as no invasive aedes mosquitoes have been found in the UK. There have been a number of news articles in British newspapers recently 2014 about invasive mosquitoes, reporting mainly on efforts to increase surveillance for _Aedes albopictus_, however no confirmed reports of any invasive aedes mosquito have been found during this surveillance, nor have any reports been submitted to the Medical Entomology group at Public Health England.\" (see Invasive mosquito - UK (02): (England) comment http://promedmail.org/post/20140923.2795988).  Intensive surveillance will be carried out this time as well. One hopes that successful aggressive efforts to eliminate the mosquitoes before they can become established, as they have become established in Italy and southern France. - Mod.TY  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6406).

This came about after 2\nkidney recipients in Taiwan were diagnosed with dengue 2 days after\nreceiving a kidney each from the same donor, said National Cheng Kung\nUniversity microbiology and immunology professor Dr Oscar Perng\nGuey-chuen. \"This indicates a potential risk,\" the Taiwan-based\nscientist said, adding that no dengue virus was detected in the\ndonor's blood. He said the donor contracted dengue in 2015 and in mid-2016, he died\nin an accident. His family donated his corneas, liver, heart, and\nkidneys. Both patients had the same strain of the dengue virus the\ndonor had in 2015 and one of the recipients died of dengue\nhaemorrhagic fever, he said. Asked where the virus could be hiding since it could not be detected\nin the blood, he said it was a question scientists are trying to\nanswer. Interestingly, those who received the donor's corneas, liver,\nand heart did not develop dengue, Dr Perng said on the sidelines of\nthe National Dengue And Arboviruses Infection Conference 2017\nyesterday 12 Aug 2017. He said although there was not enough\nevidence to show the virus came from the donor as the kidneys were not\ntested for dengue before the transplant, the same virus was found in\nthe patients' bodies after that. Dr Perng said his team had studied mice for dengue virus in the blood\ntestes, kidney, liver, spleen and brain, and found the virus present\nin the kidneys and brain. \"We believe the virus probably resided in\nthe kidneys and was not cleared by the body,\" he said, adding that the\nvirus could have been activated after transplant. He said this raised\nconcerns about asymptomatic people who are dengue carriers. Health Ministry deputy director, general Datuk Dr S Jeyaindran said\npatients with severe dengue would have better recovery if they were\ngiven colloids, a more concentrated fluid, at the early stage in fluid\nmanagement for dengue patients. Dr Jeyaindran, who was representing\nHealth Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam, said colloids may be\nintroduced at an earlier stage, instead of saline because it has not\nbeen successful in treating patients with severe dengue. He said more\nstudies will be conducted to find out at which stage the colloids\nshould be given. byline: Loh Foon Fong \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) - Air travel related spread of dengue.\nDate: Thu 3 Aug 2017.\nSource: Medical Xpress (edited)\n(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-08-air-responsible-dengue-asia.html) \nWhile the incidences of many other infectious diseases have declined\nover the past decade, the number of cases and outbreaks of dengue\nvirus have continued to increase. The spread of dengue to new areas is\nlikely due in large part to trends in air travel, researchers now\nreport in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Dengue virus affects as estimated 390 million people around the globe\neach year, and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild fever and\nheadache to severe low blood pressure. The virus has mostly caused\ndisease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, but a 2014\noutbreak in Japan broke that pattern. Overall, the geographic area\naffected by dengue has been growing in recent years. In the new work, Huaiyu Tian and Bing Xu, both of Beijing Normal\nUniversity, China, together with colleagues from the University of\nOxford and elsewhere analyzed the spread of dengue viruses in Asia\nfrom 1956 to 2015. They used 2202 genetic sequences of dengue viruses,\ncollected in 20 countries or regions of Asia over the 59 years, to\ndetermine how different strains were related. They also investigated\ntrends in air travel, maritime mobility, migration, and\nsocio-economics to determine what factors impact the spread of\ndengue. The spread of 3 different dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1, -2, and -3,\nis associated with air traffic more so than any other factors, the\ndata revealed. Air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India, the\nresearchers found, help seed dengue epidemics, while China, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, and Singapore help diffuse the virus to other Asian\ncountries. \"Future trends in global mobility could potentially accelerate the\nappearance and diffusion of DENV worldwide,\" the researchers say.\n\"Prevention and control of dengue epidemics requires a better\nunderstanding of its mode of geographic dissemination, especially for\ncountries in the tropics.\" Reference: Tian H, Sun Z, Faria NR, et al.

EEE is a rare disease caused by a virus spread by infected mosquitoes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It can cause inflammation of the brain, but on average, only 8 cases of EEE in humans are reported each year, CDC said.  \"The more time someone is outdoors, the more time the person is at risk of being bitten by an infected mosquito; that is why we encourage everyone to take all precautions against mosquito bites,\" said Dr William Grow, South Health District director.  Severe cases of EEE infection in humans begin with the sudden onset of headache, high fever, chills, and vomiting, according to CDC; the illness may then progress into disorientation, seizures, and coma. About a third of patients who develop EEE die, and many of those who survive have mild to severe brain damage, said CDC. There is no specific treatment for EEE. Most cases have been found in Atlantic and Gulf Coast states.  In July 2017, a horse with EEE was found in Brooks county.

The EEE virus is transmitted by mosquitoes. No EEE cases in humans have been reported in Wisconsin since 2011. EEE virus is transmitted to humans, horses, birds, and other animals during bites from infected mosquitoes.  Mosquitoes acquire EEE virus by feeding on infected birds. The virus is not transmitted person to person or directly between animals or between animals and humans. Presence of a EEE positive horse confirms that there are mosquitoes in the area infected with the EEE virus that can transmit the virus to people and other animals.  Clinical signs of EEE infection in horses include depression, loss of appetite, drooping eyelids and lower lip, blindness, paralysis, and death. Horse owners can vaccinate their horses against EEE virus to protect them from becoming ill.  Because EEE virus is known to be currently circulating, Wisconsin residents and visitors to the state should be vigilant in taking measures to prevent mosquito bites. It is important that people contact their healthcare provider if they suspect they have EEE illness. The best way to avoid mosquitoborne diseases is to reduce exposure to mosquitoes and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. When cold weather arrives, the mosquitoes will be eliminated, but until then people are urged to take measures to protect themselves.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)   <br><br><strong>{3}</strong> Wisconsin (Chippewa county).

The 3 articles above include the following measures to prevent mosquito bites: - apply insect repellent containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535, or PMD to clothing as well as exposed skin since mosquitoes may bite through clothing. Be sure to follow the instructions on the label; - wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and socks when outdoors, especially at dawn and dusk to reduce the amount of exposed skin, as weather permits; - avoid being outdoors from dusk to dawn, peak mosquito biting times, if possible; - set up outdoor fans to keep mosquitoes from flying near you; - make sure window and door screens are in good repair to prevent mosquito entry; - any containers that can collect water, such as tin cans, plastic containers, ceramic pots, or discarded tires, should be discarded or dumped daily; turn over wheelbarrows, wading pools, boats, and canoes when not in use; - clean roof gutters and downspouts for proper drainage; - change the water in birdbaths and pet dishes at least every 3 days; - clean and chlorinate swimming pools, outdoor saunas, and hot tubs; drain water from pool covers; - trim tall grass, weeds, and vines since mosquitoes use these areas to rest during hot daylight hours; - landscape to prevent water from pooling in low-lying areas. Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ  Judging from the number of cases on this posting alone, it is clearly arbovirus season.

It is rare in humans. It is\nunclear what symptoms occurred in the person and how the diagnosis was\nmade. The following appears to be the most recent review of _B. mallei_\ninfections in humans including the description of disease\nmanifestations:\nVan Zandt KE, Greer MT, Gelhaus HC. Glanders: an overview of infection\nin humans. Orphanet J Rare Dis. 2013 Sep 3;8:131. doi:\n10.1186/1750-1172-8-131 (the full text and citations can be found at\nthe original URL\n(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3766238/)). \"Features of human clinical glanders\n\n\"General symptoms\n\"Many forms of glanders have been described, including chronic,\ndisseminated, pulmonary, and septicemic. The variety of infections is\nlargely explained by various routes of infection. Localized infections\nare generally regionally confined and typically characterized by foci\nof suppuration. The abscesses can ulcerate and drain for long periods\nof time. However, localized infections may disseminate, leading to\npulmonary, septicemic, or multi-tissue infection <br><br><strong>{9}</strong>. The most common\nclinical features of the eight laboratory-acquired infections from\nFort Detrick included (in order of most common occurrence) afternoon\nto evening low-grade fever, malaise, fatigue, headache, myalgias\nincluding backache, lymphadenopathy, and chest pain. Approximately\nhalf of the patients not only felt better but were also clinically\nbetter for a period of time after the first wave of disease symptoms.\nThis period lasted from a few days to 2 months then patients developed\nclinical signs of infection. \"Mucosal involvement\n\"Involvement of the eye and conjunctiva in a _B. mallei_ infection\npresents with excessive lacrimation and photophobia. Nasal involvement\nis characterized by inflammation and swelling of the nose, which is\ncommon following inhalation of _B. mallei_. This may be followed by\ncopious nasal discharge. Additionally, infection may invade the nasal\nseptum and bony tissues, causing fistulae and tissue destruction <br><br><strong>{9}</strong>.\nThe face may swell and regional lymph nodes may become inflamed.\nInfection may also extend lower in the respiratory tract, resulting in\nbronchitis which can be accompanied by cough and mucopurulent sputum\nproduction. Constitutional signs and symptoms such as fever and chills\ntypically occur within the first few days following infection.\nAdditionally, these symptoms may persist through treatment and be\nsevere. Common signs and symptoms can include, but are not limited to,\nfever or low-grade fever in the afternoon to evening; chills with or\nwithout rigors; and severe headache <br><br><strong>{9}</strong>. \"Cutaneous involvement\n\"Cutaneous manifestations include papular lesions that may erupt\nanywhere on the body with a more chronic, indolent course of\ninfection. _B. mallei_ entry through an abrasion is typically followed\nby an inflammatory response, including pain and swelling. In these\ncases, a glanders node may appear as a single blister, gradually\ndeveloping into an ulcer that may become hemorrhagic 18,35. A\nlocalized infection with a discharge typically develops at the entry\nsite. Inflammation may extend along regional lymphatics and cause\nlymphangitis with numerous foci of suppuration along their course. The\nendotoxins present in _B. mallei_ strains affect the smooth muscle of\nthe lymphatics <br><br><strong>{9}</strong> by enhancing the irritation and inflammation seen\nin the lymphatics. \"Pulmonary involvement\n\"A pulmonary infection typically results in pneumonia, pulmonary\nabscess, pleuritis, and plural effusion. Signs and symptoms of\npulmonary infection can include cough, dyspnea, chest pain, and\nmucoplurent sputum. Nonspecific signs and symptoms such as fatigue,\nfever (often exceeding 102 deg F 38.9 deg C), chills, headache,\nmyalgias, lymphangitis, sore throat, pleuritic chest pain, cough,\ntachypnea, dyspnea, discharge, and gastrointestinal signs often\naccompany respiratory infections <br><br><strong>{9}</strong>. Many symptoms may take up to 2\nto 3 weeks to develop. Nonspecific signs, such as dizziness, rigors,\nmyalgia, nausea, night sweats, severe headache, tachycardia, weight\nloss, and mucosal eruptions are also usually present and may indicate\na disseminated infection <br><br><strong>{9}</strong>. \"Dissemination of infection\n\"Dissemination from local cutaneous or mucosal infection result in\nsepticemia and the colonization of internal organs such as the spleen,\nliver, and lungs with the development of abscesses <br><br><strong>{9}</strong>.\nUltrasonography and computed tomography may reveal multiple, small\ndiscrete abscesses in both the liver and the kidney <br><br><strong>{23}</strong>. These\ninfections are typically associated with septic shock and high\nmortality.\" This publication describes what seems to have been the last of the\ncases of human _B. mallei_ in the USA:\nSrinivasan A, Kraus CN, DeShazer D, et al. Glanders in a military\nresearch microbiologist. N Engl J Med. 2001; 345: 256-8; (full text\nand citations can be found at the original URL\n(http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200107263450404) \"Infection with _Burkholderia mallei_ (formerly _Pseudomonas mallei_)\ncan cause a subcutaneous infection known as farcy or can disseminate\nto cause the condition known as glanders. In humans, acute infection\nwith _B. mallei_ is characterized by necrosis of the tracheobronchial\ntree, pustular skin lesions, and either a febrile pneumonia, if the\norganism was inhaled, or signs of sepsis and multiple abscesses, if\nthe skin was the portal of entry (1). At the turn of the 20th century,\nglanders was an important cause of death among horses, and there were\nsecondary, often fatal, infections in humans (2). Because of the\nlethal and contagious nature of the disease, _B. mallei_ was\nconsidered an ideal agent for biologic warfare and was used for this\npurpose by Germany in World War I (3). \"Aggressive control measures essentially eliminated glanders from the\nWest. However, with the resurgent concern about biologic warfare, _B.\nmallei_ is now being studied in laboratories worldwide. We describe\nhere the first reported case of human glanders in the USA in more than\n50 years and discuss some of the important events in the history of\nthe disease and its initial eradication. \"Case report\n\n\"In March 2000, tender, left axillary adenopathy and fever\n(temperature, 38.6 deg C 101.5 deg F) developed in a 33 year old\nmicrobiologist at the US Army Medical Research Institute for\nInfectious Diseases who had type 1 diabetes mellitus. The patient had\nworked for 2 years investigating the basic microbiology of _B. mallei_\nand did not routinely wear latex gloves. The adenopathy and fever\npersisted despite treatment for 10 days with a first-generation\ncephalosporin. An evaluation after this treatment, which included\nchest radiography as well as cultures of blood and urine, was\nunrevealing. During the next few weeks, the patient had increasing\nfatigue, night sweats, malaise, rigors, and weight loss. \"In early April 2000, his symptoms and adenopathy resolved during a\n10-day course of clarithromycin, but he relapsed 4 days after the\nmedication was stopped. On 2 May 2000, he was admitted to his local\nhospital with diabetic ketoacidosis. A computed tomographic (CT) scan\nshowed multiple hepatic and splenic abscesses. \"On 4 May 2000, respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation\ndeveloped, and the patient was transferred to Johns Hopkins Hospital\nin Baltimore. Physical examination revealed a temperature of 40.3 deg\nC 104.5 deg F and a heart rate of 122 beats per minute. The patient\nhad a grade 2/6 systolic murmur, coarse breath sounds, and moderate\nepigastric tenderness. Laboratory studies showed a white-cell count of\n8300 per cubic millimeter, with 83 per cent neutrophils, 9 per cent\nmonocytes, and 8 per cent lymphocytes. The hematocrit was 25.6 per\ncent. The concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine\naminotransferase were 53 U per liter and 56 U per liter, respectively,\nand the alkaline phosphatase was 197 IU per liter. Cultures of the\npatient's blood and a sample from a fine-needle aspiration biopsy of a\nliver abscess grew a small, bipolar, weakly staining, gram-negative\nrod that was identified by an automated bacterial-identification\nsystem as _Pseudomonas fluorescens_ or _P. putida_. However,\ngas-liquid chromatography of the cellular fatty acids (Microbial ID,\nNewark, Del.) placed the organism in the genus _Burkholderia_.\nSubsequent phenotypic testing and 16S ribosomal RNA gene-sequence\nanalysis identified the organism as _B. mallei_. Initial\nsusceptibility testing showed the isolate to be sensitive to imipenem,\nceftazidime, and tetracycline. \"The patient was treated with imipenem and doxycycline, and there was\nrapid improvement. After two weeks, the imipenem was replaced by\nazithromycin, and the patient completed a six-month course of\ntreatment with azithromycin and doxycycline. Although the organism was\nfound retrospectively to be relatively resistant to azithromycin, a CT\nscan obtained after six months of treatment showed substantial\nimprovement of the liver and spleen abscesses, and one year later the\npatient remained in good health. \"Discussion\n\nThis is the 1st reported human case of glanders in the\nEnglish-language medical literature since 1949 (4) and it occurred in\nthe context of research on agents of biologic warfare. \"Glanders may have been the first biologic weapon of the 20th century.\nDuring World War I, Germany had a program of biologic sabotage against\nseveral countries, including the United States, whereby cultures of\n_B. mallei_ and anthrax were distributed to undercover agents who\nattempted to infect livestock that were to be shipped to Allied\ncountries (3). The intention was both the destruction of livestock and\nthe transmission of the highly contagious, lethal agent from livestock\nto humans. It is currently suspected that attempts are being made to\ndevelop an aerosolized form of antibiotic-resistant _B. mallei_ that\ncould become a biologic weapon as potent as anthrax. \"Glanders, an important human and veterinary disease, was eliminated\nwithout a vaccine or effective treatment. It appears to have been\nabolished by the veterinary use of a skin test to detect exposure to\nB. mallei combined with draconian agricultural measures to control\ninfection (5). \"At the turn of the 20th century, Canada, Britain, and the USA all\nimplemented glanders-control programs. By that time, the symptoms of\nequine glanders, which include fever and inflammation of the nasal\nmucosa with ultimate necrosis and obstruction of the oropharynx, had\nbeen well described (6). Laws were passed that required notification\nof the health department and the immediate slaughter of affected\nanimals, with proper disposal of the carcasses. In addition, all\nhorses on the premises where the infected horses were found had to be\ntested with the mallein skin test for exposure to _B. mallei_; any\nhorses with a reaction also had to be slaughtered. Horses with no\nreaction were quarantined and then retested two to three weeks later.\nFurthermore, the equine contacts of the horses were traced to track\ndown other horses that might have been exposed and then moved to other\nfacilities. \"The case we describe illustrates the major clinical features of\nglanders, which can usually be traced to direct contact with _B.\nmallei_, as in workers exposed to animals with glanders (7) and in\npersonnel who were exposed in laboratories during World War II (8).\nAlthough the patient discussed here could not recall a clear break in\nhis skin or an accident in the laboratory, most reported occupational\ninfections occur without recognized instances of exposure (9). As\nRobins commented in 1906, \"It is perhaps not advisable to be too\ndogmatic as to the invariable necessity of an abrasion being present\nin every case of human glanders . . . as in several such cases of\nour series it is distinctly stated that there was no abrasion.\" (7).\nAs in our patient, _B. mallei_ often enters the body through the hand\nor arm. After an incubation period lasting between a few days and\nseveral weeks, local suppuration and regional lymphadenopathy occur.\nConstitutional symptoms often accompany the infection, with fever,\nrigors, and malaise predominating. If the infection is left untreated,\nabscesses in the lymph nodes will generally form, then break down and\ndrain. \"Dissemination of the infection occurs 1 to 4 weeks after infection of\nthe lymph nodes. Abscesses can be widespread, and _B. mallei_ can\ninfect almost any tissue (7). Abscesses in the liver and the spleen,\nas were seen in our patient, appear to be relatively common, as does\npulmonary involvement, including consolidation, abscesses, and pleural\nnodules. The acute onset and rapid resolution of the respiratory\nfailure in our patient were more consistent with the respiratory\ndistress syndrome associated with gram-negative bacteremia than with\nthat associated with pulmonary glanders. Subcutaneous and\nintramuscular abscesses sometimes develop as well (7). \"There are few data regarding the antibiotic treatment of glanders,\nsince the disease had largely disappeared by the time antibiotics\nbecame available. In vitro, ceftazidime, gentamicin, imipenem,\ndoxycycline, and ciprofloxacin all have reliable activity against _B.\nmallei_ (10), and our patient's infection responded well to a\ncombination of imipenem and doxycycline. Experimentally induced\nglanders also responds to a combination of sulfazine and trimethoprim\n(11). However, treatment of the disease in the setting of bioterrorism\nmay be more difficult if the organism is drug-resistant. \"This case demonstrates the difficulties that microbiology\nlaboratories may have in recognizing potential agents of biologic\nwarfare. These microbes are rarely encountered and may be\nmisidentified by conventional, phenotypic identification systems.\nTechniques such as cellular analysis of fatty acid and 16S ribosomal\nRNA gene sequencing can be used to identify the organisms correctly,\nbut these tests are not widely available. \"Finally, this case may serve as a harbinger of the resurgence of\nnearly forgotten diseases such as glanders, plague, smallpox, and\nanthrax. Research on these diseases is now being conducted in more\nlaboratories, which increases the risk of occupational exposure. There\nis also the looming threat that some group will eventually mount a\nsuccessful campaign of bioterrorism. Resources must be allocated both\nto prevent and to prepare for these frightening possibilities.\" Maps of Brazil can be seen at\n(http://s13.postimg.org/jumnalk87/map_of_Brazil.gif) and\n(http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62881).

The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare is advising tourists to go to hospital if they develop a high fever or generalized rash after returning to Japan.  Although the World Health Organization verified that Japan has eliminated infections of endemic measles strains in 2015, group infections originating from people who contracted the disease abroad are spreading in the country. As of 6 Aug 2017, the number of patients reached 169 this year in Japan, already eclipsing the figure in the previous year.  About 4100 patients in Italy and around 6500 patients in Romania have already been confirmed as of August 2017 compared with about 860 and 2000, respectively, throughout 2016, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.  Symptoms of the highly contagious disease include runny nose, red and watery eyes, high fever, and rash. The virus is spread through coughing and sneezing and can cause complications such as pneumonia and can even result in death in one in 1000 patients, according to the ministry. The ministry recommends people traveling overseas to check their vaccination records and take an additional shot if they have only been vaccinated once.

Large measles outbreak introduced by asylum seekers and spread among the insufficiently vaccinated resident population, Berlin, October 2014 to August 2015. Euro Surveill. 2017; 22(34): pii=30599 - Abstract  The largest measles outbreak in Berlin since 2001 occurred from October 2014 to August 2015. Overall, 1344 cases were ascertained, 86 per cent (with available information) unvaccinated, including 146 (12 per cent) asylum seekers. Median age was 17 years (interquartile range: 4-29 years), 26 per cent were hospitalised and a 1 year old child died. Measles virus genotyping uniformly revealed the variant 'D8-Rostov-Don' and descendants. The virus was likely introduced by and initially spread among asylum seekers before affecting Berlin's resident population. Among Berlin residents, the highest incidence was in children younger than 2 years, yet most cases (52 per cent) were adults. Post-exposure vaccinations in homes for asylum seekers, not always conducted, occurred later (median: 7.5 days) than the recommended 72 hours after onset of the 1st case and reached only half of potential contacts. Asylum seekers should not only have non-discriminatory, equitable access to vaccination, they also need to be offered measles vaccination in a timely fashion, that is, immediately upon arrival in the receiving country. Supplementary immunisation activities targeting the resident population, particularly adults, are urgently needed in Berlin.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail.

Source: Romania Insider (edited) (https://www.romania-insider.com/measles-kills-iraqi-refugee/)   The ongoing measles outbreak keeps making victims in Romania. A 10 month old girl, who was a refugee from Iraq, became the 33rd person to die of the infection, reports local Digi24. The girl arrived in Romania on 7 Jul 2017 with her family, and the doctors diagnosed her with measles in August. They also discovered that the child was suffering from malnutrition and severe psychomotor retardation.  The measles outbreak is still a major problem in Romania, with more than 8900 cases reported across the country until 25 Aug 2017, including 33 deaths, according to data from the National Center for Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases (CNSCBT). Most deaths were registered in Timis (9), Dolj (7), and Arad (6) counties.  Measles is a highly contagious respiratory infection caused by a virus. It causes a total-body skin rash and flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough, and runny nose. According to information posted on WHO's website, the virus is highly contagious, spreading by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact, and direct contact with infected nasal or throat secretions. Unvaccinated young children pose the highest risk of measles and its complications, including death.  The Romanian Government adopted earlier this month August 2017 a draft bill on the organization and financing of population vaccination (https://www.romania-insider.com/romania-draft-bill-vaccination/). The project was sent to the Parliament for approval and could come into force in January 2018.  byline: Irina Marica   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Measles tends to be more severe in children who are malnourished, especially children who are also vitamin A deficient. And complications are commoner and more serious in malnourished children. Because of complications such as diarrhoea, measles may lead to failure to thrive. Infection with measles virus may lead to kwashiorkor or marasmus in children who are underweight at the time that they get infected. Therefore, measles may result in, or aggravate, malnutrition.

Date: Sat 26 Aug 2017. Source: News-Medical/Life Sciences (edited) (https://www.news-medical.net/news/20170826/New-study-highlights-role-played-by-demographics-in-the-spread-of-measles.aspx)   Even if the incidence of measles infection has decreased by at least 90 per cent worldwide since the introduction of the vaccine, measles is still one of the major causes of death in children among vaccine-preventable diseases. Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world.  A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries.  Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years.  \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\"  \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea\".  The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years 2 million DALYs since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln 13 million DALYs in the US, and 36-mln 36 million DALYs in Ethiopia.  \"Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,\" continues Prof Melegaro \"our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population. Tailoring immunization campaigns to achieve measles eradication goals is essential and currently, for some countries, this means considering also the role of unprotected adolescents and young adults.\"   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Reference - Trentini F, Poletti P, Merler S, Melegaro A.

Thus, the HPAI epidemic\nseems to be waning in Germany. However, outbreaks or infections in\nwild birds are sporadically reported. The current avian flu epidemic is the most severe and longest-lasting\nepidemic that has occurred in Europe so far. In total, 29 European\nstates have been or still are concerned. In addition to H5N8, 2 other HPAI subtypes have been detected in\nEurope, i.e. HPAI H5N5 (in 7 states) and H5N6 (in Greece). Outside\nEurope, avian influenza outbreaks of the subtype HPAI H5N8 have been\nreported from Russia, Israel, Egypt, Tunisia, Nigeria, Uganda,\nCameroon, Iran, Nepal, and India. HPAI H5N1 is endemic in Asia and\nsome African countries. Moreover, further HPAIV H5N1 related\nH5-strains are circulating in Asia. Although the current epidemic seems to be waning, isolated outbreaks\nmay still occur.

The total amount of dead wild boars discovered in the woods around\nZlín, in the far east of the Czech Republic, stood at 94 at the end\nof August 2017. In this month, 23 new infected carcasses were found,\nwhich is a downward trend from July 2017, when 68 reports were sent\nto the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). The 1st report of\nASF in Czech wild boars was on Wed 21 Jun 2017. Many neighbouring countries have alerted their local pig producers to\nbe very careful what to feed their pigs - and their inhabitants what\nto purchase and how to dispose of it. So did Slovakia, according to\nthe Slovak Spectator. Zlín is only a few km away from the western\nSlovak border, to its north is Poland where ASF has been around since\n2014 and on its eastern border is Ukraine, where ASF has been\nconfirmed since 2011. In a presentation, given in mid-July 2017 to the European\nCommission's Standing Committee On Animals, Plants, Food and Feed\n(SCoPAFF), Dr Petr Šatrán of the Czech State Veterinary\nAdministration indicated that human activities are most likely the\ncause of the spread of the virus, seeing that the nearest reported\ncases of ASF were roughly 500 km 310.68 mi away and that the\npositive dead wild boars were found in inhabited areas. In the other country where ASF was found for the 1st time in 2017,\nRomania, things appear relatively quiet. News broke early this month\nAugust 2017 that ASF was also found on 2 backyard farms in the north\nof the country. Ever since, the Romanian authorities did not report\nany further outbreaks of ASF to the OIE. Of all other countries in the European Union, especially Poland has\ncontinued to report outbreaks of African Swine Fever in smaller and\nmiddle-sized operations. In August alone, on 23 farm sites of various\nsizes, ASF was found to have infected at least one animal, after which\nthe entire herd would have to be culled. The biggest operation in this respect was a farm near Monki, Podlaskie\nprovince, where all remaining 431 pigs had to be culled after 11 had\ndied as a result of ASF, on Sat 19 Aug 2017. Noteworthy as well was\nthe ASF-related closure of 2 farms in Lack, Lubelskie province, in\nearly August. These farms had 136 and 141 pigs respectively see also\nitem 2.

This was said by Poland's Minister of Agriculture,\nKrzysztof Yurgel, Niezalezna reports. As reported, the length of the fence will be 729 km 452.98 mi,\ncosting Poland 130 million zloties (more than 36.2 million USD). The\nfinal decision on a fence will be made within the next 3 weeks.

EU disease control measures require designation of risk areas as Part\nI (wild boar at risk, but no cases found), Part II (wild boar testing\npositive but no spill over into domestic pigs), Part III (cases in\nwild boar and occasional spill over into domestic pigs) and Part IV\nwhich concerns the island of Sardinia only. Consignments of live pigs,\nlive wild boars, meat of either source and animal by-products of\neither source are only allowed under certain derogations. For a full\nexplanation, see European Commission Implementing Decision\n2014/708/EU. ASF, a viral disease against which no vaccine has become available so\nfar, is currently threatening central and western Europe, where dense\npopulations of wild boar are present. According to a recent update of DEFRA (UK) ASF situation assessment,\nthe continuing cases in the Czech Republic, the spread in Poland which\nappears to be due to several breakdowns in biosecurity and the new\noutbreaks in Romania are \"concerning\". This signifies a spread in\ngeographic distribution, a possible drop in biosecurity awareness and\ntherefore an increase in the weight of infection in East Europe. Despite the relatively low level of trade in live pigs, there could be\na substantial movement of people, vehicles and personal imports of\npork products, therefore the risk of ASF introduction to the UK has\nbeen raised from \"very low\" (that is, \"rare but could occur\") to\n\"low\". The Russian veterinary watchdog Rosselkhoznadzor believes ASF will\nkeep moving west via 2 main pathways. The southerly route, has already\nseen the virus spread from Ukraine to Moldova. Russian vets believe it\ncould penetrate central Romania, then move to the Balkans, including\nBulgaria and Serbia. On the northern route, now that ASF has been found in the Czech\nRepublic, Rosselkhoznadzor believes, if it gains a foothold, it is\nlikely to head further west, with Germany next in the firing line. The\nsaid is included in a recent update by the Russian journalist\nVladislav Vorotnikov, available at\n(http://www.pig-world.co.uk/comment/where-next-for-african-swine-fever.html).\n- Mod.AS ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Ghana":{},"Greece":{"116":{"title":"West Nile virus - Europe (05): Greece ","date":["25","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH/EDR> West Nile virus - Europe (05): Greece [EXTERNAL]","summary":" A ProMED-mail post (http://www.promedmail.org) ProMED-mail is a program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases (http://www.isid.org) .

The deaths from more than 16 539 cases reported so far in\n2017 represent 94 percent of the overall incidence in the regions of\nAfrica. This follows a major epidemic reported mainly in the North\nKivu province, which is the epicentre of the conflict between rebel\ngroups and the government. In the region, health delivery services have come to a standstill\nowing to the conflict. Civilians have been forced to flee their homes,\nadding to the tens of thousands already living in camps for internally\ndisplaced people. Meanwhile, In West Africa, similarly to 2016, several countries report\nsporadic cases. Terror-ridden Nigeria is also battling a severe\noutbreak of the water borne disease with 20 deaths recorded from 809\ncases in 2017. Liberia, a hotspot for diseases, is also affected with\n6 deaths from 129 cases. There have also been outbreaks in Cameroon,\nGhana and Ivory Cast but no casualties have been reported. Overall,\n488 deaths have been reported from 17 548 cases in the affected\nregions. The United Nations Children's Fund stressed the need for increasing\nvigilance and implementing preventative measures in the current\nat-risk seasonal period. \"This highlights the importance of regular\ninformation exchange within countries sharing the same epidemiological\nbasin.\" Byline: Jean Kassongo \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Cholera - Tanzania.\nDate: Wed 16 Aug 2017.\nSource: WHO (edited)\n(http://reliefweb.int/report/united-republic-tanzania/taking-stock-lessons-learnt-cholera-outbreak-response-tanzania) \nTaking stock of lessons learnt from the Cholera outbreak response in\nTanzania\n\nThe United Republic of Tanzania is battling an outbreak of Cholera\nthat has since August 2015 affected 26 046 people and claimed 410\nlives. Ending the outbreak and preventing its spread beyond Tanzania's\nborders is a high priority for WHO. To that end, WHO and partners\nsupport a well-coordinated multisectoral response through the National\nCholera Task Force which plans, coordinates and support subnational\nauthorities. Indeed, learning requires a continuous assessment of performance, a\nreview of successes and failures and a robust support for improvement.\nAn After Action Review (AAR) is a simple methodology for facilitating\nthis assessment. It provides for a qualitative review of actions taken\nto respond to an emergency as a means of identifying best practices,\ngaps and lessons learned. As a component of the IHR Monitoring and\nEvaluation Framework (IHR MEF) and part of the preparedness and\nresponse cycle, an AAR seeks to identify what worked well or not and\nhow these practices can be maintained, improved, institutionalized and\nshared with relevant stakeholders. It is within this context that WHO\nsupported the Ministry of Health to convene a meeting of experts to\nconduct an After Action Review following the national response to the\ncholera outbreak. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{3}</strong> Cholera - Sudan.\nDate: Thu 17 Aug 2017.\nSource: Radio Dabanga (edited)\n(http://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/cholera-new-deaths-and-infections-across-sudan) \nSinga Hospital in Sudan's Sennar received 16 new cases of cholera\nduring the 1st half of this week week of Sun 13 Aug 2017. A woman\nhas died before she could be transferred to hospital, and 9 others\nwere infected with cholera at El Matateib in North Delta locality in\nSudan's Kassala state. Sennar State\nA medical source told Radio Dabanga that most of the cases in Sennar\ncame from Um Benin village southeast of the city except for 2 cases\nfrom El Dindir and El Souki. From Saturday to Monday 12-14 Aug 2017,\n26 cases of cholera arrived from Um Benin village. This led the local\nhealth authorities to open a new cholera isolation centre at the\nvillage. El Gedaref State\nEl Gedaref Hospital in East Sudan recorded 15 cases of cholera on\nTuesday and Wednesday 15-16 Aug 2017. A medical source told Radio\nDabanga that the hospital received 9 cases on Tue 15 Aug 2017, while\n6 cases were recorded on Wed 16Aug 2017. The medic said that all\ncases of cholera came from Uktuber, El Tadamon, El Geneina, and\nKadugli districts in El Gedaref. Kassala State\nA woman has died before she could be transferred to hospital, and 9\nothers were infected with cholera at El Matateib in North Delta\nlocality in Sudan's Kassala state. Youth activist Mohamed Seyidna told\nRadio Dabanga that \"the woman died in the village before she could be\ntransferred to the hospital\". He said that the hospitalised cases at\nWagar Hospital have risen to 9. He attributed the spread of cholera in the area to water pollution and\ncalled on the health authorities to make efforts to sterilize drinking\nwater and raise awareness of the residents. National epidemic\nThe National Epidemiological Corporation reported in early July 2017\nthat nearly 24 000 Sudanese have been infected and 940 cholera\npatients have died since the outbreak of the infectious disease in\nBlue Nile state in August 2016. The Sudanese authorities however,\nrefuse to call the disease by its name, and instead refer to it as\n\"Acute Watery Diarrhea\". The National Intelligence and Security\nService has repeatedly warned medics and the press in the country not\nto make mention of cholera. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{4}</strong> Cholera - Pakistan (Punjab Province).\nDate: Wed 16 Aug 2017.\nSource: The News (edited)\n(https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/223756-Number-of-cholera-cases-continues-to-swell) \nThe number of cases of cholera, a highly contagious and fatal disease\nis continuously on the rise and there is a threat that spread of the\ninfection may take shape of an epidemic if proper preventive and\ncontrol measures are not taken well in time. The 1st 2 cases of\ncholera were tested positive by National Institute of Health Islamabad\non Mon 31 Jul 2017 and another 2 confirmed positive for the\ninfection on Fri 4 Aug 2017. All the 4 patients were undergoing\ntreatment at Benazir Bhutto Hospital BH where as many as 4 more\nsuspects of the infection have been admitted for treatment. Data collected by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017 reveals that the\nallied hospitals have sent stool samples of over 10 child patients to\nNIH for confirmation of cholera in last week week of Sun 6 Aug\n2017. On Sat 12 Aug 2017, as many as 20 child patients with severe\ndiarrhoea were admitted at the BBH of which 4 were suspected as\npatients of cholera and their stool samples were sent to NIH for\nconfirmation, said Associate Professor of Paediatrics at Rawalpindi\nMedical University Dr Tariq Saeed when contacted by 'The News' on Mon\n14 Aug 2017. He added the hospital has not received confirmation reports from the\nNIH because of holidays there from Saturday to Monday. However, we\nhave been keeping the suspects in isolation under strict monitoring,\nhe said. He added that repeated rainfalls in the region and water inundation\ninside and outside homes in a number of localities particularly in\nthickly populated areas of the city are causing contamination of water\nand foodstuff that increases chances of spread of a number of\ninfections among population while children are at greater risk of\ncontracting life-threatening infections including cholera. It is important that the transmission of cholera occurs primarily by\ndrinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the feces\n(waste product) of an infected person, including one with no apparent\nsymptoms. It is observed that heavy rainfall causes collection of heavily\ncontaminated water in streets and houses and the waste water flooding\nout of various nullahs watercourses including Nullah Leh in town\ncauses infections including cholera, typhoid, dysentery,\ngastroenteritis, hepatitis A and E, shigellosis and giardiasis. Professor Tariq said the consumption of contaminated water and\nfoodstuff causes cholera, an infection in the small intestine caused\nby bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. Its main symptoms are watery diarrhea\nand vomiting that can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte\nimbalance, and death in cases which are not treated in time, he said. Health experts say that to avoid cholera and other infections, one\nmust use boiled water for drinking and should use vegetables after\nwashing with clean water and it must be kept in mind that raw\nvegetables should not be eaten in the existing weather conditions\ninstead these should be used after cooking. To a query, Professor Tariq said the heavy rainfall and water\naccumulation may contaminate water at sources and there may be chances\nof contamination of water at tube wells so individuals must boil water\nbefore drinking to avoid cholera and other infections. He added the appearance of cholera is alarming and it is time for\npeople to take extra ordinary preventive measures to safeguard their\nchildren and themselves from the disease. In case water is accumulated inside home due to heavy rainfall and\nflooded out of sewage lines, it must be wiped out immediately and the\nspace should be washed with clean water as soon as possible to avoid\ninfections. Avoiding inundation of contaminated water inside homes is\na must to avoid cholera and other infections, said Professor Tariq.

NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in\npress): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons,\nvaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside\nof Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as\n60-80 percent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection\nlengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are: - Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 percent (95 percent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam; - Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however,\nhave suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be\neffective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and\noutbreak situations (63, 64). \"References\n-\n57.

Ending the outbreak and preventing its spread beyond Tanzania's\nborders is a high priority for WHO. To that end, WHO and partners\nsupport a well-coordinated multisectoral response through the National\nCholera Task Force which plans, coordinates and support subnational\nauthorities. Indeed, learning requires a continuous assessment of performance, a\nreview of successes and failures and a robust support for improvement.\nAn After Action Review (AAR) is a simple methodology for facilitating\nthis assessment. It provides for a qualitative review of actions taken\nto respond to an emergency as a means of identifying best practices,\ngaps and lessons learned. As a component of the IHR Monitoring and\nEvaluation Framework (IHR MEF) and part of the preparedness and\nresponse cycle, an AAR seeks to identify what worked well or not and\nhow these practices can be maintained, improved, institutionalized and\nshared with relevant stakeholders. It is within this context that WHO\nsupported the Ministry of Health to convene a meeting of experts to\nconduct an After Action Review following the national response to the\ncholera outbreak. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{3}</strong> Cholera - Sudan.\nDate: Thu 17 Aug 2017.\nSource: Radio Dabanga (edited)\n(http://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/cholera-new-deaths-and-infections-across-sudan) \nSinga Hospital in Sudan's Sennar received 16 new cases of cholera\nduring the 1st half of this week week of Sun 13 Aug 2017.

Sennar State\nA medical source told Radio Dabanga that most of the cases in Sennar\ncame from Um Benin village southeast of the city except for 2 cases\nfrom El Dindir and El Souki. From Saturday to Monday 12-14 Aug 2017,\n26 cases of cholera arrived from Um Benin village. This led the local\nhealth authorities to open a new cholera isolation centre at the\nvillage. El Gedaref State\nEl Gedaref Hospital in East Sudan recorded 15 cases of cholera on\nTuesday and Wednesday 15-16 Aug 2017. A medical source told Radio\nDabanga that the hospital received 9 cases on Tue 15 Aug 2017, while\n6 cases were recorded on Wed 16Aug 2017. The medic said that all\ncases of cholera came from Uktuber, El Tadamon, El Geneina, and\nKadugli districts in El Gedaref. Kassala State\nA woman has died before she could be transferred to hospital, and 9\nothers were infected with cholera at El Matateib in North Delta\nlocality in Sudan's Kassala state. Youth activist Mohamed Seyidna told\nRadio Dabanga that \"the woman died in the village before she could be\ntransferred to the hospital\". He said that the hospitalised cases at\nWagar Hospital have risen to 9. He attributed the spread of cholera in the area to water pollution and\ncalled on the health authorities to make efforts to sterilize drinking\nwater and raise awareness of the residents. National epidemic\nThe National Epidemiological Corporation reported in early July 2017\nthat nearly 24 000 Sudanese have been infected and 940 cholera\npatients have died since the outbreak of the infectious disease in\nBlue Nile state in August 2016. The Sudanese authorities however,\nrefuse to call the disease by its name, and instead refer to it as\n\"Acute Watery Diarrhea\". The National Intelligence and Security\nService has repeatedly warned medics and the press in the country not\nto make mention of cholera. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{4}</strong> Cholera - Pakistan (Punjab Province).\nDate: Wed 16 Aug 2017.\nSource: The News (edited)\n(https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/223756-Number-of-cholera-cases-continues-to-swell) \nThe number of cases of cholera, a highly contagious and fatal disease\nis continuously on the rise and there is a threat that spread of the\ninfection may take shape of an epidemic if proper preventive and\ncontrol measures are not taken well in time. The 1st 2 cases of\ncholera were tested positive by National Institute of Health Islamabad\non Mon 31 Jul 2017 and another 2 confirmed positive for the\ninfection on Fri 4 Aug 2017. All the 4 patients were undergoing\ntreatment at Benazir Bhutto Hospital BH where as many as 4 more\nsuspects of the infection have been admitted for treatment. Data collected by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017 reveals that the\nallied hospitals have sent stool samples of over 10 child patients to\nNIH for confirmation of cholera in last week week of Sun 6 Aug\n2017. On Sat 12 Aug 2017, as many as 20 child patients with severe\ndiarrhoea were admitted at the BBH of which 4 were suspected as\npatients of cholera and their stool samples were sent to NIH for\nconfirmation, said Associate Professor of Paediatrics at Rawalpindi\nMedical University Dr Tariq Saeed when contacted by 'The News' on Mon\n14 Aug 2017. He added the hospital has not received confirmation reports from the\nNIH because of holidays there from Saturday to Monday. However, we\nhave been keeping the suspects in isolation under strict monitoring,\nhe said. He added that repeated rainfalls in the region and water inundation\ninside and outside homes in a number of localities particularly in\nthickly populated areas of the city are causing contamination of water\nand foodstuff that increases chances of spread of a number of\ninfections among population while children are at greater risk of\ncontracting life-threatening infections including cholera. It is important that the transmission of cholera occurs primarily by\ndrinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the feces\n(waste product) of an infected person, including one with no apparent\nsymptoms. It is observed that heavy rainfall causes collection of heavily\ncontaminated water in streets and houses and the waste water flooding\nout of various nullahs watercourses including Nullah Leh in town\ncauses infections including cholera, typhoid, dysentery,\ngastroenteritis, hepatitis A and E, shigellosis and giardiasis. Professor Tariq said the consumption of contaminated water and\nfoodstuff causes cholera, an infection in the small intestine caused\nby bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. Its main symptoms are watery diarrhea\nand vomiting that can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte\nimbalance, and death in cases which are not treated in time, he said. Health experts say that to avoid cholera and other infections, one\nmust use boiled water for drinking and should use vegetables after\nwashing with clean water and it must be kept in mind that raw\nvegetables should not be eaten in the existing weather conditions\ninstead these should be used after cooking. To a query, Professor Tariq said the heavy rainfall and water\naccumulation may contaminate water at sources and there may be chances\nof contamination of water at tube wells so individuals must boil water\nbefore drinking to avoid cholera and other infections. He added the appearance of cholera is alarming and it is time for\npeople to take extra ordinary preventive measures to safeguard their\nchildren and themselves from the disease. In case water is accumulated inside home due to heavy rainfall and\nflooded out of sewage lines, it must be wiped out immediately and the\nspace should be washed with clean water as soon as possible to avoid\ninfections. Avoiding inundation of contaminated water inside homes is\na must to avoid cholera and other infections, said Professor Tariq.

On Sun 3 Sep 2017, some 59 officers were hospitalised in various\nhospitals in Nairobi with another 36 admitted Mon 4 Sep 2017, after\ncontracting the disease. They were part of a group of 430 officers\ndeployed to Nairobi ahead of the Supreme Court ruling on presidential\npoll petition on Fri 1 Sep 2017. They were residing at the\nMultimedia University Hotel in Rongai, about 17 kilometers 10.6 mi\nsouth of the capital. \"Those infected did not get the disease from the Multimedia University\nsince they had their lunch away from the institution. Investigations\nshow that the source is the Nairobi Area Police Canteen,\" said Dr\nRalph Muli, the Nairobi County head of Diseases Surveillance.\nConsequently, the City has temporarily closed the canteen. The Health Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu said the officers were in\nstable condition. Dr Mailu said investigations were underway to\nestablish whether the canteen had outsourced services to cater for the\nlarge number of officers. He said the ministry was concerned that\ninstead of eliminating cholera, new cases were emerging. Nairobi was first hit by the outbreak on 19 May 2017, with 56 cases\nhaving been reported. One of the police officers who requested anonymity said they ate ugali\n(a Kenyan staple made of maize flour) and meat stew at the canteen on\nSat 2 Sep 2017.

The\nfollowing is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In:\nChronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract.\nGreydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in\npress): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons,\nvaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside\nof Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as\n60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection\nlengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:\n- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam;\n- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however,\nhave suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be\neffective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and\noutbreak situations (63, 64). \"References\n\n57.

(promed@promedmail.org)  The Chinese giant salamander (_Andrias davidianus_) is the largest amphibian in the world. It can grow to more than one meter (3.3 ft) in length. This species used to be widespread in central, south western, and southern China, but it is considered to be critically endangered. It has declined catastrophically over the last 30 years, principally due to over-exploitation, and it is now very rare, with few surviving populations known. Commercial over-exploitation for human consumption is the main threat to this species. It has also suffered from habitat destruction (such as from the construction of dams) and habitat degradation (such as water pollution from mines). For a picture go to (http://www.factzoo.com/sites/all/img/amphibians/salamander/chinese-giant-salamander.jpg).  In 2010, an outbreak of disease occurred amongst farmed Chinese giant salamanders in Shanxi Province, China. Clinical signs included anorexia, lethargy, ecchymosis, and swollen areas on the head and limbs and skin ulceration. An investigation was carried out and they isolated for the 1st time a ranavirus infection associated with mass mortality in Chinese giant salamanders. This virus was named Chinese giant salamander virus (CGSV-L). This virus has not been studied in the wild. It might be possible that it circulates causing little impact, but under the stressing circumstances that might arise in captivity the virulence increases. - Mod.PMB  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/58595).

This came about after 2\nkidney recipients in Taiwan were diagnosed with dengue 2 days after\nreceiving a kidney each from the same donor, said National Cheng Kung\nUniversity microbiology and immunology professor Dr Oscar Perng\nGuey-chuen. \"This indicates a potential risk,\" the Taiwan-based\nscientist said, adding that no dengue virus was detected in the\ndonor's blood. He said the donor contracted dengue in 2015 and in mid-2016, he died\nin an accident. His family donated his corneas, liver, heart, and\nkidneys. Both patients had the same strain of the dengue virus the\ndonor had in 2015 and one of the recipients died of dengue\nhaemorrhagic fever, he said. Asked where the virus could be hiding since it could not be detected\nin the blood, he said it was a question scientists are trying to\nanswer. Interestingly, those who received the donor's corneas, liver,\nand heart did not develop dengue, Dr Perng said on the sidelines of\nthe National Dengue And Arboviruses Infection Conference 2017\nyesterday 12 Aug 2017. He said although there was not enough\nevidence to show the virus came from the donor as the kidneys were not\ntested for dengue before the transplant, the same virus was found in\nthe patients' bodies after that. Dr Perng said his team had studied mice for dengue virus in the blood\ntestes, kidney, liver, spleen and brain, and found the virus present\nin the kidneys and brain. \"We believe the virus probably resided in\nthe kidneys and was not cleared by the body,\" he said, adding that the\nvirus could have been activated after transplant. He said this raised\nconcerns about asymptomatic people who are dengue carriers. Health Ministry deputy director, general Datuk Dr S Jeyaindran said\npatients with severe dengue would have better recovery if they were\ngiven colloids, a more concentrated fluid, at the early stage in fluid\nmanagement for dengue patients. Dr Jeyaindran, who was representing\nHealth Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam, said colloids may be\nintroduced at an earlier stage, instead of saline because it has not\nbeen successful in treating patients with severe dengue. He said more\nstudies will be conducted to find out at which stage the colloids\nshould be given. byline: Loh Foon Fong \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) - Air travel related spread of dengue.\nDate: Thu 3 Aug 2017.\nSource: Medical Xpress (edited)\n(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-08-air-responsible-dengue-asia.html) \nWhile the incidences of many other infectious diseases have declined\nover the past decade, the number of cases and outbreaks of dengue\nvirus have continued to increase. The spread of dengue to new areas is\nlikely due in large part to trends in air travel, researchers now\nreport in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Dengue virus affects as estimated 390 million people around the globe\neach year, and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild fever and\nheadache to severe low blood pressure. The virus has mostly caused\ndisease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, but a 2014\noutbreak in Japan broke that pattern. Overall, the geographic area\naffected by dengue has been growing in recent years. In the new work, Huaiyu Tian and Bing Xu, both of Beijing Normal\nUniversity, China, together with colleagues from the University of\nOxford and elsewhere analyzed the spread of dengue viruses in Asia\nfrom 1956 to 2015. They used 2202 genetic sequences of dengue viruses,\ncollected in 20 countries or regions of Asia over the 59 years, to\ndetermine how different strains were related. They also investigated\ntrends in air travel, maritime mobility, migration, and\nsocio-economics to determine what factors impact the spread of\ndengue. The spread of 3 different dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1, -2, and -3,\nis associated with air traffic more so than any other factors, the\ndata revealed. Air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India, the\nresearchers found, help seed dengue epidemics, while China, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, and Singapore help diffuse the virus to other Asian\ncountries. \"Future trends in global mobility could potentially accelerate the\nappearance and diffusion of DENV worldwide,\" the researchers say.\n\"Prevention and control of dengue epidemics requires a better\nunderstanding of its mode of geographic dissemination, especially for\ncountries in the tropics.\" Reference: Tian H, Sun Z, Faria NR, et al.

Source: The Hindu (edited) (http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/only-some-children-with-fever-progress-to-aes-says-doctor/article19499880.ece)   Based on a study carried out in 2015, a team led by Dr Manoj V Murhekar, Director of the Chennai-based National Institute of Epidemiology, found scrub typhus to be responsible for acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in 63 percent of patients admitted to the Baba Raghav Das Medical College Hospital in Gorakhpur Uttar Pradesh state, UP.  The study was repeated last year 2016 by the same team by comparing children with AES and healthy children who are siblings of the patients or living in the same village.  It found that AES patients had 35 times greater possibility of having antibodies against scrub typhus compared with healthy children thereby confirming that AES was caused by scrub typhus.  Excerpts from an interview with Dr Manoj Murhekar: - Have you carried out any studies this year 2017 on children admitted to BRD hospital with AES? How likely is scrub typhus to have caused AES this year as well? The causation of the disease or etiology will not change from year to year. In 2015 and 2016 we have seen that scrub typhus was responsible for over 60 percent of AES and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) causes less than 10 percent of AES in children below 15 years. Scrub typhus was responsible for over 60 percent of AES even in 2014. There is vaccination for JE virus but no intervention has been implemented widely for scrub typhus. So the etiology wouldn't have changed compared with last year.  - Besides BRD hospital, is there any other referral hospital in that region? What is the extent of population that BRD hospital caters to? Except BRD hospital, there is no referral hospital in the Gorakhpur Division in Uttar Pradesh. The hospital caters to people living in Gorakhpur Division (4 districts) and Basti division in UP, Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, and even Nepal.  - Why do we see a large number of children with AES each year at BRD hospital? There is a lot of scrub typhus fever in the community. Between 20-25 percent of fever in children being attended to at PHCs primary health centres is caused by scrub typhus. Only a small percentage of these children progress to AES. Most of the cases in the community are sub-clinical with no symptoms or very mild fever. Only some children with fever will progress to AES. The hospital sees 1500-2000 cases each year and 80 percent of these cases are during July to October.  About 1/4 of patients with AES are adults. Generally, adults develop immunity against scrub typhus, so only those who have not been exposed to scrub typhus will progress to AES.  - Is there any specific reason why scrub typhus is found only in this region? It is not correct to say it is restricted only to this region. Scrub typhus is found even in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu. In Tamil Nadu it is found in Vellore and Thiruvallur districts. About 7-10 percent of fever in these 2 districts is caused by scrub typhus. The reason why it is found only in these 2 districts in Tamil Nadu is because researchers have investigated for scrub typhus in these 2 districts.  - Is it possible to treat scrub typhus and prevent the infection from progressing to AES? In the beginning of this year 2017, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) recommended to the Uttar Pradesh government to use doxycycline antibiotic to treat children with fever for 5 days. The ICMR shared an algorithm with the Uttar Pradesh government which tells which fever should be treated with doxycycline and the dosage. If treated early with doxycycline, then children will not progress to AES. This prevention strategy has to be implemented widely and even by doctors in the private sector before we see results. In July 2017, ICMR and doctors from the Christian Medical College, Vellore went to Gorakhpur and conducted awareness campaign for Indian Medical Association (IMA) and Indian Association of Paediatrics (IAP) doctors, chief medical officers, and programme officers.  - Why is the death rate high at 20 percent in children with AES? At BRD hospital, we have observed patients with AES. The mortality is about 20 percent due to multi-organ involvement. In the case of AES caused by scrub typhus, the mortality is about 15-17 percent compared with AES caused by JE. This is because treatment started early with azithromycin can treat AES caused by scrub typhus. Azithromycin is in the class of medicines as doxycycline but easy to administer in sick children as it is given intravenously.  - What is vaccine coverage for Japanese encephalitis and why don't we see herd immunity with this vaccine? In 2012, the vaccine coverage for Japanese encephalitis was only 50 percent but has improved to 75 percent now. A study we carried out in 2015 found 75 percent coverage for the 1st dose and only 42 percent for the 2nd dose. 3 of the 4 children aged 25-36 months in Gorakhpur region had received at least one dose of the vaccine. We need 2 doses of the vaccine  during 9-12 months for the 1st dose and 16-24 months for the 2nd dose  for optimal protection. With just one dose, the efficacy is over 80 percent. No studies have been done to find the duration of protection. With increasing vaccine coverage the incidence of JE has dropped from about 20 percent a few years ago to less than 10 percent now.  In the case of mosquito-borne diseases, herd immunity will not play a major role. So increasing the vaccine coverage should be a priority.  Byline: R Prasad   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  As with cases of encephalitis in Uttar Pradesh and other states in northeastern India, as noted in the report above, not all encephalitis cases are due to JE virus infections and are classified as AES with undetermined etiology. AES is a term used for multiple etiologies or often when no etiology has been determined. The report above implicates scrub typhus as a major cause of AES. It is not clear why most of the AES cases are in children, but scrub typhus infections occur in people of all ages.  Scrub typhus in India has been receiving additional attention in recent years. a 2013 review article indicated that scrub typhus is seriously neglected and under-reported ((http://www.ajtmh.org/content/journals/10.4269/ajtmh.13-0064)). ProMED-mail has posted multiple reports of scrub typhus in several Indian states in the past, especially since 2011. For background information, see ProMED-mail post Scrub typhus - India (05): background http://promedmail.org/post/20111208.3546.  The report above indicates that JE vaccination campaigns have been active there this year (2017) but have not provided complete coverage. Other etiologies for AES, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_), lychee fruit consumption, and agricultural-related toxicants have been proposed. The above report is another implicating scrub typhus as an important etiology of the AES cases. However, getting to an accurate diagnosis in these cases of AES will require active field surveillance with epidemiological studies supported by timely laboratory testing. Prospective studies are required to confirm the degree of scrub typhus involvement in AES cases.  Maps of India can be accessed at (http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm).

ProMED-mail has posted multiple reports of scrub typhus in several Indian states, especially since 2011 (3), so that it is not surprising that scrub typhus could account for many cases of acute encephalitis in other Indian states (4). However, I noted at the time in the moderator comments (2) that although headache is a common part of the symptom complex of scrub typhus, acute encephalitis or meningoencephalitis, with a history of altered sensorium, seizures or neck stiffness, and abnormal neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid findings, complicates a minority of scrub typhus cases (5-7).  \nPlease also see prior ProMED-mail posts that have discussed the occurrence of acute encephalitis complicating scrub typhus (Acute encephalitis syndrome - India (03): (UP) comment http://promedmail.org/post/20151011.3707371 and Acute encephalitis syndrome - India (02): (UP) http://promedmail.org/post/20151008.3698951).  1.

The deaths from more than 16 539 cases reported so far in\n2017 represent 94 percent of the overall incidence in the regions of\nAfrica. This follows a major epidemic reported mainly in the North\nKivu province, which is the epicentre of the conflict between rebel\ngroups and the government. In the region, health delivery services have come to a standstill\nowing to the conflict. Civilians have been forced to flee their homes,\nadding to the tens of thousands already living in camps for internally\ndisplaced people. Meanwhile, In West Africa, similarly to 2016, several countries report\nsporadic cases. Terror-ridden Nigeria is also battling a severe\noutbreak of the water borne disease with 20 deaths recorded from 809\ncases in 2017. Liberia, a hotspot for diseases, is also affected with\n6 deaths from 129 cases. There have also been outbreaks in Cameroon,\nGhana and Ivory Cast but no casualties have been reported. Overall,\n488 deaths have been reported from 17 548 cases in the affected\nregions.

Ending the outbreak and preventing its spread beyond Tanzania's\nborders is a high priority for WHO. To that end, WHO and partners\nsupport a well-coordinated multisectoral response through the National\nCholera Task Force which plans, coordinates and support subnational\nauthorities. Indeed, learning requires a continuous assessment of performance, a\nreview of successes and failures and a robust support for improvement.\nAn After Action Review (AAR) is a simple methodology for facilitating\nthis assessment. It provides for a qualitative review of actions taken\nto respond to an emergency as a means of identifying best practices,\ngaps and lessons learned. As a component of the IHR Monitoring and\nEvaluation Framework (IHR MEF) and part of the preparedness and\nresponse cycle, an AAR seeks to identify what worked well or not and\nhow these practices can be maintained, improved, institutionalized and\nshared with relevant stakeholders. It is within this context that WHO\nsupported the Ministry of Health to convene a meeting of experts to\nconduct an After Action Review following the national response to the\ncholera outbreak. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{3}</strong> Cholera - Sudan.\nDate: Thu 17 Aug 2017.\nSource: Radio Dabanga (edited)\n(http://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/cholera-new-deaths-and-infections-across-sudan) \nSinga Hospital in Sudan's Sennar received 16 new cases of cholera\nduring the 1st half of this week week of Sun 13 Aug 2017. A woman\nhas died before she could be transferred to hospital, and 9 others\nwere infected with cholera at El Matateib in North Delta locality in\nSudan's Kassala state. Sennar State\nA medical source told Radio Dabanga that most of the cases in Sennar\ncame from Um Benin village southeast of the city except for 2 cases\nfrom El Dindir and El Souki. From Saturday to Monday 12-14 Aug 2017,\n26 cases of cholera arrived from Um Benin village. This led the local\nhealth authorities to open a new cholera isolation centre at the\nvillage. El Gedaref State\nEl Gedaref Hospital in East Sudan recorded 15 cases of cholera on\nTuesday and Wednesday 15-16 Aug 2017. A medical source told Radio\nDabanga that the hospital received 9 cases on Tue 15 Aug 2017, while\n6 cases were recorded on Wed 16Aug 2017. The medic said that all\ncases of cholera came from Uktuber, El Tadamon, El Geneina, and\nKadugli districts in El Gedaref. Kassala State\nA woman has died before she could be transferred to hospital, and 9\nothers were infected with cholera at El Matateib in North Delta\nlocality in Sudan's Kassala state. Youth activist Mohamed Seyidna told\nRadio Dabanga that \"the woman died in the village before she could be\ntransferred to the hospital\". He said that the hospitalised cases at\nWagar Hospital have risen to 9. He attributed the spread of cholera in the area to water pollution and\ncalled on the health authorities to make efforts to sterilize drinking\nwater and raise awareness of the residents. National epidemic\nThe National Epidemiological Corporation reported in early July 2017\nthat nearly 24 000 Sudanese have been infected and 940 cholera\npatients have died since the outbreak of the infectious disease in\nBlue Nile state in August 2016. The Sudanese authorities however,\nrefuse to call the disease by its name, and instead refer to it as\n\"Acute Watery Diarrhea\". The National Intelligence and Security\nService has repeatedly warned medics and the press in the country not\nto make mention of cholera. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{4}</strong> Cholera - Pakistan (Punjab Province).\nDate: Wed 16 Aug 2017.\nSource: The News (edited)\n(https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/223756-Number-of-cholera-cases-continues-to-swell) \nThe number of cases of cholera, a highly contagious and fatal disease\nis continuously on the rise and there is a threat that spread of the\ninfection may take shape of an epidemic if proper preventive and\ncontrol measures are not taken well in time. The 1st 2 cases of\ncholera were tested positive by National Institute of Health Islamabad\non Mon 31 Jul 2017 and another 2 confirmed positive for the\ninfection on Fri 4 Aug 2017. All the 4 patients were undergoing\ntreatment at Benazir Bhutto Hospital BH where as many as 4 more\nsuspects of the infection have been admitted for treatment. Data collected by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017 reveals that the\nallied hospitals have sent stool samples of over 10 child patients to\nNIH for confirmation of cholera in last week week of Sun 6 Aug\n2017. On Sat 12 Aug 2017, as many as 20 child patients with severe\ndiarrhoea were admitted at the BBH of which 4 were suspected as\npatients of cholera and their stool samples were sent to NIH for\nconfirmation, said Associate Professor of Paediatrics at Rawalpindi\nMedical University Dr Tariq Saeed when contacted by 'The News' on Mon\n14 Aug 2017. He added the hospital has not received confirmation reports from the\nNIH because of holidays there from Saturday to Monday. However, we\nhave been keeping the suspects in isolation under strict monitoring,\nhe said. He added that repeated rainfalls in the region and water inundation\ninside and outside homes in a number of localities particularly in\nthickly populated areas of the city are causing contamination of water\nand foodstuff that increases chances of spread of a number of\ninfections among population while children are at greater risk of\ncontracting life-threatening infections including cholera. It is important that the transmission of cholera occurs primarily by\ndrinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the feces\n(waste product) of an infected person, including one with no apparent\nsymptoms. It is observed that heavy rainfall causes collection of heavily\ncontaminated water in streets and houses and the waste water flooding\nout of various nullahs watercourses including Nullah Leh in town\ncauses infections including cholera, typhoid, dysentery,\ngastroenteritis, hepatitis A and E, shigellosis and giardiasis. Professor Tariq said the consumption of contaminated water and\nfoodstuff causes cholera, an infection in the small intestine caused\nby bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. Its main symptoms are watery diarrhea\nand vomiting that can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte\nimbalance, and death in cases which are not treated in time, he said. Health experts say that to avoid cholera and other infections, one\nmust use boiled water for drinking and should use vegetables after\nwashing with clean water and it must be kept in mind that raw\nvegetables should not be eaten in the existing weather conditions\ninstead these should be used after cooking. To a query, Professor Tariq said the heavy rainfall and water\naccumulation may contaminate water at sources and there may be chances\nof contamination of water at tube wells so individuals must boil water\nbefore drinking to avoid cholera and other infections. He added the appearance of cholera is alarming and it is time for\npeople to take extra ordinary preventive measures to safeguard their\nchildren and themselves from the disease. In case water is accumulated inside home due to heavy rainfall and\nflooded out of sewage lines, it must be wiped out immediately and the\nspace should be washed with clean water as soon as possible to avoid\ninfections. Avoiding inundation of contaminated water inside homes is\na must to avoid cholera and other infections, said Professor Tariq.

The\nfollowing is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In:\nChronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract.\nGreydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in\npress): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons,\nvaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside\nof Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as\n60-80 percent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection\nlengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are: - Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 percent (95 percent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam; - Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however,\nhave suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be\neffective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and\noutbreak situations (63, 64). \"References\n-\n57.

Here we evaluate the risk of Zika virus transmission through\nmucosal contact in rhesus macaques. Application of high-dose Zika\nvirus directly to the tonsils of 3 rhesus macaques results in\ndetectable plasma viremia in all animals by 2 days post-exposure;\nvirus replication kinetics are similar to those observed in animals\ninfected subcutaneously. 3 additional macaques inoculated\nsubcutaneously with Zika virus served as saliva donors to assess the\ntransmission risk from contact with oral secretions from an infected\nindividual. 7 naive animals repeatedly exposed to donor saliva via the\nconjunctivae, tonsils, or nostrils did not become infected. Our\nresults suggest that there is a risk of Zika virus transmission via\nthe mucosal route, but that the risk posed by oral secretions from\nindividuals with a typical course of Zika virus infection is low. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall It is good to learn that Zika virus transmission via mucosa is\nunlikely.

Update: Interim guidance\nfor health care providers caring for pregnant women with possible Zika\nvirus exposure  United States (including US Territories), July 2017.\nMMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2017; 66(29): 781-93. doi:\n10.15585/mmwr.mm6629e1\n-\nCDC has updated the interim guidance for US health care providers\ncaring for pregnant women with possible Zika virus exposure in\nresponse to 1) declining prevalence of Zika virus disease in the World\nHealth Organization's Region of the Americas (Americas) and 2)\nemerging evidence indicating prolonged detection of Zika virus\nimmunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies. Zika virus cases were 1st reported\nin the Americas during 2015-2016; however, the incidence of Zika virus\ndisease has since declined. As the prevalence of Zika virus disease\ndeclines, the likelihood of false-positive test results increases. In\naddition, emerging epidemiologic and laboratory data indicate that, as\nis the case with other flaviviruses, Zika virus IgM antibodies can\npersist beyond 12 weeks after infection. Therefore, IgM test results\ncannot always reliably distinguish between an infection that occurred\nduring the current pregnancy and one that occurred before the current\npregnancy, particularly for women with possible Zika virus exposure\nbefore the current pregnancy. These limitations should be considered\nwhen counseling pregnant women about the risks and benefits of testing\nfor Zika virus infection during pregnancy. This updated guidance\nemphasizes a shared decision-making model for testing and screening\npregnant women, one in which patients and providers work together to\nmake decisions about testing and care plans based on patient\npreferences and values, clinical judgment, and a balanced assessment\nof risks and expected outcomes. For these recommendations, the definition of possible Zika virus\nexposure has not changed and includes travel to, or residence in an\narea with risk for mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission or sex with\na partner who has traveled to or resides in an area with risk for\nmosquito-borne Zika virus transmission. These areas can be found on\nthe CDC \"Zika Travel Information\" webpage. Key recommendations include the following:\n1- All pregnant women in the United States and US territories should\nbe asked about possible Zika virus exposure before and during the\ncurrent pregnancy, at every prenatal care visit. CDC recommends that\npregnant women not travel to any area with risk for Zika virus\ntransmission. It is also recommended that pregnant women with a sex\npartner who has traveled to or lives in an area with risk for Zika\nvirus transmission use condoms or abstain from sex for the duration of\nthe pregnancy.\n2- Pregnant women with recent possible Zika virus exposure and\nsymptoms of Zika virus disease should be tested to diagnose the cause\nof their symptoms. The updated recommendations include concurrent Zika\nvirus nucleic acid test (NAT) and serologic testing as soon as\npossible through 12 weeks after symptom onset.\n3- Asymptomatic pregnant women with ongoing possible Zika virus\nexposure should be offered Zika virus NAT testing 3 times during\npregnancy. IgM testing is no longer routinely recommended because IgM\ncan persist for months after infection; therefore, IgM results cannot\nreliably determine whether an infection occurred during the current\npregnancy. The optimal timing and frequency of testing of asymptomatic\npregnant women with NAT alone is unknown. For pregnant women who have\nreceived a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection (by\neither NAT or serology positive/equivocal Zika virus or dengue virus\nIgM and Zika virus plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) 10 and\nhigher and dengue virus PRNT less than 10 results) any time before or\nduring the current pregnancy, additional Zika virus testing is not\nrecommended. For pregnant women without a prior laboratory-confirmed\ndiagnosis of Zika virus, NAT testing should be offered at the\ninitiation of prenatal care, and if Zika virus RNA is not detected on\nclinical specimens, 2 additional tests should be offered during the\ncourse of the pregnancy coinciding with prenatal visits.\n4- Asymptomatic pregnant women who have recent possible Zika virus\nexposure (that is, through travel or sexual exposure) but without\nongoing possible exposure are not routinely recommended to have Zika\nvirus testing. Testing should be considered using a shared\npatient-provider decision-making model, one in which patients and\nproviders work together to make decisions about testing and care plans\nbased on patient preferences and values, clinical judgment, a balanced\nassessment of risks and expected outcomes, and the jurisdiction's\nrecommendations. Based on the epidemiology of Zika virus transmission\nand other epidemiologic considerations (such as, seasonality),\njurisdictions might recommend testing of asymptomatic pregnant women,\neither for clinical care or as part of Zika virus surveillance. With\nthe decline in the prevalence of Zika virus disease, the updated\nrecommendations for the evaluation and testing of pregnant women with\nrecent possible Zika virus exposure but without ongoing possible\nexposure are now the same for all areas with any risk for Zika virus\ntransmission.\n5- Pregnant women who have recent possible Zika virus exposure and who\nhave a fetus with prenatal ultrasound findings consistent with\ncongenital Zika virus syndrome should receive Zika virus testing to\nassist in establishing the etiology of the birth defects. Testing\nshould include both NAT and IgM tests.\n6- The comprehensive approach to testing placental and fetal tissues\nhas been updated. Testing placental and fetal tissue specimens can be\nperformed for diagnostic purposes in certain scenarios (e.g., women\nwithout a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection and\nwho have a fetus or infant with possible Zika virus-associated birth\ndefects). However, testing of placental tissues for Zika virus\ninfection is not routinely recommended for asymptomatic pregnant women\nwho have recent possible Zika virus exposure but without ongoing\npossible exposure and who have a live born infant without evidence of\npossible Zika virus-associated birth defects.\n7- Zika virus IgM testing as part of preconception counseling to\nestablish baseline IgM results for non pregnant women with ongoing\npossible Zika virus exposure is not warranted because Zika virus IgM\ntesting is no longer routinely recommended for asymptomatic pregnant\nwomen with ongoing possible Zika virus exposure. also at the source URL above:\nAdditional interim guidance:\n- Laboratory testing of pregnant women with exposure to areas with\nrisk for Zika virus transmission\n- Prenatal management of pregnant women with laboratory evidence of\npossible Zika virus infection\n- Evaluation of placental and fetal tissue specimens for Zika virus\ninfection \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org)\nand\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be)(promed@promedmail.org) Readers interested in accessing the full report can find it at the\nsource URL above.

What is the spectrum of neurologic manifestations in adults\nwith Zika virus infection?\nFindings. This cohort study evaluated adult patients with new-onset\nparainfectious or neuroinflammatory disease for the presence of acute\nZika virus infection in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples\nusing molecular and serological testing. An increase in the incidence\nof Guillain-Barré syndrome and encephalitis was observed compared\nwith the period before the outbreak of the Zika virus.\nMeaning The Zika virus may be associated with a rapid increase in the\nincidence of life-threatening neurologic syndromes; serologic and\nmolecular testing using blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples can\nserve as an alternative diagnostic strategy. Abstract\n\nImportance. There are no prospective cohort studies assessing the\nincidence and spectrum of neurologic manifestations secondary to Zika\nvirus (ZIKV) infection in adults.\nObjective. To evaluate the rates of acute ZIKV infection among\npatients hospitalized with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS),\nmeningoencephalitis, or transverse myelitis.\nDesign, setting, and participants. A prospective, observational cohort\nstudy was conducted at a tertiary referral center for neurological\ndiseases in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between 5 Dec 2015-10 May 2016,\namong consecutive hospitalized adults (older than 18 years of age)\nwith new-onset acute parainfectious or neuroinflammatory disease. All\nparticipants were tested for a series of arbovirosis. 3-month\nfunctional outcome was assessed.\nInterventions. Samples of serum and cerebrospinal fluid were tested\nfor ZIKV using real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain\nreaction and an IgM antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent\nassay. Clinical, radiographic (magnetic resonance imaging),\nelectrophysiological, and 3-month functional outcome data were\ncollected.\nMain outcomes and measures. The detection of neurologic complications\nsecondary to ZIKV infection.\nResults. 40 patients (15 women and 25 men; median age, 44 years\nrange, 22-72 years) were enrolled, including 29 patients (73\npercent) with GBS (90 percent Brighton level 1 certainty), 7 (18\npercent) with encephalitis, 3 (8 percent) with transverse myelitis,\nand 1 (3 percent) with newly diagnosed chronic inflammatory\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy. Of these, 35 patients (88 percent) had\nmolecular and/or serologic evidence of recent ZIKV infection in the\nserum and/or cerebrospinal fluid. Of the patients positive for ZIKV\ninfection, 27 had GBS (18 demyelinating, 8 axonal, and 1 Miller Fisher\nsyndrome), 5 had encephalitis (3 with concomitant acute neuromuscular\ndisease), 2 had transverse myelitis, and 1 had chronic inflammatory\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy. Admission to the intensive care unit was\nrequired for 9 patients positive for ZIKV infection (26 percent), and\n5 (14 percent) required mechanical ventilation. Compared with\nadmission during the period from 5 Dec 2013 - 10 May 2014 (before the\nBrazilian outbreak of ZIKV), admissions for GBS increased from a mean\nof 1.0 per month to 5.6 per month, admissions for encephalitis\nincreased from 0.4 per month to 1.4 per month, and admissions for\ntransverse myelitis remained constant at 0.6 per month. At 3 months, 2\npatients positive for ZIKV infection (6 percent) died (1 with GBS and\n1 with encephalitis), 18 (51 percent) had chronic pain, and the median\nmodified Rankin score among survivors was 2 (range, 0-5).\nConclusions and relevance. In this single-center Brazilian cohort,\nZIKV infection was associated with an increase in the incidence of a\ndiverse spectrum of serious neurologic syndromes. The data also\nsuggest that serologic and molecular testing using blood and\ncerebrospinal fluid samples can serve as a less expensive, alternative\ndiagnostic strategy in developing countries, where plaque reduction\nneutralization testing is impractical. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) This study illustrates the need to consider post-Zika virus infection\nas a cause of a variety of neurological diseases.

We found that ZIKV\npersistently infects brain endothelial cells that normally protect\nneurons from viral exposure. hBMECs are not damaged by ZIKV infection\nand, analogous to persistent HCV infection, ZIKV constitutively\ninduces and evades antiviral ISG IFN-stimulated genes and IFN\ninterferon responses to continuously replicate in hBMECs. As a\nresult, hBMECs provide a protective niche for systemic ZIKV spread and\na viral reservoir localized in the normally protective blood-brain\nbarrier.

PLoS\nPathog. 2017; 13(8): e1006487. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006487\n-\nAbstract\n\nStudies have demonstrated cross-reactivity of anti-dengue virus (DENV)\nantibodies in human sera against Zika virus (ZIKV), promoting\nincreased ZIKV infection in vitro. However, the correlation between in\nvitro and in vivo findings is not well characterized. Thus, we\nevaluated the impact of heterotypic flavivirus immunity on ZIKV titers\nin biofluids of rhesus macaques. Animals previously infected (420 days\nor longer) with DENV2, DENV4, or yellow fever virus were compared to\nflavivirus-naïve animals following infection with a Brazilian ZIKV\nstrain. Sera from DENV-immune macaques demonstrated cross-reactivity\nwith ZIKV by antibody-binding and neutralization assays prior to ZIKV\ninfection, and promoted increased ZIKV infection in cell culture\nassays. Despite these findings, no significant differences between\nflavivirus-naïve and immune animals were observed in viral titers,\nneutralizing antibody levels, or immune cell kinetics following ZIKV\ninfection. These results indicate that prior infection with\nheterologous flaviviruses neither conferred protection nor increased\nobserved ZIKV titers in this non-human primate ZIKV infection model. Author summary\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne, emerging flavivirus. In\naddition to asymptomatic or mild febrile manifestations, ZIKV\ninfection in humans is associated with comparatively rare congenital\nand neurological abnormalities. Previous in vitro studies have\ndemonstrated cross-reactivity of antibodies derived from dengue virus\ninfections with ZIKV, as well as antibody-mediated enhancement of\ninfection in cell culture. Therefore, there is concern among\nvaccinologists and the public health community that the more severe\ndisease manifestations could result from prior immunity, either from\nnatural infection or vaccination, to antigenically-related\nflaviviruses (such as, dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis).\nIn this study, we evaluated the impact of prior immunity to dengue or\nyellow fever virus on ZIKV infection in a non-human primate model.\nAfter confirming that our immune cohorts were capable of\nrecapitulating the published in vitro observations of cross-reactivity\nand enhancement, we looked for alteration of viral titers in\nperipheral blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, and vaginal\nsecretions, as well as alterations in gross pathology, clinical\nparameters, and immune response, as compared to our flavivirus-naïve\ncohort. Importantly, no significant differences between\nflavivirus-naïve and primed animals were observed in viral titers or\nbiofluid distribution, neutralizing antibody levels, or immune cell\nkinetics following ZIKV infection. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org)\nand\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be)(promed@promedmail.org) Previous dengue infection, whether acquired naturally or antibody\nelicited by vaccines, has been a concern due to the possibility of\nantibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) with more severe disease. This\nconcern also relates to Zika virus antibody from vaccination for\nenhancement of dengue virus infections with resulting more severe\ndisease. The monkey studies reported above indicated that this may not\nbe a problem for Zika virus vaccinated individuals. Another effort to\navoid ADE is development of a vaccine that has epitopes specific for\nZika virus that are not shared by other flaviviruses. A group of\nresearchers developed a recombinant vaccine targeting a viral envelope\nsub-unit specific to the Zika virus\n((http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/news-and-analysis/news-in-brief/researchers-find-way-to-overcome-zika-vaccinedengue-virus-conundrum/20203379.article)).\nRoland Hübner is thanked for calling this latter reference to our\nattention. - Mod.TY \n<br><br><strong>{8}</strong> Virus inhibition.\nDate: 25 Jul 2017.\nSource: Nature Communications (edited)\n(https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15672) \nref: Yu Y, Deng YQ, Zou P, et al.

PLoS Pathog. 2017; 13(7): e1006537. doi:\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1006537\n-\nAbstract\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted virus that can cause\nsevere defects in an infected fetus. ZIKV is also transmitted by\nsexual contact, although the relative importance of sexual\ntransmission is unclear. To better understand the role of sexual\ntransmission in ZIKV pathogenesis, a nonhuman primate (NHP) model of\nvaginal transmission was developed. ZIKV was readily transmitted to\nmature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by vaginal inoculation was\nreadily transmitted to mature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by\nvaginal individual RM with 1-5 vaginal inoculations required to\nestablish infection. After treatment with Depoprovera, a widely used\ncontraceptive progestin, 2 RM that initially resisted 8 vaginal ZIKV\ninoculations became infected after one ZIKV inoculation. Thus,\nDepoprovera seemed to enhance susceptibility to vaginal ZIKV\ntransmission. Unexpectedly, the kinetics of virus replication and\ndissemination after intravaginal ZIKV inoculation were markedly\ndifferent from RM infected with ZIKV by subcutaneous (SQ) virus\ninoculation. Several groups have reported that after SQ ZIKV\ninoculation vRNA is rapidly detected in blood plasma with vRNA less\ncommon in urine and saliva and only rarely detected in female\nreproductive tract (FRT) secretions. In contrast, in vaginally\ninoculated RM, plasma vRNA is delayed for several days and ZIKV\nreplication in, and vRNA shedding from, the FRT was found in all 6\nanimals. Further, after intravaginal transmission ZIKV RNA shedding\nfrom FRT secretions was detected before or simultaneously with plasma\nvRNA, and persisted for at least as long. Thus, ZIKV replication in\nthe FRT was independent of, and often preceded virus replication in\nthe tissues contributing to plasma vRNA. These results support the\nconclusion that ZIKV preferentially replicates in the FRT after\nvaginal transmission, but not after SQ transmission, and raise the\npossibility that there is enhanced fetal infection and pathology after\nvaginal ZIKV transmission compared to a mosquito transmitted ZIKV. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{10}</strong> _Aedes albopictus_ populations as vectors.\nDate: 2 Aug 2017.\nSource: American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (edited)\n(http://www.ajtmh.org/content/journals/10.4269/ajtmh.16-0969) \nref: Azar SR, Roundy CM, Rossi SL, et al.

Positive saliva samples were assayed for\ninfectious titer. Although all 3 mosquito populations were susceptible\nto all ZIKV strains, rates of infection, dissemination, and\ntransmission differed among mosquito and virus strains. _Aedes\nalbopictus_ from Salvador, Brazil, were the least efficient vectors,\ndemonstrating susceptibility to infection to 2 American strains of\nZIKV but failing to shed virus in saliva. Mosquitoes from the Rio\nGrande Valley were the most efficient vectors and were capable of\nshedding all 3 tested ZIKV strains into saliva after 14 days of\nextrinsic incubation. In particular, ZIKV strain DakAR 41525 (Senegal\n1954) was significantly more efficient at dissemination and saliva\ndeposition than the others tested in Rio Grande mosquitoes.

Emerg Microbes\nInfect. 2017; 6(8): e69. doi: 10.1038/emi.2017.59\n-\nAbstract\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has recently been associated\nwith an increased incidence of neonatal microcephaly and other\nneurological disorders. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito\nbite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some\ncases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main\nvector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other\nmosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the\nvirus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit\nZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of\nlaboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_.\nInterestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the\nmidgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in\nRecife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially\nfed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced.\nCollectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range\nof ZIKV vectors than anticipated. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be) Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active\nvirus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their\nability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step\ntoward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_\nfed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in\nsaliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing.\nThe study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a\ncompetent vector. Several other studies have shown this species to be\ninefficient vectors or refractory to Zika virus infection. One wonders\nif the specific _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ used or the Zika virus isolates\nwith which they were tested could account for these very different\nresults. Resolving these discrepancies is important because this\nmosquito species is very widely distributed around the world and bears\ndirectly on risk of outbreaks in geographic areas where _Aedes\naegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_ , Zika virus vectors, do not occur. -\nMod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"49":{"title":"Chlorine gas - India: (UT) waterworks, RFI ","date":["18","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Chlorine gas - India: (UT) waterworks, RFI [EXTERNAL]","summary":" A ProMED-mail post (http://www.promedmail.org) ProMED-mail is a program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases (http://www.isid.org) .

Maps of India can be seen at (http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm) and (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1475).  Chlorine gas is a pulmonary irritant with intermediate water solubility that causes acute damage in the upper and lower respiratory tract.  Exposure to low concentrations of chlorine for prolonged periods may have destructive effects, as might very short-term exposure to high concentrations.  Long-term complications may occur after breathing in high concentrations of chlorine. Complications are more likely to be seen in people who develop severe health problems such as fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema) following the initial exposure.  How chlorine works - The extent of poisoning caused by chlorine depends on the amount of chlorine a person is exposed to, how the person was exposed, and the length of time of the exposure. - When chlorine gas comes into contact with moist tissues such as the eyes, throat, and lungs, an acid is produced that can damage these tissues.  Immediate signs and symptoms of chlorine exposure During or immediately after exposure to dangerous concentrations of chlorine, the following signs and symptoms may develop: - blurred vision; - burning pain, redness, and blisters on the skin if exposed to gas. Skin injuries similar to frostbite can occur if it is exposed to liquid chlorine; - burning sensation in the nose, throat, and eyes; - coughing; - chest tightness; - difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. These may appear immediately if high concentrations of chlorine gas are inhaled, or they may be delayed if low concentrations of chlorine gas are inhaled; - fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema) that may be delayed for a few hours; - nausea and vomiting; - watery eyes; - wheezing  Long-term health effects Long-term complications may occur after breathing in high concentrations of chlorine.

While swine flu and dengue are spreading in the urban areas, the tribal hinterland has been beset with outbreaks of encephalitis since 2012. Though no Japanese encephalitis (JE) mortalities have been registered as yet in the official records, 473 acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) cases have been diagnosed so far. Odisha stands 5th in AES mortality after Uttar Pradesh, Assam, West Bengal and Bihar.  According to the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, AES had taken 13 lives by the 1st week of August 2017. Apart from AES, 8 persons have fallen victim to swine flu in Odisha in the last 2 weeks. More than 100 positive cases have been detected. Dengue is the other scourge in the state with 2 deaths and 367 positive cases.  Both AES and JE have been regular in Odisha since 2012. Last year, the state grabbed the national headlines when 115 children died of AES and 42 fell to JE. Most of the deaths were reported from Malkangiri district.  But the state government has been equivocating on the incidence of AES. It went to the extent of claiming that consumption of seeds of a plant called _Cassia occidentalis_, locally known as Bada Chakunda, caused death of a 3rd of the children who fell to encephalitis in Malkangiri district.  An expert committee suggested that JE could not be blamed for all the deaths because \"encephalopathy\" was the culprit. Encephalopathy, it said, is a non-infectious biochemical syndrome that can be aggravated by the consumption of _Cassia_ seeds. The fact is the Naveen Patnaik government remained aloof to the spread of AES, which is caused by a vector-borne virus hosted by pigs.  The Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC), Bhubaneswar, carried out a study on the outbreak of AES in Malkangiri in 2015 but its findings were not paid heed to. From 38 deaths in 2012 to 115 in 2016, the AES surge was waiting to happen.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  As of the end of May 2017, there were 313 cases of AES with 10 deaths in Odisha and now the case count is 473 with 13 deaths in the 1st week of August 2017. Odisha state is endemic for Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus, and cases occur there frequently. As with cases of encephalitis mentioned above and in other states in northeastern India, not all encephalitis cases are due to JE virus and are classified as acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) with undetermined etiology.  As noted in previous ProMED-mail comments, AES is a term used for multiple etiologies or often when no etiology has been determined. The encephalitis picture in northeastern India is complicated. Although JE virus etiology of some previously reported encephalitis cases has been confirmed by laboratory tests, many cases go undiagnosed, or JE virus infection is ruled out, and other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus (_O. tsutsugamushi_) and lychee fruit consumption, have been proposed.  \nHowever, in November 2016 the Odisha state government formed the 6-member panel, led by eminent virologist Dr Jacob John from Vellore's Christian Medical College. In the interim report, Dr John said that anthraquinone, a toxin found in the plant _Cassia occidentalis_, was found in the urine sample of 5 deceased children. \"This indicates that the children (had) consumed the seeds of the plant,\" he said. Getting to an accurate diagnosis in these cases of AES will require active field surveillance with epidemiological studies supported by timely laboratory testing.

Given the\noutbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections in the region, and the\nclinical similarity of cases of that virus infection and CHIKV\ninfection, one wonders how many cases that were not laboratory\nconfirmed but clinically diagnosed as ZIKV infections were, in\nreality, CHIKV infections. It is also possible that a significant\nproportion of the population have been infected by CHIKV in the\nprevious 3 years and are now immune. It seems likely, however, that\nCHIKV is now endemic in the Americas, and sporadic, small outbreaks\nmay continue to occur as they do in Asia and Africa. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"75":{"title":"Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (88): Africa,\r\n\tAsia ","date":["22","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (88): Africa,\r\n\tAsia [EXTERNAL]","summary":"\nCHOLERA, DIARRHEA AND DYSENTERY UPDATE (88): AFRICA, ASIA\n*\nA ProMED-mail post\n(http://www.promedmail.org)\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n(http://www.isid.org) In this update:\nAfrica\n\n<br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Cholera - Malawi (Southern region)\n2,3 Cholera - Sudan\n<br><br><strong>{4}</strong> Cholera - Congo DR (Kwilu, South Kivu)\nAsia\n\n<br><br><strong>{5}</strong> Cholera - India (Punjab)\n<br><br><strong>{6}</strong> Diarrhea - Nepal (Kapilvastu district) \n<br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Cholera - Malawi (Southern region).\nDate: Mon 21 Aug 2017.\nSource: Capital Radio Malawi summ., edited\n(https://www.capitalradiomalawi.com/index.php/blog/local-news/local-news/item/8352-chikwawa-hit-by-cholera-outbreak) \nA total of 9 people are admitted to Chikwawa district Southern\nregion hospital following a cholera outbreak.

Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:\n- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit.

This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses.

The students are from Sangmyung University's Cheonan Campus in South Chungcheong Province, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Mon 21 Aug 2017. They had visited India's northern region, including the cities of Agra and New Delhi, with 18 other students and 2 instructors as part of the school's overseas education program from 19 to 27 Jul 2017.  After they returned, 7 sought medical attention for fever, chills, and diarrhea. 4 were diagnosed with typhoid. In a follow-up check, another student was diagnosed with the disease. 4 of the 5 students remain in a hospital. One student was released on Fri 18 Aug 2017.  Of 225 Koreans who caught typhoid fever abroad between 2011-2016, 23 per cent had visited India. The health authority has advised that people planning to visit India should be vaccinated against the waterborne disease, which is also infectious through food.  Health officials also said that people who experience fever, chills, and diarrhea within 60 days  the disease's maximum latency period  after returning from India must report to a hospital to be checked for the disease.  byline: Ko Dong-hwan   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  Typhoid fever, so-called enteric fever caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi, often has a totally different presentation from that of the commoner kinds of salmonellosis. Epidemiologically, usually spread by contaminated food or water, typhoid is not a zoonosis like the commoner types of salmonellosis. Clinically, vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent; indeed, constipation is frequently reported. As it is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive.  The symptoms of classical typhoid fever typically include fever, anorexia, lethargy, malaise, dull continuous headache, non-productive cough, vague abdominal pain, and constipation. Despite the often high fever, the pulse is often only slightly elevated. During the 2nd week of the illness, there is protracted fever and mental dullness, classically called coma vigil. Diarrhea may develop but usually does not. Many patients develop hepatosplenomegaly both liver and spleen enlarged. After the 1st week or so, many cases develop a maculopapular rash on the upper abdomen. These lesions (\"rose spots\") are about 2 cm 0.78 in in diameter and blanch on pressure. They persist for 2-4 days and may come and go. Mild and atypical infections are common.  The word typhoid (as in typhus-like) reflects the similarity of the louseborne rickettsial disease epidemic typhus and that of typhoid fever; in fact, in some areas, typhoid fever is still referred to as abdominal typhus.

(promed@promedmail.org)  According to the Nepal page on WRLFMD website, the last occurrence of FMD serotype A in Nepal took place in 1997. Since 2010, and as of March 2017, the FMDV strain circulating in Nepal has continuously been O/ME-SA/Ind-2001d (in 2015, there was also a single detection of O/ME-SA/PanAsia-2 KAT-15). For the said and additional information on Nepal's FMD past records, including genotyping results (though not yet of the newly introduced A/ASIA/G-VII lineage), see (http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/asia/nep.htm).  The identification of the A/ASIA/G-VII lineage in Nepal represents further spread of this virus, which had been evolving in India many years back (\"A/IND/40/2000\", genotyped A/ASIA/G-VII, was collected in 1999). In 2010, this strain was detected in Myanmar. In 2015, it appeared for the 1st time in the Middle East (\"FMD Pool 3\"), being detected in Saudi Arabia followed, during the same year, by Iran, Turkey and Armenia. Most recently (May 2017), this virus was identified in Northern Israel, on the Lebanese and Syrian borders.  According to the information included in the Guest Editor's comments to EuFMD's (European Commission for the control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease) monthly report \"Global Foot-and-Mouth Disease Situation\", June 2017, there were reports of poor performance of vaccine strains derived from the A/ASIA/Iran-05 strain against the A/ASIA/G-VII lineage. The guest editor, Don King (head of the Vesicular Disease Reference Laboratory Group in the Pirbright Institute and WRLFMD), disclosed that WRLFMD, in partnership with the FMD Reference Laboratories in Lelystad (The Netherlands) and Geelong (Australia), has undertaken vaccine potency trials for alternative candidate vaccines; preliminary data indicated that the A-May-97 vaccine may provide protection in cattle, in contrast to the A22 vaccine, which does not appear to induce a protective response. The said data were to \"be presented in more detail shortly\". The said and additional information is available at (http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd/docs/FMD_monthly_reports/2017/June2017.pdf).  The Indian subcontinent (\"FMD Pool 2\") is the source of 2 FMD strains which have demonstrated, in recent years, a long-distance (trans-regional) transmission, causing losses in \"FMD Pool 3\" countries and threatening Europe. These are FMDV serotype O, topotype ME-SA, strain Ind-2001d and FMDV serotype A, topotype Asia, genotype (strain) VII. While the routes of dissemination are yet to be clarified, the FMD situation within India, a major beef exporter, including its vaccination policy and vaccines efficacy, deserves being visited. - Mod.AS  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/19830).

As a precautionary measure, as many as 100 blood samples of horses have been taken so far and sent for testing.  The infectious disease is caused by a bacterium which spreads from animal to animal. Humans who come in contact with the affected animals can also contract this disease. There are 6000 horses and other equines in the district. The detection of the disease has spread panic among owners.  Giving details, deputy chief veterinary officer Yogendra Panwar said, \"In 2011, some 5 horses were diagnosed with this disease in Chandpur area of Bijnor district. They were put to sleep to save other equines. Since then, our department has been running a drive in this regard to make horse owners aware about this disease. We have been taking blood samples of horses repeatedly in the district. Last month July 2017, 2 horses were diagnosed with Glanders in Najibabad area. Both horses had to be killed by a team of veterinary doctors..\"  The veterinary officer explained since there is no known treatment or vaccine for Glanders, an animal that tests positive is put to sleep to prevent the disease from spreading. It is a fatal disease. Government compensates the equine owner after killing a sick animal. The compensation for horses and mules range from Rs 16 000 to Rs 25 000 USD 250.00 to 390.00 he added.  byline: Harveer Dabas   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  India and Brazil are known to lead the list of countries where glanders, a zoonotic, OIE-listed equids disease, is endemic. Media reports on cases of the traditionally fearsome glanders, are often published by the Indian press. This is not fully reflected in India's official reports to the OIE. According to the recent ones, the annual numbers of recorded glanders outbreaks (in equidae) countrywide were as follows: 2010 - 1; 2011 - 3; 2012 - 1; 2013 - 1; 2014 - 0; 2015 - 5. During the 1st semester of 2016, 9 outbreaks were reported, involving 45 cases of which 36 died. India's OIE semi-annual report for the period Jul-Dec 2016 is not yet available.  No statistics on the incidence of glanders in humans in India could be obtained.  Glanders is a contagious and fatal disease of horses, donkeys, and mules, caused by infection with the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_. The pathogen causes nodules and ulcerations in the upper respiratory tract and lungs. A skin form also occurs, known as 'farcy'. Control of glanders requires testing of suspect clinical cases, screening of apparently normal equids, and elimination of reactors. _B. mallei_ can be transmitted to humans, but such cases, which were known to be often fatal, have become rather uncommon (see ref 1). In view of its zoonotic potential, all infected or contaminated (or potentially infected or contaminated) material must be handled in a laboratory with appropriate biosafety and biosecurity controls following a biorisk analysis.  The above and additional information on glanders, its causative agent and its diagnosis is available at (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.05.11_GLANDERS.pdf). A useful updated review on the disease, including its recent global distribution, is available in ref 1.  No vaccine against this disease is available.

This came about after 2\nkidney recipients in Taiwan were diagnosed with dengue 2 days after\nreceiving a kidney each from the same donor, said National Cheng Kung\nUniversity microbiology and immunology professor Dr Oscar Perng\nGuey-chuen. \"This indicates a potential risk,\" the Taiwan-based\nscientist said, adding that no dengue virus was detected in the\ndonor's blood. He said the donor contracted dengue in 2015 and in mid-2016, he died\nin an accident. His family donated his corneas, liver, heart, and\nkidneys. Both patients had the same strain of the dengue virus the\ndonor had in 2015 and one of the recipients died of dengue\nhaemorrhagic fever, he said. Asked where the virus could be hiding since it could not be detected\nin the blood, he said it was a question scientists are trying to\nanswer. Interestingly, those who received the donor's corneas, liver,\nand heart did not develop dengue, Dr Perng said on the sidelines of\nthe National Dengue And Arboviruses Infection Conference 2017\nyesterday 12 Aug 2017. He said although there was not enough\nevidence to show the virus came from the donor as the kidneys were not\ntested for dengue before the transplant, the same virus was found in\nthe patients' bodies after that. Dr Perng said his team had studied mice for dengue virus in the blood\ntestes, kidney, liver, spleen and brain, and found the virus present\nin the kidneys and brain. \"We believe the virus probably resided in\nthe kidneys and was not cleared by the body,\" he said, adding that the\nvirus could have been activated after transplant. He said this raised\nconcerns about asymptomatic people who are dengue carriers. Health Ministry deputy director, general Datuk Dr S Jeyaindran said\npatients with severe dengue would have better recovery if they were\ngiven colloids, a more concentrated fluid, at the early stage in fluid\nmanagement for dengue patients. Dr Jeyaindran, who was representing\nHealth Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam, said colloids may be\nintroduced at an earlier stage, instead of saline because it has not\nbeen successful in treating patients with severe dengue. He said more\nstudies will be conducted to find out at which stage the colloids\nshould be given. byline: Loh Foon Fong \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) - Air travel related spread of dengue.\nDate: Thu 3 Aug 2017.\nSource: Medical Xpress (edited)\n(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-08-air-responsible-dengue-asia.html) \nWhile the incidences of many other infectious diseases have declined\nover the past decade, the number of cases and outbreaks of dengue\nvirus have continued to increase. The spread of dengue to new areas is\nlikely due in large part to trends in air travel, researchers now\nreport in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Dengue virus affects as estimated 390 million people around the globe\neach year, and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild fever and\nheadache to severe low blood pressure. The virus has mostly caused\ndisease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, but a 2014\noutbreak in Japan broke that pattern. Overall, the geographic area\naffected by dengue has been growing in recent years. In the new work, Huaiyu Tian and Bing Xu, both of Beijing Normal\nUniversity, China, together with colleagues from the University of\nOxford and elsewhere analyzed the spread of dengue viruses in Asia\nfrom 1956 to 2015. They used 2202 genetic sequences of dengue viruses,\ncollected in 20 countries or regions of Asia over the 59 years, to\ndetermine how different strains were related. They also investigated\ntrends in air travel, maritime mobility, migration, and\nsocio-economics to determine what factors impact the spread of\ndengue. The spread of 3 different dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1, -2, and -3,\nis associated with air traffic more so than any other factors, the\ndata revealed. Air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India, the\nresearchers found, help seed dengue epidemics, while China, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, and Singapore help diffuse the virus to other Asian\ncountries. \"Future trends in global mobility could potentially accelerate the\nappearance and diffusion of DENV worldwide,\" the researchers say.\n\"Prevention and control of dengue epidemics requires a better\nunderstanding of its mode of geographic dissemination, especially for\ncountries in the tropics.\" Reference: Tian H, Sun Z, Faria NR, et al.

The good news is that with increased vaccination, the numbers of Japanese (JE) cases have declined. The not so good news is that the numbers of undiagnosed acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) cases have increased.  AES continues to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_), and lychee fruit consumption. Recently, scrub typhus has been implicated in many AES cases. Clearly, prospective studies are needed to define the causes of AES.

Date: Mon 28 Aug 2017.\nSource: New York Times (edited)\n(https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/28/health/fda-stem-cell.html?_r=1) \nThe FDA US Food and Drug Administration announced a crackdown on\ndangerous stem cell clinics on Mon 28 Aug 2017, while at the same\ntime pledging to ease the path to approval for companies and doctors\nwith legitimate treatments in the growing field. The agency reported\nactions against 2 large stem cell clinics and a biotech company,\nsaying that it was critical to shut down \"unscrupulous actors\" in\nregenerative medicine, a broad umbrella that includes stem cell and\ngene therapies and immunotherapies. \"The FDA will not allow deceitful\nactors to take advantage of vulnerable patients by purporting to have\ntreatments or cures for serious diseases without any proof that they\nactually work,\" said Dr Scott Gottlieb, the FDA commissioner. Stem cells, which can be extracted from bone marrow, blood, or fat,\ncan develop into many different types of cells, and are thought to\nhave the potential to repair or replace tissue damaged by disease,\ninjury, or aging. But so far, the FDA has approved only a few\nstem-cell products. The companies that the FDA cited have been performing liposuction to\nremove belly fat from patients, extracting stem cells and then\ninjecting those cells back into the patients to treat various\nailments. On Fri 25 Aug 2017, the agency said, federal marshals seized 500\ndoses of live vaccinia virus vaccine for smallpox belonging to\nStemImmune Inc., a San Diego firm that develops stem cell-based\nimmunotherapies for cancer. The raid came after the FDA learned that\nthe vaccine was being used to create an unapproved stem cell product,\na combination of excess amounts of vaccine and stem cells derived from\nbody fat, which was then administered to cancer patients with\npotentially compromised immune systems. The FDA said patients at the\nCalifornia Stem Cell Treatment Centers in Rancho Mirage and Beverly\nHills, California, received the treatment made with the smallpox\nvaccine. It also said it had serious concerns about how StemImmune\nobtained the vaccine for use in an unapproved and potentially\ndangerous treatment. StemImmune obtained at least some of the vaccine from the CDC,\naccording to Thomas Skinner, a CDC spokesman. In its request, the\ncompany said it was conducting cancer research involving the vaccinia\nvirus, and needed to vaccinate researchers  a seemingly legitimate\nreason. The company did not tell the CDC that it was going to inject\nthe vaccine into patients, he said. A statement from StemImmune said\nthe company had lawfully obtained the drug. The FDA also issued a warning letter to US Stem Cell, a private clinic\nin Sunrise, Florida. The company was the subject of a March 2017\nreport in The New England Journal of Medicine, describing how one\nwoman went blind and 2 others suffered severe, permanent eye damage\nafter being given shots of stem cells, extracted from fat, into their\neyes. The warning letter accused the company of impairing the FDA's\nability to conduct its inspection by refusing to allow inspectors in,\nand denying them access to employees. It also said that US Stem Cell\nhad failed to establish proper quality control and sanitary\nstandards. The entire article related to FDA issues with stem cell clinics can\nbe found at the source URL above. - Mod.LL Byline: Sheila Kaplan, Denise Grady \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) Clearly scientifically inappropriate use of stem cells by\n\"unscrupulous\" clinics is occurring as discussed in the article above.\nThe posting of this on ProMED was precipitated by the report of the\nsmallpox vaccine, referred to as vaccinia, administered with stem\ncells by injecting directly into a tumor. The current vaccine\n\"ACAM2000\" is the same virus as the former \"Dryvax\" except that the\nvirus is grown in tissue culture rather than from inoculation of\ncalves. The only approved indication for the vaccine is to protect\nindividuals who are working with variations of the vaccinia vaccine in\nlaboratories and for military personnel or others who theoretically\ncould be exposed to smallpox as a biowarfare event. I recently immunized several dozen laboratory workers with ACAM2000\nrelated to work they will be doing with a recombinant vaccinia virus\nin an animal model. In order to obtain the vaccine, we had to fill out\na request form with a list of individuals to be immunized. As a\nreminder, the technique for immunization is \"scarification\" where a\nsmall amount of the reconstituted virus is introduced into the skin\nusing a bifurcated needle\n((https://jetinfectors.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/bifurcated-needle-1.jpg?w=401&h=261)).\nThe primary \"take\" is a vesicle/pustule developing about 7 days later\n(shown at\n(http://health.mo.gov/emergencies/ert/pdf/SmallpoxVaccinationReactions.pdf)).\nOne contraindication for use is in immunocompromised hosts (including\nsome patients with cancer) and the virus is never inoculated by other\ntechniques. More information about vaccination can be obtained from\nthe CDC at (https://www.cdc.gov/smallpox/vaccine-basics/index.html). Currently in press in Lancet Infectious Diseases, Clarissa Damaso from\nInstituto de Biofísica Carlos Chagas Filho, Universidade Federal do\nRio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil has written an excellent review\non the history of smallpox vaccines: Damaso CR: Revisiting Jenner's mysteries, the role of the Beaugency\nlymph in the evolutionary path of ancient smallpox vaccines. Lancet\nInfect Dis. 2017. pii: S1473-3099(17)30445-0. doi:\n10.1016/S1473-3099(17)30445-0; full text, references, and figures\navailable at\n(http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/laninf/PIIS1473-3099(17)30445-0.pdf): \"The origins of Jenner's vaccine have been intensively debated over\nthe years. British researcher Downie studied the close immunological\nrelationship of variola, cowpox, and vaccinia viruses, which led him\nto propose in 1951 that vaccinia virus had emerged from cowpox virus\nin the early years of vaccination (26). In 1965, Downie strongly\nopposed Peter Razzell's proposal that vaccinia virus had derived from\nan attenuated form of variola virus (27-29). Derrick Baxby (1940-2017)\nalso refuted Razzell's belief and proposed in 1981 that modern 20th\ncentury vaccines had derived from horsepox virus (30-32). In fact, we\ncurrently know that vaccinia virus is more closely related to horsepox\nvirus than to cowpox virus. On the basis of full-genome analysis and\nrecent phylogenetic inferences, horsepox virus is considered an\nancestor of the vaccinia lineage (33-36). Because all modern smallpox\nvaccine strains consist of vaccinia virus, one would expect that\nhorsepox virus, or even vaccinia virus, would be better candidates\nthan cowpox virus for the original source of Jenner's vaccine.\nAlthough an attractive hypothesis, the obscure history of cowpox,\nhorsepox, and vaccinia viruses further adds to the mystery. Since the\nmid-20th century, cows have been rarely found sick because of\ninfection by cowpox virus, and only felines, pet rodents, and zoo\nanimals, primarily in Europe, have been affected by the virus in the\npast decades (37-40). As for horsepox, the disease is rare and some\nbelieve it is extinct, at least in Europe (23,24,31,32,41). Only one\nexisting strain of horsepox virus obtained from Mongolian horses in\n1976 is currently known (33). However, vaccinia virus has never been\nfound naturally occurring in animals, except in India, where the\nstrain buffalopox infects buffaloes, and in Brazil, where the strain\nCantagalo (Cantagalo virus) infects dairy cows (2,42-44). In any case,\nall 3 orthopoxviruses cause zoonotic infections, and individuals\nacquire the infection when handling infected animals figures 2 and 3\n(2,22,37,40,45,46)\" \"The history and evolutionary relationships of the different smallpox\nvaccine strains remain obscure, because most strains and clonal\nvariants have not yet been completely sequenced. Historical and\nscientific evidence suggests that the Beaugency lymph lymph passed in\ncows by Chambon and Lanoix and, in October, 1866, they mixed this\nmaterial with lymph obtained from a 2nd natural case of cowpox\ndiscovered in Saint-Mandé, in the suburbs of Paris. The mixture was\nreferred to as the Beaugency lymph and was used subsequently by the\nAnimal Vaccine Institute as a seed to produce the vaccine\n(20,48,72,74) and horsepox virus made a strong contribution to the\ngenetic makeup of the existing vaccine strains, particularly those\nfrom continental Europe, USA, and Brazil. Evidence also suggests that\nthe Beaugency lymph was probably a vaccinia virus strain or a close\nancestor related to horsepox virus, and not a cowpox strain. Thus, it\nis reasonable to believe not only that cowpox virus was not used as a\nsmallpox vaccine in the 19th century, but that it might have never\nbeen used at all. Assumptions about the origins of the Beaugency lymph\nalso indicate that vaccinia virus was once a circulating virus in\nanimals in Europe in the 19th century, but later it disappeared and\nnow has no natural hosts, except in Brazil, India, and perhaps in\nEgypt, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal. Many questions still persist,\nand analysis of full-genome sequences of ancient vaccine strains would\nhelp unravel this fascinating medical mystery.\" - Mod.LL A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at:\n(http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106).

The health department will take help from experts at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and US-based agency Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to check the spread of Japanese encephalitis in Gorakhpur region.  In April 2017, the department had launched an intensive vaccination drive in 20 districts prone to Japanese encephalitis (JE) and acute encephalitis syndrome (AES).  About 93 lakh 9 300 000 children were vaccinated before the onset of monsoon. Though the number of JE patients came down, AES cases continued to grow. See Japanese encephalitis & other - India (18): comment http://promedmail.org/post/20170830.5283261 where the decline in JE and the increase of AES is described and graphed. - Mod.TY  Talking to HT, secretary (health and family welfare) V Hekali Zhimomi said, \"The clinical and laboratory test of the samples of patients' serum attributed 50 percent of AES cases to scrub typhus, Coxsackie virus, enterovirus (polio entrovirus, echo virus), malaria, herpes, meningoencephalitis, tuberculous encephalitis while the remaining 50 percent of the pathogens remained unknown.\"  The initial study attributed scrub typhus to mites and unhygienic conditions.  A team of experts from ICMR visited BRD Medical College and government hospitals after the death of the 30 children on 10 - 11 Aug 2017 to take stock of ground reality.  Later, the team led by ICMR director-general Soumya Swaminathan met chief minister Yogi Adityanath to discuss the measures required to strengthen health facilities.  During the meeting, the health department officers drew the attention of ICMR scientists towards unidentified pathogens that were infecting children in Gorakhpur and adjoining districts.  \"The ICMR officers assured assistance and recommended better health services in rural areas and mobilising human resource at government hospitals,\" Zhimomi said.  She said since quacks and healers active in rural areas were the 1st contact person for patients, the health department was planning to involve them in fighting the menace.  Quacks, popular as 'jhola chhap doctor' in east UP, will be given training to guide suspected AES patients.  Auxiliary nursing midwives (ANM), accredited social health activists (ASHA) and anganbari workers in villages are being trained to create awareness among the people aganbaris are a type of rural mother and child care center in India.  The department has also decided to deploy health education officers in awareness programme.  The focus will be on early admission of patients at nearby primary health centres (PHCs) and community health centres (CHCs). The officers will also create awareness among villagers through information-education-communication (IEC) regarding preventive measures, symptom of the disease and early examination by medical practitioners.  \"The department has identified 676 high-risk villages in Gorakhpur region where maximum cases of JE/AES have been reported. The district magistrates have been directed to launch sanitation drive in villages, organise awareness campaigns and carry out fogging to eliminate mosquitoes and mites which are the carriers of the virus Japanese encephalitis is a mosquito-transmitted virus, scrub typhus is a mite-transmitted rickettsial bacterium. - Mod.TY,\" she said.  Services of Christian Medical College (CMC) Vellore and PATH Foundation will be taken to train government doctors managing critical care units at the hospital.  The health department is also working to build confidence of government doctors at PHCs and CHCs.  It was found during the study that instead of handling patients, the doctors at health centres referred them to BRD Medical College. The aim is to reduce the burden of medical college which receives huge number of patients from Bihar and Nepal as well. The state government is improving facilities at district hospitals and CHCs.  \"The doctors have been asked to admit JE/AES patients to the hospital rather than referring them to medical college,\" she said.  Talking to HT, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said the state government had decided to seek the assistance of private doctors and members of the Indian Medical Association to check AES.  The unit of National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, located in Gorakhpur, will be strengthened to conduct research work.  Byline: Rajesh Kumar Singh   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  The determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_), and lychee fruit consumption. Recently, scrub typhus has been implicated in many AES cases. With the likelihood of multiple etiologies, a long-term and well integrated study will be required to determine the causes of AES. The plans mentioned above will expand and intensify surveillance. Laboratory support will be increased and a broad range or expertise will be added. The patient load in the BRD medical college will be reduced and the capability of district hospital and community health centers for patient treatment will be improved. One hopes that these integrated efforts will last long enough to provide an accurate diagnosis of what is causing AES and lead to some initiatives to better treat or to prevent cases.

The\nfollowing is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In:\nChronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract.\nGreydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in\npress): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons,\nvaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside\nof Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as\n60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection\nlengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:\n- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam;\n- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however,\nhave suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be\neffective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and\noutbreak situations (63, 64). \"References\n\n57.

In Central America and the Caribbean, influenza activity continued to be reported in a few countries. Influenza activity remained at low levels in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere. Worldwide, influenza A(H3N2) viruses are predominating.  In temperate South America, respiratory illness indicators and influenza activity decreased in most of the sub-region, with influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominating.  In Southern Africa, influenza activity appeared to have plateaued in South Africa, with influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominantly detected.  In Oceania, seasonal influenza activity continued to increase, with influenza A(H3N2) and B viruses present in the region.  In tropical South America, influenza and other respiratory virus activity remained low.  In the Caribbean and Central American countries, respiratory illness indicators and influenza activity remained low in general, but respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) activity was increasing.  In Southern Asia, increased influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus detections were reported in India. Severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and influenza like illness (ILI) indicators remained high in Bhutan.  In South East Asia, increased influenza activity was reported in recent weeks, with all seasonal influenza subtypes present in the region.  In East and Western Asia, influenza activity remained low in general.  In Western Africa, influenza activity continued to be reported, with all seasonal influenza subtypes present in the region. Few influenza detections were reported in Eastern Africa.  In Northern Africa, no influenza virus detections were reported.  In Central Asia, there were no updated reports on virus detections or respiratory illness indicators.  In Europe and North America, little to no influenza activity was reported.  National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 64 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the period from 7-20 Aug 2017 (data as of 2017-09-01 04:28:36 UTC). The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 48522 specimens during that period. 7438 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 6637 (89.2 percent) were typed as influenza A and 801 (10.8 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 746 (14 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and 4586 (86 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 99 (53.8 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 85 (46.2 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail.

Another finding of concern is that DEN-4 strain,\nresembling the one detected in Pune in 2009, was detected in as many\nas 11 samples. DEN-4 is associated with unusual symptoms like\nrespiratory distress, pleural effusion, and elevated levels of liver\nenzymes.

This came about after 2\nkidney recipients in Taiwan were diagnosed with dengue 2 days after\nreceiving a kidney each from the same donor, said National Cheng Kung\nUniversity microbiology and immunology professor Dr Oscar Perng\nGuey-chuen. \"This indicates a potential risk,\" the Taiwan-based\nscientist said, adding that no dengue virus was detected in the\ndonor's blood. He said the donor contracted dengue in 2015 and in mid-2016, he died\nin an accident. His family donated his corneas, liver, heart, and\nkidneys. Both patients had the same strain of the dengue virus the\ndonor had in 2015 and one of the recipients died of dengue\nhaemorrhagic fever, he said. Asked where the virus could be hiding since it could not be detected\nin the blood, he said it was a question scientists are trying to\nanswer. Interestingly, those who received the donor's corneas, liver,\nand heart did not develop dengue, Dr Perng said on the sidelines of\nthe National Dengue And Arboviruses Infection Conference 2017\nyesterday 12 Aug 2017. He said although there was not enough\nevidence to show the virus came from the donor as the kidneys were not\ntested for dengue before the transplant, the same virus was found in\nthe patients' bodies after that. Dr Perng said his team had studied mice for dengue virus in the blood\ntestes, kidney, liver, spleen and brain, and found the virus present\nin the kidneys and brain. \"We believe the virus probably resided in\nthe kidneys and was not cleared by the body,\" he said, adding that the\nvirus could have been activated after transplant. He said this raised\nconcerns about asymptomatic people who are dengue carriers. Health Ministry deputy director, general Datuk Dr S Jeyaindran said\npatients with severe dengue would have better recovery if they were\ngiven colloids, a more concentrated fluid, at the early stage in fluid\nmanagement for dengue patients. Dr Jeyaindran, who was representing\nHealth Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam, said colloids may be\nintroduced at an earlier stage, instead of saline because it has not\nbeen successful in treating patients with severe dengue.

The spread of dengue to new areas is\nlikely due in large part to trends in air travel, researchers now\nreport in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Dengue virus affects as estimated 390 million people around the globe\neach year, and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild fever and\nheadache to severe low blood pressure. The virus has mostly caused\ndisease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, but a 2014\noutbreak in Japan broke that pattern. Overall, the geographic area\naffected by dengue has been growing in recent years. In the new work, Huaiyu Tian and Bing Xu, both of Beijing Normal\nUniversity, China, together with colleagues from the University of\nOxford and elsewhere analyzed the spread of dengue viruses in Asia\nfrom 1956 to 2015. They used 2202 genetic sequences of dengue viruses,\ncollected in 20 countries or regions of Asia over the 59 years, to\ndetermine how different strains were related. They also investigated\ntrends in air travel, maritime mobility, migration, and\nsocio-economics to determine what factors impact the spread of\ndengue. The spread of 3 different dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1, -2, and -3,\nis associated with air traffic more so than any other factors, the\ndata revealed. Air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India, the\nresearchers found, help seed dengue epidemics, while China, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, and Singapore help diffuse the virus to other Asian\ncountries. \"Future trends in global mobility could potentially accelerate the\nappearance and diffusion of DENV worldwide,\" the researchers say.\n\"Prevention and control of dengue epidemics requires a better\nunderstanding of its mode of geographic dissemination, especially for\ncountries in the tropics.\" Reference: Tian H, Sun Z, Faria NR, et al.

Date: Thu 31 Aug 2017. From: Michael J. Bangs (mbangs@fmi.com) (edited)   It stands to reason that the presence of _Anopheles farauti_ as the new entrant into New Caledonia is presumably recent. The nearest neighbor is Vanuatu, a malaria-endemic country that has but one anopheline species present in that island group, _Anopheles farauti_ sensu stricto, an effective malaria vector provided you add _Plasmodium_ to the mix.  _Anopheles farauti_ is one member of 8 known sibling species in the _Farauti_ Complex (closely related species that are morphologically identical, thus confounding accurate identification without the use of molecular techniques). It is by far the most widely distributed species in the complex in the southwest Pacific region (Maluku island group, eastern Indonesia to northern Australia, PNG, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu). The species' ability to inhabit brackish water environments (predominantly a coastal inhabitant) has aided in its dispersal throughout the region.  The origin of the anopheline population in New Caledonia might remain a mystery, but this discovery is of concern. If the area of establishment is relatively confined, it might be possible to eliminate this species before it extends further into the country. Foremost, identify the species.   Michael J.

Source: Pajhwok Afghan News (edited) (https://www.pajhwok.com/en/2017/08/28/congo-virus-kills-13-infects-42-herat)   Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has killed 13 people in western Herat province this year 2017, with another 42 being treated for the deadly virus, according to officials.  CCHF is a viral disease. Symptoms may include fever, muscle pains, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding into the skin. The CCHF virus is typically spread by tick bites or contact with livestock carrying the disease.  Health officials in Herat advised people to be careful these days due to increased interaction with livestock in the wake of Eidul Adha Sacrifice Feast; 31 Aug-4 Sep 2017, when Muslims across the globe slaughter millions of animals.  Public health director in Herat Abdul Hakim Tamana said many people lost their lives to the Congo virus in the province this year 2017. He said 55 Congo cases were registered in the civil hospital since late March and of the patients, 13 had died. The deceased included 7 men and 6 women, he added.  Tamana said the virus spread from animals and people slaughtering animals should wear gloves.  A livestock farmer, who has contracted Congo virus, said: \"When I slaughtered the sheep, its blood covered my hands and later I started falling sick.\"  Ahmad Khalil Waez, animal healthcare director, said citizens should be careful while slaughtering animals to avoid contracting the Congo virus. He said a butcher should used special glasses, coat, gloves, mask, and shoes while slaughtering the animal.  People mainly contract the CCHF virus from infected ticks or contact with infected animal blood and tissue.  There are no vaccines available to immunize animals but precautionary measures include disinfection of livestock pens, submerging livestock in solutions for decontamination, and meat packaging safeguards.  The virus has had a presence in neighbouring Iran where the virus killed 3 people in 2015.  According to the World Health Organization, CCHF's mortality rate is about 30 percent and is endemic to Africa, the Balkans and Ukraine, the Middle East, and Central Asia.  CCHF was first detected in the Crimea in 1944 and then in the Congo in 1969. In 2011, it was detected for the first time in ticks in Spain.

(promed@promedmail.org)  In 2008, a major outbreak was reported in Herat City, western Afghanistan, with approximately 60 suspected and 6 confirmed cases. Later, a cross-sectional seroprevalence survey was conducted among livestock-owning households in the same districts of Herat City where the outbreak had occurred, which showed that IgG seroprevalence was 11.2 and 75.0 percent in humans (n = 330) and livestock (n = 132), respectively ((https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3310665/)).  In 2016, 66 cases had been reported by 7 Sep, with 12 deaths ((http://www.emro.who.int/afg/afghanistan-news/cchf-eid.html)). CCHF virus has been observed in over 30 countries, including in Africa (Democratic Republic of Congo, South Africa, Nigeria, Senegal, Uganda, Tanzania, Mauritania, Kenya), Asia (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, China), the Middle East (Iran, Iraq, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman), and southeastern Europe (the Russian Federation, Bulgaria, Albania, Kosovo, Turkey, Greece, and Spain) ((https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23458713)).  People most at risk of contracting CCHF include animal herders, livestock workers, butchers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Healthcare workers are also at risk of infection through unprotected contact with infectious blood and body fluids while caring for patients. There is no vaccine available for either people or animals, which means prevention is crucial. - Mod.UBA  Maps of Afghanistan can be seen at (http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/afghanistan_admin-2009.jpg) and (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1757). - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ  ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Iraq":{},"Ireland":{"114":{"title":"Measles update (43): Asia and Pacific, Europe, demographics\r\n\t","date":["26","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Measles update (43): Asia and Pacific, Europe, demographics\r\n\t[EXTERNAL]","summary":" A ProMED-mail post (http://www.promedmail.org) ProMED-mail is a program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases (http://www.isid.org)  In this update: Asia and Pacific  <br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Japan: travel alert <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Australia (Perth, Western Australia): ex Italy  Europe  <br><br><strong>{3}</strong> Germany (Berlin): 2014-15 <br><br><strong>{4}</strong> Romania  Measles immunity gaps  <br><br><strong>{5}</strong> Role of demographics   Asia and Pacific  <br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Japan: travel alert.

The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare is advising tourists to go to hospital if they develop a high fever or generalized rash after returning to Japan.  Although the World Health Organization verified that Japan has eliminated infections of endemic measles strains in 2015, group infections originating from people who contracted the disease abroad are spreading in the country. As of 6 Aug 2017, the number of patients reached 169 this year in Japan, already eclipsing the figure in the previous year.  About 4100 patients in Italy and around 6500 patients in Romania have already been confirmed as of August 2017 compared with about 860 and 2000, respectively, throughout 2016, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.  Symptoms of the highly contagious disease include runny nose, red and watery eyes, high fever, and rash. The virus is spread through coughing and sneezing and can cause complications such as pneumonia and can even result in death in one in 1000 patients, according to the ministry. The ministry recommends people traveling overseas to check their vaccination records and take an additional shot if they have only been vaccinated once.  The disease was prevalent about a decade ago in Japan with the number of patients soaring to over 10 000 in 2008 but the country was later considered as free from infections of the virus.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Japan can be found at (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/156). - Mod.LK   <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Australia (Perth, Western Australia): ex Italy.

Large measles outbreak introduced by asylum seekers and spread among the insufficiently vaccinated resident population, Berlin, October 2014 to August 2015. Euro Surveill. 2017; 22(34): pii=30599 - Abstract  The largest measles outbreak in Berlin since 2001 occurred from October 2014 to August 2015. Overall, 1344 cases were ascertained, 86 per cent (with available information) unvaccinated, including 146 (12 per cent) asylum seekers. Median age was 17 years (interquartile range: 4-29 years), 26 per cent were hospitalised and a 1 year old child died. Measles virus genotyping uniformly revealed the variant 'D8-Rostov-Don' and descendants. The virus was likely introduced by and initially spread among asylum seekers before affecting Berlin's resident population. Among Berlin residents, the highest incidence was in children younger than 2 years, yet most cases (52 per cent) were adults. Post-exposure vaccinations in homes for asylum seekers, not always conducted, occurred later (median: 7.5 days) than the recommended 72 hours after onset of the 1st case and reached only half of potential contacts. Asylum seekers should not only have non-discriminatory, equitable access to vaccination, they also need to be offered measles vaccination in a timely fashion, that is, immediately upon arrival in the receiving country. Supplementary immunisation activities targeting the resident population, particularly adults, are urgently needed in Berlin.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail.

A 10 month old girl, who was a refugee from Iraq, became the 33rd person to die of the infection, reports local Digi24. The girl arrived in Romania on 7 Jul 2017 with her family, and the doctors diagnosed her with measles in August. They also discovered that the child was suffering from malnutrition and severe psychomotor retardation.  The measles outbreak is still a major problem in Romania, with more than 8900 cases reported across the country until 25 Aug 2017, including 33 deaths, according to data from the National Center for Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases (CNSCBT). Most deaths were registered in Timis (9), Dolj (7), and Arad (6) counties.  Measles is a highly contagious respiratory infection caused by a virus. It causes a total-body skin rash and flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough, and runny nose. According to information posted on WHO's website, the virus is highly contagious, spreading by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact, and direct contact with infected nasal or throat secretions. Unvaccinated young children pose the highest risk of measles and its complications, including death.  The Romanian Government adopted earlier this month August 2017 a draft bill on the organization and financing of population vaccination (https://www.romania-insider.com/romania-draft-bill-vaccination/). The project was sent to the Parliament for approval and could come into force in January 2018.  byline: Irina Marica   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Measles tends to be more severe in children who are malnourished, especially children who are also vitamin A deficient. And complications are commoner and more serious in malnourished children. Because of complications such as diarrhoea, measles may lead to failure to thrive. Infection with measles virus may lead to kwashiorkor or marasmus in children who are underweight at the time that they get infected. Therefore, measles may result in, or aggravate, malnutrition.

Date: Sat 26 Aug 2017. Source: News-Medical/Life Sciences (edited) (https://www.news-medical.net/news/20170826/New-study-highlights-role-played-by-demographics-in-the-spread-of-measles.aspx)   Even if the incidence of measles infection has decreased by at least 90 per cent worldwide since the introduction of the vaccine, measles is still one of the major causes of death in children among vaccine-preventable diseases. Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world.  A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries.  Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years.  \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\"  \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea\".  The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years 2 million DALYs since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln 13 million DALYs in the US, and 36-mln 36 million DALYs in Ethiopia.  \"Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,\" continues Prof Melegaro \"our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population. Tailoring immunization campaigns to achieve measles eradication goals is essential and currently, for some countries, this means considering also the role of unprotected adolescents and young adults.\"   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Reference - Trentini F, Poletti P, Merler S, Melegaro A.

While it is recommended that children get 2 doses of MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine, starting with the 1st dose at 12 through 15 months of age, and the 2nd dose at 4 through 6 years of age, this study emphasizes that it is important that adolescents and young adults also are up to date on their MMR vaccination. - Mod.LK  ","keywordsMatched":[]},"148":{"title":"Hepatitis B - Ireland (02): post-transfusion, seronegative blood,\r\n\tcomment ","date":["30","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO> Hepatitis B - Ireland (02): post-transfusion, seronegative blood,\r\n\tcomment [EXTERNAL]","summary":" A ProMED-mail post (http://www.promedmail.org) ProMED-mail is a program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases (http://www.isid.org) . Date: Wed 30 Aug 2017. From: F. Blaine Hollinger MD (blaineh@bcm.edu)   1. There is also a seronegative window period that precedes the first detection of HBV DNA and prior to the appearance of HBsAg following acute infection. However, the level of virus may not be sufficient to cause HBV based on the HBV genotype (Hsia et al, 2006).  2. Is minipool NAT or ID NAT being done for HBV DNA detection by blood banks in Ireland? And if minipool NAT, how many samples were in the minipool since this could compromise sensitivity?  3. Was the archived donor specimen also tested for total anti-HBc, a test done in US blood facilities, but not in Ireland?  4. What is the evidence that the recipient was not previously infected with HBV, while bearing in mind that patients with chronic hepatitis B may be positive for IgM anti-HBc during acute reactivation of their disease. And if the recipient was IgM positive, what was the ratio of the anti-HBc test result based on the cutoff value and the patient's value?  5. Fortunately, the outcome is usually favorable with limited risk of chronicity in immunocompetent patients who acquire acute hepatitis B.   F. Blaine Hollinger, M.D. Professor of Medicine, Molecular Virology & Epidemiology Director, Eugene B. Casey Hepatitis Research Center Baylor College of Medicine Houston, TX (blaineh@bcm.edu)  It is always an honor to receive comments from Dr. Hollinger, a long time leader in viral hepatitis research.  Regarding his questions/comments:  1. As I noted in the moderation of the original post, there is a lesser discussed \"window period\" occurring in the incubation period of acute hepatitis B prior to the development of HBsAg and before the development of anti-HBc (IgM and then IgG). The more classical \"window period\" occurs towards the end of acute hepatitis B, whether clinically overt or not, when HBsAg is not longer detectable by standard assays but before anti-HBs is detectable. The only serologic evidence of HBV is anti-HBc and IgM anti-HBc should be positive. HBV DNA is also detectable. It has been shown that blood transfused during this period can be infectious for HBV.  2-4. All good questions which I cannot supply answers to.  5. Most patients who are not immunosuppressed will clear HBV within 3-6 months. 10 percent will not although half of these are usually clear within a year. No information regarding the patient in this case was supplied. - Mod.LL  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/39).

Date: Thu 31 Aug 2017. From: Niamh O'Flaherty (Niamh.O'Flaherty@ibts.ie)   IBTS response to ProMED: Hepatitis B - Ireland - Thank you for giving the opportunity for The Irish Blood Transfusion Service (IBTS) to respond to your recent article and subsequent comments related to the first known case of HBV transmission through blood transfusion in Ireland.  The IBTS employ individual donation nucleic acid testing (ID- NAT) to screen every blood donation for blood-borne viruses (BBV) including HBV, using the Ultrio-Elite (UE) multiplex assay manufactured by Grifols/Hologic. Both the manufacturer and the IBTS have confirmed the assay has a limit of detection for HBV of the order of 4 IU/mL. In addition, in terms of screening for HBV markers we test for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen.  For clarification purposes, the transmission of HBV in this case was due to a donation obtained in the pre-ID NAT window period, when the level of HBV DNA in the donor's blood was below the limit of detection of even this extremely sensitive assay. The window period for the UE assay is of the order of just 15 days. The IBTS introduced ID NAT testing in 2009, in order to avail of this shorter window period and hence earliest possible detection of HBV infection. As mentioned in your comments, the serological window period is significantly longer.  A full investigation has been conducted into this case. During this investigation it was demonstrated that the assay performed within the expected level of sensitivity. In addition, the investigation demonstrated that all aspects of laboratory testing and donor screening were satisfactory. The IBTS will continue to employ the most advanced technologies and safest screening strategy available to maintain the safety of the blood supplied to the people of Ireland.   Dr. Niamh O'Flaherty Consultant Microbiologist Irish Blood Transfusion Service (Niamh.O'Flaherty@ibts.ie)  ProMED thanks Dr. O'Flaherty for the quick response. It seems that the \"serological window period\" when HBsAg disappears and anti-HBs has not appeared yet is not the issue here but rather the blood was transfused prior to the HBsAg becoming positive and anti-HBc has yet to be positive. Anti-HBc would be positive in the \"serological window\".  Although the Irish press has been somewhat reactive regarding this quite rare episode, clearly the Irish Blood Transfusion Service is not at fault at all here. - Mod.LL  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/39).

Among these cases there were 32 deaths, as follows: 8 in\nTimis County, 6 in Arad, 7 in Dolj, 3 in Caras-Severin, and one in\neach Bihor, Cluj, Calarasi, Satu Mare, Vaslui, Galati, Mures, and\nBucharest. Measles outbreaks have been registered in all 41 counties,\nthe most affected  with over 1000 cases each  being Timis (1215\ncases), Caras-Severin (1110), and Arad (1002). The measles outbreak in Romania in 2016 is not circumstantial, but a\ndirect consequence of the \"major\" malfunctions in public policy\nregarding vaccination, minister of health Florian Bodog stated on Fri\n11 Aug in a press release. \"For years now Romania has been below the\nsafety threshold of vaccination coverage. That is, the risk of a\nmeasles outbreak was imminent. Which is what actually happened. The\noutbreak of the measles epidemic in 2016 is not conjectural, it is a\ndirect consequence of major malfunctions in the public policy on\nvaccination,\" the minister of health stated. According to him, the Vaccination Law corrects the irregularities that\nled to the epidemic, providing the best conditions for protecting\nchildren's health. \"For Romania, the stake of the vaccination bill is\nhuge. Ensuring a healthy future for 4 million children lies in our\nhands. The Romanian parliament, the highest institution of democracy,\nwill decide on the final content of this law. However, beyond the\ndebates in parliament, it is important that all the public opinion be\ninformed and understand the true meaning of the law and the profound\nchanges it brings. (..) We have a moral duty towards our children, to\nprevent harm before it happens. As we also have a moral duty to the\ncommunity in which we live to prevent harm before it happens to other\nchildren or parents,\" Bodog said, quoted in the press release. He added that any bill is amendable and that is why it is open to any\npublic debates as long as they are carried out with honesty, good\nsense and decency. \"But this project is the day-to-day work of\nspecialists in the field of vaccination and who have faced all the\nflaws of the current framework. That is why the law has been carefully\nand correctly thought through by those who best understand how to\nregulate the vaccination policy,\" the minister of health also said. The bill on the organisation and funding of public vaccination in\nRomania was adopted by the government on Wed 9 Aug 2017. The bill\nwas submitted to parliament for debate and adoption. The normative act\nwould come into force on 1 Jan 2018. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) A similar report can be found in El Pais (12 Aug 2017) which states\nin addition that, of the 95 per cent vaccine coverage recommended by\nthe World Health Organization (WHO), 86 per cent have been\nvaccinated since 2007, according to its national epidemiological\ncentre. \"Highly worrying\" figures, acknowledged the prime minister,\nMihai Tudose, this week. \"More than 180 000 children in our country,\nfrom 9 months to 9 years, are not immunized against measles. In some\nregions, the rate of immunization of the 2nd dose does not reach 50\nper cent; and this is very serious.\" Timis and Caras-Severin, Arad\n(all to the west of the country, near the border with Serbia or\nHungary), are the most affected, with more than 1000 measles cases\neach, reported in the last 10 months when the outbreak was declared.

The index case had just returned from visiting family in the Ukraine\nwhere he likely contracted the disease. When he returned to Israel he\nvisited a clinic where he infected 8 other soldiers who were waiting\nin line to see a physician. \"The IDF, together with the Health\nMinistry, carried out an investigation to locate the cases and\nidentify the source of the infection,\" the army said in a statement,\nadding that all those who had contact with the soldiers had been\ngiven preventative treatment. An IDF spokesman told The Jerusalem Post\nthat the soldier who contracted the disease had 2 stopovers in Europe\non his way back to Israel from the Ukraine but was not able to specify\nwhich countries. WHO in March 2017 warned of a measles outbreak sweeping across\nEurope in places where immunization rates have plummeted. The figures\ncover the agency's entire European region  53 countries including\nIsrael, Kazakhstan, and Russia. According to WHO 559 measles cases\nwere reported in Europe between January and March 2017. While the\nlargest current measles outbreaks in Europe were reported in Romania\nand Italy, other countries reporting cases were France, Germany,\nPoland, Switzerland, and the Ukraine. \"With steady progress toward\nelimination over the past 2 years, it is of particular concern that\nmeasles cases are climbing in Europe,\" said Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO\nregional director for Europe. \"Today's travel patterns put no person\nor country beyond the reach of the measles virus. Outbreaks will\ncontinue in Europe, as elsewhere, until every country reaches the\nlevel of immunization needed to fully protect their populations.\" Israeli children are routinely immunized with the MMR measles, mumps,\nrubella vaccine which are given in 2 doses, at 1 year and a booster\nin the 1st grade. The Health Ministry has stated that the level of\nvaccine coverage in Israel is among the highest in the West, with 97\nper cent coverage for 1st and 2nd doses MMR and chickenpox vaccine. While no vaccine is 100 per cent effective, an infectious disease\nspecialist told the Post that measles is \"a nasty illness\" that is\npreventable by proper immunization. But while it is highly recommended\nby medical professionals and the Health Ministry, the vaccine is not\nmandatory and according to the IDF the measles vaccine is not part of\nthe vaccines given to new recruits. \"We cannot afford to have soldiers\nwho are severely ill with a highly contagious disease. It would be\nappropriate for the IDF to verify and update immunizations of all\npersonnel and new recruits,\" the infectious disease specialist told\nthe Post. Measles is spread by coughing and sneezing and close contact with\ninfected individuals. While most infected people usually experience\nonly mild symptoms it is one of the leading causes of death among\nyoung children globally. Measles takes about 8-12 days following\ncontact before the individual will show symptoms which include a\nfever, bad cough, red eyes, and a runny nose. A few days after the\nrespiratory symptoms, the infected individual will get a bad rash.\nOther complications of measles include gastroenteritis (diarrhea and\nvomiting), pneumonia, severe bleeding problems, and in some rare cases\nencephalitis (brain infections). In June 2017, 5 cases of measles were reported to the Health\nMinistry  all of them women between the ages of 20-40 who lived in\nJerusalem. byline: Anna Ahronheim \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) Even with 97 per cent vaccine coverage, measles virus can cause small\noutbreaks.

Measles is an airborne disease that affects mostly children between\nthe ages of 6 months and 10 years, although it can also affect\nadults. Although Prof Mbonye said there was no cause for alarm, he urged the\npublic to be vigilant and report any suspected cases to the nearest\nhealth facilities. The public has also been urged to look out for\ncommon early symptoms associated with the disease, which include high\nfever, cough, red swelling eyelids and muscle and body irritability. According to the Ministry of Health, an estimated 20 per cent of\npeople who get infected with measles often develop complications,\nwhich if not managed early enough can lead to death. Despite previous\nmass vaccination campaigns, Uganda has had several outbreaks of the\ndisease. Prof Mbonye blamed it on parents who do not take their\nchildren for immunisation at the right time. Current national\nimmunisation coverage stands at 85 per cent. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) According to WHO, in 2016 global vaccination coverage (all vaccines)\nwas stalled at 86 per cent, with no significant changes during the\npast year. For measles alone, by the end of 2016, 85 per cent of\nchildren had received 1 dose of vaccine by their 2nd birthday, and 164\ncountries had included a 2nd dose as part of routine immunization; 64\nper cent of children received 2 doses of measles vaccine according to\nnational immunization schedules. It is generally thought that because\nmeasles is such a highly transmissible disease, that 90-95 per cent of\npeople must be vaccinated in order to protect the entire population,\nor achieve herd immunity.

This is the 1st detection of KHVD in BC by the CFIA, but the disease has been previously detected in Manitoba and Ontario.  The disease detection was associated with an import of koi from Israel by a wholesaler who distributed fish to greenhouses, pet stores and garden centres within BC for sale to private individuals. As a result of this detection, the import of all susceptible species of aquatic animals from Israel for the following end uses will be suspended until further notice:  - aquarium - commercial; - aquarium - private; - outdoor holding unit - commercial; and - outdoor holding unit - private.  The CFIA is committed to working with Israel to ensure that Canada's aquatic animal health import requirements are met and the suspended zoosanitary export certificate, which applies to all exports from Israel for the aforementioned end uses, can be renegotiated as quickly as possible in order to minimize any impact on trade.  KHVD poses no risk to human health or food safety; however, this virus can infect other susceptible species and is reportable under Canada's Reportable Diseases Regulations.

A young Italian adult was diagnosed with measles in Finland in June\n2017. During the stay in Finland and subsequent travel to Estonia, the\ncase exposed altogether several hundred persons to measles. As of Fri\n11 Aug 2017, 5 secondary cases of measles have been detected. As the\ninvestigation is still ongoing, we present here the preliminary\nfindings and implemented control measures regarding this cluster of\nmeasles. Description of the cluster\n\nIndex Case 1 was a young Italian adult who arrived in Finland on Sun\n11 Jun 2017 and attended an international camp in Finland from 12 to\n25 Jun 2017 (Figure 1 for Figures/Tables, see original URL -\nMod.LL). After developing fever and respiratory symptoms on Fri 16 Jun 2017\nand rash on Wed 21 Jun 2017, Case 1 was admitted to the hospital of\nCity A and was isolated and monitored because enterovirus infection or\nmeasles was suspected. Serum and throat specimens were taken on Thu\n22 Jun 2017. While the confirmatory laboratory results were still\npending, the case was discharged and returned to the camp premises on\nSat 24 Jun 2017. On Sun 25 Jun 2017, Case 1 traveled to Helsinki\nby train (without a designated seat, 3.5 hours) and to Tallinn by\nferry (no cabin booked, 2.5 hours), staying one night before flying\nback to Italy. On Tue 27 Jun 2017, Case 1 was laboratory-confirmed\nfor measles infection. The case self-reported to be vaccinated with 2\ndoses of measles-containing vaccine; however, the laboratory results\ncontradicted this as the case tested negative for measles-specific IgG\nantibodies (Table). Subsequently, 5 secondary cases of measles were identified (Figures 1\nand 2). 4 of them were laboratory-confirmed (Cases 2, 4, 5 and 6).\nCase 3 was classified as a probable case (no laboratory testing\nbecause of parental objection). Cases 2 and 3 were adolescent siblings\nliving in City A. Both attended a summer camp organized at the same\npremises as the international camp. Both were placed in home\nisolation. Case 4 was a person working in a cafeteria in City B who\nhad visited the camp premises on Mon 19 Jun 2017. Cases 2, 3 and 4\nhad lunch in the same canteen used by other camp attendees including\nCase 1. Epidemiological investigations for Case 5 are still ongoing\nbut so far no link between other cases has been established. It is\npossible that there is an unknown case in the transmission chain. Case\n6 was a close contact of Case 5, identified during contact tracing.\nThe case had been vaccinated with 2 doses of the measles-mumps-rubella\n(MMR) vaccine in childhood; all other secondary cases were\nunvaccinated (Table). Laboratory findings\n-\nHealthcare providers were asked to send all clinical samples from\nsuspected measles cases to the measles reference laboratory of the\nFinnish National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL). Measles\nsequences available for 5 cases were identical and genotyped as D8\n(Table). Based on the Measles Nucleotide Surveillance database, this\nstrain was identical to strains isolated in Italy during 2017 and to a\nstrain identified in a British traveler, and it shared very high\nnucleotide similarity () 99.78 percent) with more than 600 sequences\ndetected on 5 continents between 2015 and 2017, indicating recent\nglobal spread of nearly identical measles viruses 1,2. 6 suspected\ncases were discarded after laboratory analysis. In addition, 3\npotentially exposed, asymptomatic people tested negative for measles. Conclusion\n\nIn Finland, a country with nationally high MMR vaccination coverage,\nextensive outbreaks of measles are unlikely to occur.

A large measles outbreak has been ongoing in Milan and surrounding\nareas, a densely populated area with nearly 4 million inhabitants.\nRapid and active surveillance was set up by the Subnational Reference\nLaboratories (SRL) Milan, established as part of the measles and\nrubella surveillance network MoRoNet <br><br><strong>{1}</strong> in March 2017, with 303\ninvestigated cases at the time of submission of this report. We\npresent a detailed analysis of the period 1 Mar 2017 to 30 Jun 2017,\nwith the aim to conduct a complete and rapid characterization of\nwild-type measles virus (MV) strains circulating. Confirmation and investigation of cases and clusters in Milan\n\nFrom 1 Mar to 30 Jun 2017, 233 suspected cases of measles were\ninvestigated: there were 203 (87 percent) laboratory-confirmed cases\n(median age: 30 years; range: 2 months-77 years) and 30 (13 percent)\nwere discarded. Overall 60 percent (n = 121) of the confirmed\ncases were individuals aged 15-39 years and 6 percent (n = 12)\nwere ≤ 1 year of age; 88 percent (n = 179) were not\nvaccinated and 12 percent (n = 24) were vaccinated (6 with 2 doses\nof measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, 10 with one dose, and 8 did\nnot know the number of doses). According to the epidemiological\nregional database, 108 of 203 were sporadic cases and 95 were related\nto 47 clusters. Cases were classified as sporadic when an\nepidemiological link to other cases could not be established. Molecular surveillance for cases and clusters\n\nThe genotype of MV strains was successfully identified in 187 of 203\n(92 percent) of the confirmed cases by sequencing the highly variable\nregion of nucleoprotein (N) gene (N-450) <br><br><strong>{2}</strong>. Phylogenetic analysis\nrevealed that the MV strains belonged to genotypes D8 and B3. The most\ncommon genotype detected was genotype D8 (86 percent; 160/187 cases)\nwhich was related to 77 cases in 42 clusters and 83 sporadic cases.\nAll of the D8 cases and clusters were autochthonous or from unknown\nsource. In March 2017, the B3 genotype was detected in 5 imported cases: 2\nsporadic cases and 3 cases which subsequently caused 3 import-related\nclusters. From Apr 2017 to end of Jun 2017, a further 14 autochthonous\nsporadic cases and one cluster were reported. The geographical and\ntemporal distribution, respectively, of sporadic cases and clusters\nrelated to D8 and B3 genotypes are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2 for\nFigures, see original URL - Mod.LL. Measles virus genotype D8\n\nPhylogenetic analysis showed that all the D8 sequences (n = 160)\nfell into the Osaka lineage (MVi/Osaka.JPN/29.15; similarity range:\n99-100 percent). From March to May, D8 MV strains mainly caused\nclusters in work and family settings, which occurred principally in\nthe north-eastern area of Milan. During the week starting on Mon 27\nMar 2017, a serious family cluster affected 3 cases causing the death\nof one of them. The D8 MV strain was isolated from the biological\nsamples of one of these cases. In Jun 2017, the D8 Osaka variant spread through the city of Milan and\ncaused a nosocomial cluster in a hospital. Based on epidemiological\ndata, a link was established between 12 cases: 8 healthcare workers\n(HCWs), 3 patients and one visitor. Phylogenetic analysis showed that\nthe 9 sequences obtained were 100 percent identical. The match of\nepidemiological data and phylogenetic analysis highlighted a single\ntransmission chain for all cases (Figure 3). Measles virus genotype B3\n\nPhylogenetic analysis showed that all B3 sequences (n = 27) were\nidentical to the variant Dublin (MVs/Dublin.IRL/8.16; similarity: 100\npercent) which is circulating in European countries and responsible\nfor an ongoing epidemic in Romania <br><br><strong>{3}</strong>. The B3 Dublin variant was 1st\nintroduced in the east of Milan at the beginning of March 2017, and\nthere was an epidemiological link to the Roma community in France. By\nthe end of March 2017, this variant was detected in a sporadic case\nreturning from Piedmont (northern Italy). Subsequently, the same\nvariant was isolated in a cluster caused by an index case returning\nfrom the Apulia Region (southern Italy) and in a cluster that was\nimported from Romania. In April 2017, genotype B3 was identified in a\nsporadic case returning from the Lazio Region (central Italy). During May 2017 and June 2017, 12 autochthonous cases were notified in\nthe eastern and south-eastern suburbs of Milan. In June 2017, 3\nnosocomial clusters were identified in an emergency department.\nAlthough initially reported as unrelated clusters, the phylogenetic\nanalysis showed a single source of transmission (n = 7, 2 HCWs, 4\npatients, and one visitor) (Figure 3). Conclusions\n\nEliminating measles and rubella is a core goal of World Health\nOrganization European Region Member States. Effective surveillance is\nessential for eliminating measles and rubella and its verification\n<br><br><strong>{4}</strong>. Since the beginning of 2017 and up to Sun 6 Aug 2017, the\nItalian Ministry of Health has reported 4087 cases of measles and 3\ndeaths. Most cases occurred in Piedmont and Lombardy (northern Italy),\nTuscany, Lazio and Abruzzo (central Italy) and Sicily (southern\nItaly). Most were older than 15 years (median age: 27 years) and 89\npercent of the cases were not vaccinated. Overall, 42 percent of the\ncases were hospitalized and 277 cases were reported among HCWs <br><br><strong>{5}</strong>. Timely measles surveillance is critical to disease control.\nIdentifying and confirming suspected measles cases through\nsurveillance allows early detection of outbreaks and analysis of\nongoing transmission in order to mount more effective vaccination\nmeasures. MV genotyping can play an important role in tracking\ntransmission pathways during outbreak investigations <br><br><strong>{6}</strong>. From March to June 2017, the genotypes D8 and B3 co-circulated in\nMilan and surrounding areas. The most common genotype detected was\ngenotype D8, related to 83 sporadic cases and 42 clusters. The high\nsimilarity between the D8 MV strains, all belonging to the Osaka\nlineage, suggests a unique initiating transmission event. This is the\n1st evidence of the Osaka D8 variant in northern Italy, which seems to\nbe replacing the D8 variants that had been circulating in this area\nsince 2013 7,8. Moreover, our data show multiple imported cases of\nB3 MV strains which subsequently spread across Italy and caused\nseveral autochthonous cases and clusters. The B3 Dublin variant has\nreplaced the B3 variant Como that had been present in this Italian\narea from August 2015 to November 2016 <br><br><strong>{9}</strong>. By the end of June 2017, D8 MV strains and B3 MV strains had caused\nclusters in 2 major Milanese hospitals. In August (current month)\n2017, the epidemic is still ongoing and the number of notified cases\nduring the month of July was almost twice the number of cases notified\nin June 2017. Other authors have already reported that where there\nis evidence of both nosocomial and community transmission of measles,\nnosocomial transmission appeared to precede community transmission\nwith a peak of hospital-acquired cases occurring almost 2 weeks before\nthe peak of the community outbreak <br><br><strong>{10}</strong>. In conclusion, the suboptimal immunization level (92.5 percent\nvaccination coverage rate in Lombardy Region; <br><br><strong>{11}</strong>) and the consequent\naccumulation of susceptible population have led to an increase in the\ntransmission of measles in northern Italy with detrimental effects on\nboth public health and ongoing measles elimination efforts.\nFurthermore, the nosocomial outbreaks highlight the importance of\nimproving measles vaccination coverage of healthcare workers.

Measles vaccination coverage is suboptimal in Italy (ranging between\n85.4 percent and 90.6 percent for one dose during the period\n2007-2016) <br><br><strong>{1}</strong>, which has led to large pockets of susceptible adults.\nWe describe an outbreak in an Italian hospital between February and\nApril 2017 among healthcare workers (HCW), hospital support personnel\n(hospital workers in activities not involving direct contact with\npatients), hospital visitors and community contacts. This outbreak was\npart of a wider epidemic in Italy that started in January 2017 and\nhas, as at Sun 30 Jul 2017, led to 4001 cases nationwide (275 in\nHCW) <br><br><strong>{2}</strong>. Outbreak description\n\nA HCW was referred to the emergency department (ED) of an Italian\nhospital for a rash developed after taking antibacterials for a mild\ncough and coryza. The rash was considered an allergic reaction to the\nantibacterial and the HCW was admitted to the hospital inpatient\nclinic. Three days later, the HCW's child was admitted to hospital for\na rash diagnosed as due to a non-communicable systemic disease. Subsequent serology showed that both the HCW and the child had\nmeasles. The origin of the infection for the index case is still\nunknown. It should be noted, however, that at least 10 community cases\nof measles occurred in the same period in the area of residence of the\nHCW. Using the standard case definition of the European Commission <br><br><strong>{3}</strong>, a\ntotal of 34 measles cases during the following weeks were identified\nby tracing the contacts of the index case. Among them, 15 were HCWs, 5\nwere support personnel, 4 were hospital visitors and 11 were community\ncontacts of the above cases. The secondary cases to the index (n = 8) occurred in 2 of the\nHCW's relatives, in 4 other HCWs, and in 2 support workers who were\nnot immediately recognized as belonging to the hospital outbreak. One\nof the secondary cases, a HCW, was in service until the onset of\nsymptoms, accessing all rooms on 2 inpatient wards. Tertiary cases\n(n = 6) involved the family of this HCW, 3 HCWs and a member of\nsupport personnel. A total of 2 weeks after the admission of the index case, 2 of the\nHCWs belonging to tertiary cases presented during the night to the ED\nwhere they stayed for nearly 10 hours. An additional 15 cases could be\ntraced following this single exposure window, namely 7 HCWs, 2 support\nworkers, 3 relatives of theirs and 3 visitors to the ED during the\ntime the 2 HCWs were present. One more community case was related to\ncontact outside hospital with one of the tertiary HCW cases.\nAdditional cases were related to a visitor at one of the involved\ninpatient wards, who probably got in contact with one of the tertiary\ncases who were HCW during the incubation period and generated 3 cases\nin the community, among them a family pediatrician. Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the epidemic curve and the outbreak tree\nfor figures, see original URL - Mod.LL. Characteristics of cases\n-\nUp to 6 cases occurred in children up to 9 years of age, while 2\noccurred in adolescents between 10 and 17 years and the majority of\ncases (n = 27) in adults 18 years and older. Figure 3 describes\nthe age distribution among different categories of cases. Vaccination status was known for 24 cases. Sixteen were unvaccinated\n(2 children, 14 adults), 2 had received one dose, one a full course of\n2 doses, and 5 cases occurred in contacts who received one dose of\npost-exposure vaccination. Of the 5 contacts who received post\nexposure vaccine, one was an infant younger than one year for whom\ninformation about the date of vaccination is not available; for the\nother 4, the delay between presumed contact date and immunization was\n3 days in 2 cases, 6 and 12 days for the remaining 2 cases. Among the\nHCWs, 2 were vaccinated, 11 were unvaccinated and for 2 of them the\ndata was unavailable. Among the 5 cases belonging to support personnel\n2 were unvaccinated and the status was unknown for the remaining 3. Genotyping was available for 3 cases: genotype B3, subtype 3.1 was\nfound in all of them. Conclusion and recommendations\n\nMeasles elimination in Europe, despite the immunization efforts, is\nstill jeopardized by recurrent outbreaks in susceptible populations\n4-7. Nosocomial transmission of measles is an important and emerging\nway of spreading the infection 8-11. Anyone staying in the hospital\nenvironment, regardless of role, can be affected because measles is\nhighly contagious and persists in the environment for up to 2 hours,\nthus requiring appropriate and timely infection control measures\n12,13.\nConsidering that transmission may occur 3 days before the onset of\nrash, early diagnosis when only non-specific preliminary symptoms\n(cough, coryza and conjunctivitis) are present is crucial for\ncontaining the outbreak <br><br><strong>{14}</strong>.\nA single exposure window, that occurred 2 weeks after the admission of\nthe index case, when 2 cases were present in the ED, resulted in\nfurther 15 cases. \nAppropriate procedures are needed for patients with suspect\ntransmissible infection in the ED, an issue not limited to measles but\nshared with several other highly infective conditions <br><br><strong>{13}</strong>.\nA 2-dose vaccination is the most effective measure to prevent measles\n<br><br><strong>{15}</strong>. This is of crucial importance for HCWs, with a view to their\nhigher risk of exposure and of transmission to vulnerable patients. However, it should be noted that in at least 5 cases in this outbreak,\nmeasles occurred in personnel working in the hospital environment in\nsupport functions, highlighting the need to take into consideration\nthe role of such personnel in the spread of the infection. Given that\nmost of the support personnel belong to outsourced services,\ncoordination is needed between occupational health unit and\noccupational health responsible of outsourced services. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) The full report can be found at the source URL. - Mod.ML There is no doubt that inadequate immunization levels are the major\ncontributor to outbreaks of measles. Most of this is due to not\nreceiving the 2 doses of vaccine due to personal or parenteral choice.\nAggressive programs to reverse this unfortunate trend are needed to\nprevent outbreaks of this potentially lethal disease. The nosocomial\nsetting as reflected in the 3rd post represents a special case\nsituation. It is not clear why health care workers are not required to\nbe immunized for measles. Additionally, when a case of measles is\nintroduced into a health care facility, it has been my experience that\nthe infection is not recognized promptly to minimize nosocomial\nspread. - Mod.LL  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at:\n(http://healthmap.org/promed/p/75).

Measles outbreaks have been registered in all 41 counties,\nthe most affected  with over 1000 cases each  being Timis (1215\ncases), Caras-Severin (1110), and Arad (1002). The measles outbreak in Romania in 2016 is not circumstantial, but a\ndirect consequence of the \"major\" malfunctions in public policy\nregarding vaccination, minister of health Florian Bodog stated on Fri\n11 Aug in a press release. \"For years now Romania has been below the\nsafety threshold of vaccination coverage. That is, the risk of a\nmeasles outbreak was imminent. Which is what actually happened. The\noutbreak of the measles epidemic in 2016 is not conjectural, it is a\ndirect consequence of major malfunctions in the public policy on\nvaccination,\" the minister of health stated. According to him, the Vaccination Law corrects the irregularities that\nled to the epidemic, providing the best conditions for protecting\nchildren's health. \"For Romania, the stake of the vaccination bill is\nhuge. Ensuring a healthy future for 4 million children lies in our\nhands. The Romanian parliament, the highest institution of democracy,\nwill decide on the final content of this law. However, beyond the\ndebates in parliament, it is important that all the public opinion be\ninformed and understand the true meaning of the law and the profound\nchanges it brings. (..) We have a moral duty towards our children, to\nprevent harm before it happens. As we also have a moral duty to the\ncommunity in which we live to prevent harm before it happens to other\nchildren or parents,\" Bodog said, quoted in the press release. He added that any bill is amendable and that is why it is open to any\npublic debates as long as they are carried out with honesty, good\nsense and decency. \"But this project is the day-to-day work of\nspecialists in the field of vaccination and who have faced all the\nflaws of the current framework. That is why the law has been carefully\nand correctly thought through by those who best understand how to\nregulate the vaccination policy,\" the minister of health also said. The bill on the organisation and funding of public vaccination in\nRomania was adopted by the government on Wed 9 Aug 2017. The bill\nwas submitted to parliament for debate and adoption. The normative act\nwould come into force on 1 Jan 2018. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) A similar report can be found in El Pais (12 Aug 2017) which states\nin addition that, of the 95 per cent vaccine coverage recommended by\nthe World Health Organization (WHO), 86 per cent have been\nvaccinated since 2007, according to its national epidemiological\ncentre. \"Highly worrying\" figures, acknowledged the prime minister,\nMihai Tudose, this week. \"More than 180 000 children in our country,\nfrom 9 months to 9 years, are not immunized against measles. In some\nregions, the rate of immunization of the 2nd dose does not reach 50\nper cent; and this is very serious.\" Timis and Caras-Severin, Arad\n(all to the west of the country, near the border with Serbia or\nHungary), are the most affected, with more than 1000 measles cases\neach, reported in the last 10 months when the outbreak was declared. According to official estimates, nearly 50 000 children without\nimmunization are not even registered with a family doctor. Most is due\nto serious problems of social exclusion.

The 6 people are now\nout of danger, and the 4 hospitalised patients were able to return\nhome, says the regional Agency of health (ARS), Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes,\ncited by France Bleu. These are all people who live or work in this\nsmall town of 1100 habitats. The ARS called for vigilance and prompted the inhabitants of the\nnorthern Ardèche, to consult a doctor in case of fever and appearance\nof buttons rash. It alerted on the very high contagiousness of the\nvirus that can infect up to 20 people around a sick person, and they\ncan produce severe, even life-threatening disease  in fact, there is\nno curative treatment for measles. In addition, the ARS has been reported to France Bleu that the recent\nconfirmed cases of measles in Ardoix were unvaccinated. According to\nthe figures of the LRA, 71 per cent of the inhabitants of the Ardèche\nregion are vaccinated against measles, which is 10 per cent less than\nthe national average. The government has confirmed its willingness to make mandatory 8\nvaccines, including measles. On this disease, \"Vaccination coverage\namong children at 2 years of age reaches only 78 per cent. As long as\nit does not reach the 95 per cent the risk of epidemic wave periodic\nwill persist\", has declared Agnès Buzyn. Measles has made its 1st victim in France at the end of July 2017.

The index case had just returned from visiting family in the Ukraine\nwhere he likely contracted the disease. When he returned to Israel he\nvisited a clinic where he infected 8 other soldiers who were waiting\nin line to see a physician. \"The IDF, together with the Health\nMinistry, carried out an investigation to locate the cases and\nidentify the source of the infection,\" the army said in a statement,\nadding that all those who had contact with the soldiers had been\ngiven preventative treatment. An IDF spokesman told The Jerusalem Post\nthat the soldier who contracted the disease had 2 stopovers in Europe\non his way back to Israel from the Ukraine but was not able to specify\nwhich countries. WHO in March 2017 warned of a measles outbreak sweeping across\nEurope in places where immunization rates have plummeted. The figures\ncover the agency's entire European region  53 countries including\nIsrael, Kazakhstan, and Russia. According to WHO 559 measles cases\nwere reported in Europe between January and March 2017. While the\nlargest current measles outbreaks in Europe were reported in Romania\nand Italy, other countries reporting cases were France, Germany,\nPoland, Switzerland, and the Ukraine. \"With steady progress toward\nelimination over the past 2 years, it is of particular concern that\nmeasles cases are climbing in Europe,\" said Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO\nregional director for Europe. \"Today's travel patterns put no person\nor country beyond the reach of the measles virus. Outbreaks will\ncontinue in Europe, as elsewhere, until every country reaches the\nlevel of immunization needed to fully protect their populations.\" Israeli children are routinely immunized with the MMR measles, mumps,\nrubella vaccine which are given in 2 doses, at 1 year and a booster\nin the 1st grade. The Health Ministry has stated that the level of\nvaccine coverage in Israel is among the highest in the West, with 97\nper cent coverage for 1st and 2nd doses MMR and chickenpox vaccine. While no vaccine is 100 per cent effective, an infectious disease\nspecialist told the Post that measles is \"a nasty illness\" that is\npreventable by proper immunization. But while it is highly recommended\nby medical professionals and the Health Ministry, the vaccine is not\nmandatory and according to the IDF the measles vaccine is not part of\nthe vaccines given to new recruits. \"We cannot afford to have soldiers\nwho are severely ill with a highly contagious disease. It would be\nappropriate for the IDF to verify and update immunizations of all\npersonnel and new recruits,\" the infectious disease specialist told\nthe Post. Measles is spread by coughing and sneezing and close contact with\ninfected individuals. While most infected people usually experience\nonly mild symptoms it is one of the leading causes of death among\nyoung children globally. Measles takes about 8-12 days following\ncontact before the individual will show symptoms which include a\nfever, bad cough, red eyes, and a runny nose. A few days after the\nrespiratory symptoms, the infected individual will get a bad rash.\nOther complications of measles include gastroenteritis (diarrhea and\nvomiting), pneumonia, severe bleeding problems, and in some rare cases\nencephalitis (brain infections). In June 2017, 5 cases of measles were reported to the Health\nMinistry  all of them women between the ages of 20-40 who lived in\nJerusalem. byline: Anna Ahronheim \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) Even with 97 per cent vaccine coverage, measles virus can cause small\noutbreaks.

Measles is an airborne disease that affects mostly children between\nthe ages of 6 months and 10 years, although it can also affect\nadults. Although Prof Mbonye said there was no cause for alarm, he urged the\npublic to be vigilant and report any suspected cases to the nearest\nhealth facilities. The public has also been urged to look out for\ncommon early symptoms associated with the disease, which include high\nfever, cough, red swelling eyelids and muscle and body irritability. According to the Ministry of Health, an estimated 20 per cent of\npeople who get infected with measles often develop complications,\nwhich if not managed early enough can lead to death. Despite previous\nmass vaccination campaigns, Uganda has had several outbreaks of the\ndisease. Prof Mbonye blamed it on parents who do not take their\nchildren for immunisation at the right time. Current national\nimmunisation coverage stands at 85 per cent. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) According to WHO, in 2016 global vaccination coverage (all vaccines)\nwas stalled at 86 per cent, with no significant changes during the\npast year. For measles alone, by the end of 2016, 85 per cent of\nchildren had received 1 dose of vaccine by their 2nd birthday, and 164\ncountries had included a 2nd dose as part of routine immunization; 64\nper cent of children received 2 doses of measles vaccine according to\nnational immunization schedules. It is generally thought that because\nmeasles is such a highly transmissible disease, that 90-95 per cent of\npeople must be vaccinated in order to protect the entire population,\nor achieve herd immunity.

Source: Express (edited) (http://www.express.co.uk/news/nature/844891/Asian-mosquitos-Britain-Eurotunnel-dengue-fever-chikungunya-virus-UK)   Health specialists have blitzed a clutch of notorious Asian tiger mosquitoes suspected to have smuggled their way into Britain through the Eurotunnel. The invasive Asiatic mosquitoes can carry dengue fever and the chikungunya virus, and attack in daylight.  Experts from Public Health England destroyed the batch of mosquito eggs and larvae at the busy Ashford International truck stop earlier this month August 2017. This is the 2nd time that one of the planet's most dangerous insects  so-named because of its striped body and legs  has been discovered entering into the UK during the last year.  Asian tiger mosquitoes  scientific name, _Aedes albopictus_  have been spreading across Europe and are blamed for up to a million global cases of chikungunya globally every year. The disease has no cure and leaves victims in a fever and with excruciating joint pains as well as headaches, nausea and rashes. There is a death risk of one in a thousand cases. France confirmed 4 cases in 2014 and there was an epidemic in Italy a decade ago.  Asian tiger mosquitoes are spreading the disease through the way their eggs and larvae have been exported from native forest haunts in south east Asia in tyre imports. The grubs eggs can survive for months and larvae and pupae develop in small pockets of water retained by tyres.  To counter the threat, the authorities are maintaining a \"mosquito surveillance programme\" at 30 UK ports and airports as well as checks at motorway services on routes from south coast ports and Eurotunnel. Dr Jenny Harries, deputy medical director at Public Health England, said: \"Through these activities we identified a small number of eggs and larvae from the _Aedes albopictus_ mosquito in traps at Ashford International truck stop.  byline: Stuart Winter   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  This report of the discovery of _Aedes albopictus_ at a truck stop in Kent appears to be valid this time and illustrates how this species can be moved internationally. A 2014 report of _Aedes aegypti_ in southern England was rejected. A statement by Jolyon Medlock, head of Medical Entomology & Zoonoses Ecology, Public Health England, Microbiological Research Authority (MRA), Emergency Response Department, Health Protection and Medical Directorate, Porton Down, Salisbury stated, \"This is misleading information as no invasive aedes mosquitoes have been found in the UK. There have been a number of news articles in British newspapers recently 2014 about invasive mosquitoes, reporting mainly on efforts to increase surveillance for _Aedes albopictus_, however no confirmed reports of any invasive aedes mosquito have been found during this surveillance, nor have any reports been submitted to the Medical Entomology group at Public Health England.\" (see Invasive mosquito - UK (02): (England) comment http://promedmail.org/post/20140923.2795988).  Intensive surveillance will be carried out this time as well. One hopes that successful aggressive efforts to eliminate the mosquitoes before they can become established, as they have become established in Italy and southern France. - Mod.TY  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6406).

Public Health Gibraltar and the Environmental\nAgency confirmed that the mosquito of the species _Aedes albopictus_,\nalso known as the tiger mosquito, has been found in Gibraltar. Last June 2017 after 9 months of intensive surveillance, officials\nsaid no tiger mosquito had been found in Gibraltar. But this has now\nchanged after the 1st tiger mosquito was found in the urban domestic\nenvironment within Gibraltar. \"This finding alone does not however\nmaterially alter any health risks in Gibraltar and there is no\nimmediate cause for public concern,\" the government said in a\nstatement. Public Health Gibraltar was first alerted in January 2016 to the\ndiscovery of the mosquito in Málaga and Algeciras in Andalusia,\nSpain. Since then, together with the Environmental Agency, it began\nworking with international experts to mount surveillance in Gibraltar.\nWorld Health Organization experts visited Gibraltar and gave advice on\nsetting traps and monitoring locations, but no tiger mosquito had been\ndetected until now. The tiger mosquito is not native to Gibraltar and has not been\npreviously found here. It is common in other countries where it\ntransmits viral diseases like Zika, dengue, and chikungunya. It is a\ndomestic species, breeds in water in urban areas  water butts,\nblocked drains, rainwater gullies  and is able to reach high\nabundance around residential areas. It is also a day-time mosquito,\nthat aggressively bites humans. \"Health risks to the public only arise if the virus causing these\ndiseases is also present, which is not the case in Gibraltar,\" the\ngovernment said. \"The virus can, however, be imported by travellers\nreturning from an overseas country and if this happens, there is a\nrisk of spread, but only if the mosquito bites within a small window\nperiod of about a week after the fever starts.\" Public Health Gibraltar has been raising awareness of travel risk\namongst travellers through its publication A Factsheet for Travellers\nand recommends the following precautions:\n- before travelling to affected areas, consult your doctor or seek\nadvice from a travel clinic, especially if you have an immune disorder\nor severe chronic illness;\n- if you are pregnant or are considering pregnancy, consider\npostponing non-essential travel;\n- when staying in a mosquito-prone area, wear mosquito repellents and\ntake mosquito bite prevention measures;\n- if you have symptoms within 3 weeks of return from an affected\ncountry, contact your doctor;\n- if you have been diagnosed with any of the diseases Zika, dengue, or\nchikungunya, take strict mosquito bite prevention measures for 10 days\nafter the fever starts. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) The appearance of _Aedes albopictus_ in Gibraltar is not surprising.\nA map of the distribution of this species as of April this year (2017)\nshows it present around the Mediterranean Basin and up to Gibraltar on\nthe west\n((https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/aedes-albopictus-current-known-distribution-europe-april-2017)).\nNow it has been found in Gibraltar. The concerns are real about\ntransmission of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses should\npopulations of _Ae. albopictus_ become established. In 2015 there were\na few locally acquired cases of dengue in the south of France. This\nalso happened on a larger scale in Emilia Romagna, Italy, when a\nviremic man introduced chikungunya virus into Italy and sparked an\noutbreak. One hopes that mosquito surveillance will continue in\nGibraltar, perhaps be intensified, and help guide vector control\nefforts. - Mod.TY A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at:\n(http://healthmap.org/promed/p/517).

The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare is advising tourists to go to hospital if they develop a high fever or generalized rash after returning to Japan.  Although the World Health Organization verified that Japan has eliminated infections of endemic measles strains in 2015, group infections originating from people who contracted the disease abroad are spreading in the country. As of 6 Aug 2017, the number of patients reached 169 this year in Japan, already eclipsing the figure in the previous year.  About 4100 patients in Italy and around 6500 patients in Romania have already been confirmed as of August 2017 compared with about 860 and 2000, respectively, throughout 2016, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.  Symptoms of the highly contagious disease include runny nose, red and watery eyes, high fever, and rash. The virus is spread through coughing and sneezing and can cause complications such as pneumonia and can even result in death in one in 1000 patients, according to the ministry. The ministry recommends people traveling overseas to check their vaccination records and take an additional shot if they have only been vaccinated once.  The disease was prevalent about a decade ago in Japan with the number of patients soaring to over 10 000 in 2008 but the country was later considered as free from infections of the virus.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Japan can be found at (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/156). - Mod.LK   <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Australia (Perth, Western Australia): ex Italy.

Large measles outbreak introduced by asylum seekers and spread among the insufficiently vaccinated resident population, Berlin, October 2014 to August 2015. Euro Surveill. 2017; 22(34): pii=30599 - Abstract  The largest measles outbreak in Berlin since 2001 occurred from October 2014 to August 2015. Overall, 1344 cases were ascertained, 86 per cent (with available information) unvaccinated, including 146 (12 per cent) asylum seekers. Median age was 17 years (interquartile range: 4-29 years), 26 per cent were hospitalised and a 1 year old child died. Measles virus genotyping uniformly revealed the variant 'D8-Rostov-Don' and descendants. The virus was likely introduced by and initially spread among asylum seekers before affecting Berlin's resident population. Among Berlin residents, the highest incidence was in children younger than 2 years, yet most cases (52 per cent) were adults. Post-exposure vaccinations in homes for asylum seekers, not always conducted, occurred later (median: 7.5 days) than the recommended 72 hours after onset of the 1st case and reached only half of potential contacts. Asylum seekers should not only have non-discriminatory, equitable access to vaccination, they also need to be offered measles vaccination in a timely fashion, that is, immediately upon arrival in the receiving country. Supplementary immunisation activities targeting the resident population, particularly adults, are urgently needed in Berlin.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail.

Source: Romania Insider (edited) (https://www.romania-insider.com/measles-kills-iraqi-refugee/)   The ongoing measles outbreak keeps making victims in Romania. A 10 month old girl, who was a refugee from Iraq, became the 33rd person to die of the infection, reports local Digi24. The girl arrived in Romania on 7 Jul 2017 with her family, and the doctors diagnosed her with measles in August. They also discovered that the child was suffering from malnutrition and severe psychomotor retardation.  The measles outbreak is still a major problem in Romania, with more than 8900 cases reported across the country until 25 Aug 2017, including 33 deaths, according to data from the National Center for Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases (CNSCBT). Most deaths were registered in Timis (9), Dolj (7), and Arad (6) counties.  Measles is a highly contagious respiratory infection caused by a virus. It causes a total-body skin rash and flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough, and runny nose. According to information posted on WHO's website, the virus is highly contagious, spreading by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact, and direct contact with infected nasal or throat secretions. Unvaccinated young children pose the highest risk of measles and its complications, including death.  The Romanian Government adopted earlier this month August 2017 a draft bill on the organization and financing of population vaccination (https://www.romania-insider.com/romania-draft-bill-vaccination/). The project was sent to the Parliament for approval and could come into force in January 2018.  byline: Irina Marica   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Measles tends to be more severe in children who are malnourished, especially children who are also vitamin A deficient. And complications are commoner and more serious in malnourished children. Because of complications such as diarrhoea, measles may lead to failure to thrive. Infection with measles virus may lead to kwashiorkor or marasmus in children who are underweight at the time that they get infected. Therefore, measles may result in, or aggravate, malnutrition.

Source: News-Medical/Life Sciences (edited) (https://www.news-medical.net/news/20170826/New-study-highlights-role-played-by-demographics-in-the-spread-of-measles.aspx)   Even if the incidence of measles infection has decreased by at least 90 per cent worldwide since the introduction of the vaccine, measles is still one of the major causes of death in children among vaccine-preventable diseases. Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world.  A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries.  Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years.  \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\"  \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea\".  The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years 2 million DALYs since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln 13 million DALYs in the US, and 36-mln 36 million DALYs in Ethiopia.  \"Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,\" continues Prof Melegaro \"our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population. Tailoring immunization campaigns to achieve measles eradication goals is essential and currently, for some countries, this means considering also the role of unprotected adolescents and young adults.\"   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Reference - Trentini F, Poletti P, Merler S, Melegaro A.

From: Antonio Battisti (antonio.battisti@izslt.it) (edited)   The diagnosis of Anthrax was done at Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale del Lazio e della Toscana (IZSLT), in Rome, Italy (same province of the outbreak) after an onsite inspection by vets from IZSLT who were called by the Local Veterinary Services, on Fri 25 Aug 2017.  During the inspection, IZSLT decided that Anthrax was the main etiology to be firstly investigated. Four bovine animals found dead at inspection site (a pasture in the municipality of Grottaferrata, province of Rome, Italy), most probably dead in the latter 4-5 hours, were sampled (blood samples, following the international consensus procedures). The Veterinary Services disposed of fallen stock (destruction) according to EU legislation (the 4 animals plus another one that was found dead nearby by the Veterinary Services).  All 4 cases investigated were preliminarly diagnosed as Anthrax cases on the same day, by microscopic examination of blood smears stained with polychrome methylene blue (McFedyan's reaction), and confirmed by cultures and PCR (chromosomal target, pXO1 and pXO2 plasmidic targets) by the next Mon 28 Aug 2017. These are the only cases that were confirmed as Anthrax by a laboratory diagnosis.  The area is an historical Anthrax site and pastures are located in the crater of an extinct volcano, not far from the Albano Lake, itself a lake of volcanic origin. Anthrax cases in livestock living in the area are considered absolutely sporadic nowadays, thanks to the intense vaccine prevention measures of the past decades (from the late 1950s of the 20th century). The outbreak may have been favored by the severe drought ongoing in Central Italy. This is the only outbreak notified in 2017 in the Latium Region.

Prior to onset of illness, the family was staying at Bibione, Province of Venice (seaside resort) and on 13 Aug 2017, the girl was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus at the Portogruaro hospital (40 km approx 28 mi north of Venice). 2. The family including the girl returned to Trento where they live on 16 Aug 2017 and she was admitted to the hospital for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. She was discharged on 21 Aug 2017. 3. On 16 Aug 2017, 2 children from Burkina Faso with falciparum malaria were admitted to the same children's ward in Trento hospital. 4. Fever was reported in the girl on 28 Aug 2017, the fever then disappeared but returned on 30 Aug 2017 when she was again hospitalized at Trento hospital. Malaria was diagnosed and treatment was started. On 2 Sep 2017 she was air-lifted to the University Hospital in Brescia with a diagnosis of cerebral malaria.   \n<br><br>Communicated by: EpiCore Global Surveillance Project (promed@promedmail.org)  ProMED-mail would like to thank all of the EpiCore members who responded to the request for more information on this event.   The overlap with the 2 cases from Burkina Faso was 5 days and thus infection would have had to have beeen through direct transmission by blood and not through mosquitoes. If the needle used for blood sugar testing in some manner was shared between the known malaria patients and the young girl who had been hospitalized for diabetes, then nosocomial transmission is a possibility.  An alternative possibility is that the infection occurred from local Italian mosquitoes that had been infected by an asymptomatic gametocyte carrier. This is well known to happen and malaria was endemic in northern Italy in the past especially in the period between both world wars when there was a high prevalence of the disease, but it was _P.vivax_ and not _P. falciparum_. Whether the local mosquitoes (_A. maculipennis_ complex) are capable of transmitting _P. falciparum_ malaria is not known, but the possibility is not excluded.  )From infection to the debut of symptoms, the incubation period is usually 7 - 10 days in non-immune individuals. If the hospitalization for the suspected diabetes mellitus in Portogruaro hospital was in fact when she presented with the 1st symptoms of malaria, then she was most likely infected 7 - 10 days previously, however, fever would have been a key presenting symptom.  Thus the key question is when did the 1st symptoms of malaria actually appear  and the only certain point in the information we presently have is that she was febrile on 28 Aug 2017.  There is a huge variability from the time the symptoms started to the time of death in imported (non-immune) malaria cases. A large study of 22 fatal outcomes of patient with _P. falciparum_ malaria returning to Switzerland (Christen et al. Am J Trop Med Hyg 2006;75:1188-94) reported an average of 8 days with a low of 3 days. Thus if the 1st symptoms of malaria were on 28 Aug 2017, the date of actual infection must have taken place within the 10 prior days.  Does the climate allow development of the malaria parasite in the mosquito? The average temperature for Trento in August 2017 is found here: (https://www.accuweather.com/en/it/trento/216357/august-weather/216357). The average night temperature is only reaching 20 C (approx. 68 F) on 18 Aug 2017, otherwise it was well below 20 C (approx. 68 F) with a low of 13 C (approx. 55 F). In order to allow _P.falciparum_ to develop in mosquitoes, the average night temperature must be 20 C (approx. 68 F) or more for 8 - 10 days. Thus the temperature in Trento in August 2017 excludes the possibility the 2 patients from Burkina Faso infected local mosquitoes, which then infected the patient.  The average temperature for Bibione in August 2017 is found here: (https://www.accuweather.com/en/it/bibione/2550920/august-weather/2550920). )From 1 Aug 2017 to 20 Aug 2017 the average night temperature was above 20 C approx. 68 F except for 2 days (12 and 13 Aug 2017) and thus the _P. falciparum_ parasite had the climatic conditions to develop in the mosquito if local mosquitoes are able to transmit _p. falciparum_ and were infected by a gametocyte carrier.  The risk of reintroducing malaria in Italy was discussed in Romi et al. in 2012 (Romi R et al. Probable autochthonous introduced malaria cases in Italy in 2009-2011 and the risk of local vector-borne transmission. Euro Surveill. 2012 Nov 29;17(48). pii: 20325). In Trento (Province of Trentino) the _Anopheles_ species in _A. maculipennis_ complex is present which is regarded as zoophilic (not preferring humans).  In conclusion, it is a possibility that the girl was infected by mosquitoes during her stay in Bibione, but nosocomial infection in Trento is an alternative explanation. - Mod.EP  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/75).

It is important to note puffer fish are highly poisonous and should only prepared by trained, licensed chefs who know one bad cut means almost certain death for a customer.  Surprisingly, the meat of some puffer fish is considered a delicacy, especially in Japan.  But here's why you should perhaps avoid it completely:   - According to National Geographic, tetrodotoxin is deadly, up to 1200 times more poisonous than cyanide. One puffer fish has enough toxin to kill 30 adults.   - The puffer fish is the 2nd most poisonous vertebrate on the planet. Its poison has no antidote and kills by paralyzing the diaphragm, causing suffocation.   - Almost all puffer fish contain tetrodotoxin, a substance that makes them taste bad (and sometimes lethal) to other fish.   - Tetrodotoxin does not cross the blood-brain barrier, so the victims remain fully conscious while their central nervous system gradually shuts down. Symptoms such as numbness in the mouth, lips, and tongue occur within 30 minutes to 3 hours from an intake and after that, the victim begins to experience headaches, nausea and even vomiting. The rest of the body slowly becomes paralysed, causing death when the heart and lung muscles are also paralysed.   - In Japan, the most lethal part, the liver, cannot be sold, and the whole fish is banned in the European Union.  - There are more than 120 species of puffer fish worldwide. Most of them are found in tropical and subtropical ocean waters. However, some species live in brackish and even fresh water. They have long, tapered bodies with bulbous heads.  - The puffer fish protects itself in the wild by gulping down water and swelling up its belly to make itself look bigger. It does this because, apparently, it can't find a way to communicate the simple message, \"I am poisonous,\"(io9.gizmodo.com) says  Byline: Mildred Europa Taylor   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org) And Epicore member Addo Michael Brown  Tetrodotoxin is a colorless crystal substance that darkens when heated above 400 degrees F or approximately 220 C.  Tetrodotoxin is an extremely potent toxin (poison) found mainly in the liver and gonads of some fish, notably puffer fish, or fugu, but also globefish (sometimes puffer fish are also called globefish), and toadfish as well as some amphibians, octopus, and shellfish species. Human poisonings occur when the flesh and/or organs of the fish are improperly prepared and eaten. Tetrodotoxin interferes with the transmission of signals from nerves to muscles and causes an increasing paralysis of the muscles of the body. Tetrodotoxin poisoning can be fatal.  These creatures are likely fatal when prepared inappropriately, and should be handled with extreme caution for the everyday untrained person. We are sorry for the families of these individuals.

A 5 year old girl is in a critical condition and 2 others are severely ill after eating a supermarket potato salad product infected with _Escherichia coli_ O157, Saitama Prefecture said on Mon 21 Aug 2017. The victims all ate potato salad sold at the Shokusaikan Marche Kagohara supermarket in the city of Kumagaya, Saitama prefecture, the prefecture said. In addition to the girl, who remains unconscious, a 4 year old boy and a 60 year old woman have been hospitalized. All 3 are not expected to be discharged soon.  According to Saitama prefecture, the supermarket's deli  Derishasu Kagohara  procured the potato salad from a food-processing factory from outside the prefecture, then mixed cut pieces of ham and apples. The Kumagaya Public Health Center has ordered that the deli be closed for 3 days amid an investigation into the food poisoning, including what caused the _E. coli_ infection and the routes through which the salad was distributed.  The incident came to light after the prefecture was notified of a boy being admitted to a Gunma prefecture hospital on 14 Aug 2017. The Kumagaya Public Health Center learned that 8 Saitama residents, who all ate the potato salad sold on 7 and 8 Aug 2017, complained of stomach pains. 3 others ranging in age from 7 to 12 were also hospitalized for symptoms such as diarrhea, but have been released from hospitals already.  The 5 year old girl who remains in critical condition has been diagnosed with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a condition caused by an abnormal destruction of red blood cells.  Fresh Corp, a Gunma-based supermarket and deli store chain, said no other outlets have reported cases of food poisoning.

(promed@promedmail.org)  It is not clear if the individuals who became ill earlier in the month also suffered from enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ infection. Potato salad seems to be the vehicle for transmission of the infection. Since potatoes are served after cooking, the likely source is not the potatoes themselves but rather an ingredient added to the food. Pork products are not common carriers of EHEC but this has been reported (E. coli EHEC - Canada (04): (AB) O157, pork products, recall http://promedmail.org/post/20140909.2759887). Apples can carry EHEC especially if harvested after falling from the tree and outbreaks have occurred from unpasteurized apple juice or cider (E. coli EHEC - USA (19): (CA) O111, unpasteurized apple juice, alert, recall http://promedmail.org/post/20151107.3774944; E. coli, toxigenic, apple cider - USA (Oklahoma) http://promedmail.org/post/19991019.1857). It is also possible that cross contamination during preparation from other foods could have occurred related to poor kitchen hygiene. ProMED-mail would like more information regarding this outbreak.  It may be recalled by ProMED-mail readers and evident from the flurry of ProMED-mail postings from Japan in 1996 and 1997 shown below that substantially more cases of this disease occurred in that time frame.

The 1st involves a suspended grilled-meat restaurant in Yokohama Kanagawa prefecture, linked to the illnesses of a teenage girl and a man in his 80s who ate there on 30 Jul 2017.  The 2nd involves a deli in the Saitama Prefecture and a potato salad product sold at the Shokusaikan Marche Kagohara supermarket in Kumagaya. The potato salad has sickened 14, including a 5 year old girl who is in a critical condition along with 2 others who are severely ill.  The supermarket's deli  known as Derishasu Kagohara  purchased the potato salad from a food processing facility located outside the prefecture and then mixed it with cut pieces of ham and apples. Kumagaya Public Health has ordered the deli closed for 3 days while it investigates the source of the _E. coli_ infection and its distribution.  The investigation into the illness of a boy admitted to the Gunma Prefecture hospital on 14 Aug 2017 led to the deli's contamination. The deli appears to have sold the 1st suspect potato salad on 7-8 Aug 2017, after which 8 Saitama residents reported stomach pains. Others, ages 7 to 12, were treated for diarrhea. The 5 year old has developed the kidney-threatening disease known as a hemolytic uremic syndrome or HUS.  The potato salad distribution is apparently limited to the Gunma and Saitama prefectures.

The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare is advising tourists to go to hospital if they develop a high fever or generalized rash after returning to Japan.  Although the World Health Organization verified that Japan has eliminated infections of endemic measles strains in 2015, group infections originating from people who contracted the disease abroad are spreading in the country. As of 6 Aug 2017, the number of patients reached 169 this year in Japan, already eclipsing the figure in the previous year.  About 4100 patients in Italy and around 6500 patients in Romania have already been confirmed as of August 2017 compared with about 860 and 2000, respectively, throughout 2016, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.  Symptoms of the highly contagious disease include runny nose, red and watery eyes, high fever, and rash. The virus is spread through coughing and sneezing and can cause complications such as pneumonia and can even result in death in one in 1000 patients, according to the ministry. The ministry recommends people traveling overseas to check their vaccination records and take an additional shot if they have only been vaccinated once.  The disease was prevalent about a decade ago in Japan with the number of patients soaring to over 10 000 in 2008 but the country was later considered as free from infections of the virus.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Japan can be found at (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/156). - Mod.LK   <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Australia (Perth, Western Australia): ex Italy.

Large measles outbreak introduced by asylum seekers and spread among the insufficiently vaccinated resident population, Berlin, October 2014 to August 2015. Euro Surveill. 2017; 22(34): pii=30599 - Abstract  The largest measles outbreak in Berlin since 2001 occurred from October 2014 to August 2015. Overall, 1344 cases were ascertained, 86 per cent (with available information) unvaccinated, including 146 (12 per cent) asylum seekers. Median age was 17 years (interquartile range: 4-29 years), 26 per cent were hospitalised and a 1 year old child died. Measles virus genotyping uniformly revealed the variant 'D8-Rostov-Don' and descendants. The virus was likely introduced by and initially spread among asylum seekers before affecting Berlin's resident population. Among Berlin residents, the highest incidence was in children younger than 2 years, yet most cases (52 per cent) were adults. Post-exposure vaccinations in homes for asylum seekers, not always conducted, occurred later (median: 7.5 days) than the recommended 72 hours after onset of the 1st case and reached only half of potential contacts. Asylum seekers should not only have non-discriminatory, equitable access to vaccination, they also need to be offered measles vaccination in a timely fashion, that is, immediately upon arrival in the receiving country. Supplementary immunisation activities targeting the resident population, particularly adults, are urgently needed in Berlin.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail.

Source: Romania Insider (edited) (https://www.romania-insider.com/measles-kills-iraqi-refugee/)   The ongoing measles outbreak keeps making victims in Romania. A 10 month old girl, who was a refugee from Iraq, became the 33rd person to die of the infection, reports local Digi24. The girl arrived in Romania on 7 Jul 2017 with her family, and the doctors diagnosed her with measles in August. They also discovered that the child was suffering from malnutrition and severe psychomotor retardation.  The measles outbreak is still a major problem in Romania, with more than 8900 cases reported across the country until 25 Aug 2017, including 33 deaths, according to data from the National Center for Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases (CNSCBT). Most deaths were registered in Timis (9), Dolj (7), and Arad (6) counties.  Measles is a highly contagious respiratory infection caused by a virus. It causes a total-body skin rash and flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough, and runny nose. According to information posted on WHO's website, the virus is highly contagious, spreading by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact, and direct contact with infected nasal or throat secretions. Unvaccinated young children pose the highest risk of measles and its complications, including death.  The Romanian Government adopted earlier this month August 2017 a draft bill on the organization and financing of population vaccination (https://www.romania-insider.com/romania-draft-bill-vaccination/). The project was sent to the Parliament for approval and could come into force in January 2018.  byline: Irina Marica   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Measles tends to be more severe in children who are malnourished, especially children who are also vitamin A deficient. And complications are commoner and more serious in malnourished children. Because of complications such as diarrhoea, measles may lead to failure to thrive. Infection with measles virus may lead to kwashiorkor or marasmus in children who are underweight at the time that they get infected. Therefore, measles may result in, or aggravate, malnutrition.

Source: News-Medical/Life Sciences (edited) (https://www.news-medical.net/news/20170826/New-study-highlights-role-played-by-demographics-in-the-spread-of-measles.aspx)   Even if the incidence of measles infection has decreased by at least 90 per cent worldwide since the introduction of the vaccine, measles is still one of the major causes of death in children among vaccine-preventable diseases. Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world.  A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries.  Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years.  \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\"  \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea\".  The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years 2 million DALYs since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln 13 million DALYs in the US, and 36-mln 36 million DALYs in Ethiopia.  \"Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,\" continues Prof Melegaro \"our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population. Tailoring immunization campaigns to achieve measles eradication goals is essential and currently, for some countries, this means considering also the role of unprotected adolescents and young adults.\"   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Reference - Trentini F, Poletti P, Merler S, Melegaro A.

This came about after 2\nkidney recipients in Taiwan were diagnosed with dengue 2 days after\nreceiving a kidney each from the same donor, said National Cheng Kung\nUniversity microbiology and immunology professor Dr Oscar Perng\nGuey-chuen. \"This indicates a potential risk,\" the Taiwan-based\nscientist said, adding that no dengue virus was detected in the\ndonor's blood. He said the donor contracted dengue in 2015 and in mid-2016, he died\nin an accident. His family donated his corneas, liver, heart, and\nkidneys. Both patients had the same strain of the dengue virus the\ndonor had in 2015 and one of the recipients died of dengue\nhaemorrhagic fever, he said. Asked where the virus could be hiding since it could not be detected\nin the blood, he said it was a question scientists are trying to\nanswer. Interestingly, those who received the donor's corneas, liver,\nand heart did not develop dengue, Dr Perng said on the sidelines of\nthe National Dengue And Arboviruses Infection Conference 2017\nyesterday 12 Aug 2017. He said although there was not enough\nevidence to show the virus came from the donor as the kidneys were not\ntested for dengue before the transplant, the same virus was found in\nthe patients' bodies after that. Dr Perng said his team had studied mice for dengue virus in the blood\ntestes, kidney, liver, spleen and brain, and found the virus present\nin the kidneys and brain. \"We believe the virus probably resided in\nthe kidneys and was not cleared by the body,\" he said, adding that the\nvirus could have been activated after transplant. He said this raised\nconcerns about asymptomatic people who are dengue carriers. Health Ministry deputy director, general Datuk Dr S Jeyaindran said\npatients with severe dengue would have better recovery if they were\ngiven colloids, a more concentrated fluid, at the early stage in fluid\nmanagement for dengue patients. Dr Jeyaindran, who was representing\nHealth Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam, said colloids may be\nintroduced at an earlier stage, instead of saline because it has not\nbeen successful in treating patients with severe dengue. He said more\nstudies will be conducted to find out at which stage the colloids\nshould be given. byline: Loh Foon Fong \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) - Air travel related spread of dengue.\nDate: Thu 3 Aug 2017.\nSource: Medical Xpress (edited)\n(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-08-air-responsible-dengue-asia.html) \nWhile the incidences of many other infectious diseases have declined\nover the past decade, the number of cases and outbreaks of dengue\nvirus have continued to increase. The spread of dengue to new areas is\nlikely due in large part to trends in air travel, researchers now\nreport in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Dengue virus affects as estimated 390 million people around the globe\neach year, and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild fever and\nheadache to severe low blood pressure. The virus has mostly caused\ndisease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, but a 2014\noutbreak in Japan broke that pattern. Overall, the geographic area\naffected by dengue has been growing in recent years. In the new work, Huaiyu Tian and Bing Xu, both of Beijing Normal\nUniversity, China, together with colleagues from the University of\nOxford and elsewhere analyzed the spread of dengue viruses in Asia\nfrom 1956 to 2015. They used 2202 genetic sequences of dengue viruses,\ncollected in 20 countries or regions of Asia over the 59 years, to\ndetermine how different strains were related. They also investigated\ntrends in air travel, maritime mobility, migration, and\nsocio-economics to determine what factors impact the spread of\ndengue. The spread of 3 different dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1, -2, and -3,\nis associated with air traffic more so than any other factors, the\ndata revealed. Air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India, the\nresearchers found, help seed dengue epidemics, while China, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, and Singapore help diffuse the virus to other Asian\ncountries. \"Future trends in global mobility could potentially accelerate the\nappearance and diffusion of DENV worldwide,\" the researchers say.\n\"Prevention and control of dengue epidemics requires a better\nunderstanding of its mode of geographic dissemination, especially for\ncountries in the tropics.\" Reference: Tian H, Sun Z, Faria NR, et al.

The same bacterial genotype has also been detected in people as far away as Shiga, Mie and Niigata prefectures.  Keen to ascertain the sources of infection as well as the extent to which the O157 strain has spread, the health ministry sent out a notification on Fri 1 Sep 2017 to local authorities across the country. The notice encourages local authorities to ask people infected with the strain what they have eaten and whether or not they have traveled. This summer, the number of O157 _E. coli_ cases has been higher than in an ordinary year. In response, the National Institute of Infectious Diseases examined the bacterial genotype of the strain in infected people in 144 cases between 14 and 20 Aug 2017, and found that it was consistent in most cases.  \nThe health ministry has deemed that food and other items from the same source of contamination are being distributed across a wide area. As a result, it is feared that patients coming into contact with these items are spreading the O157 strain.  To tackle the issue, the health ministry has told local authorities across the country to perform a genotype test and to confirm detailed information relating to the use of swimming pools and any contact with animals in patients found to have the same strain as that found in Saitama and Gunma prefectures. In addition, it has asked companies that provide meals to schools to take robust preventative measures against possible infection, especially as children across the country are now returning to class from summer vacation.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail.

The meat of the dead cows was sent for testing in the laboratories of Astana and Almaty, but so far there are no results see comment below. It is only known that before dying the temperature of the animals rises, and there is weakness and lumps under the skin.  In the summer of 2016, the Atyrau oblast similarly suffered a massive loss of livestock; more than 800 cattle died. All of them had nodular dermatitis. More than 6000 cattle were infected with the disease.  byline: Alexandra Titova   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  From 10 to 15 Jun 2016, a disease which later was recognized as lumpy skin disease (LSD) was recorded in a cattle holding on the territory adjacent to the village of Chapayevo, West Kazakhstan (see archive no. http://promedmail.org/post/20160717.4350687; at this point in time, laymen, followed by the media, erroneously related to the undiagnosed and most probably unfamiliar new disease as foot and mouth disease. Please see relevant commentary in the subsequent postings no. http://promedmail.org/post/20160722.4362368 and http://promedmail.org/post/20160723.4365082).  On 7 Jul 2016, Kazakhstan reported (see archive no. http://promedmail.org/post/20160722.4363497) a single LSD outbreak in Makasch, Kurmangazinskiy, Mangashlak (western to Atyrau; map at (http://tinyurl.com/ycb4j9h7)), stating that it had started on 7 Jul 2016. According to the report, the susceptible population was 3557 head including 459 clinical cases of which 34 died, the 425 remaining sick animals \"killed and disposed of\". No stamping out applied and no additional case reported in the 12 follow-up reports, the last of which, no.12, submitted on 26 Nov 2017, stated: 1. Compensation to the animals' owners for dead cattle at the market price is being developed and will be implemented soon. All 459 diseased cattle heads were destroyed and the final disinfection was carried out. 2. The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted. Follow-up report no.12, with links to all previous reports, is available at (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=21682).  Although according to media reports vaccination was applied, no details of such were included in the 12 follow-up reports nor in Kazakhstan's semi-annual summary report to the OIE (July-December 2016), which included the epidemiological statistics above; the item \"control measures\" (against LSD) did not include \"vaccination\".  The current media report, from a Kyrgyz source (citing a Kazakh newspaper), says that during the 2016 event, 6000 animals were infected, of which 600 died. An earlier media report, from Kazakhstan, dated 27 Jul 2016, said that the number of diseased animals \"exceeded 2000, of which 50 head of cattle died\" (see archive no. http://promedmail.org/post/20160727.4374008).  Kazakhstan is the world's largest landlocked country, and the 9th largest in the world. The belated diagnosis in 2016, and its continued absence, so far, during the current event, is puzzling; following the acquiring of independence in Dec 1991, Kazakhstan obtained support from the West, particularly USA, in the establishment of state-of-the-art laboratories for research and diagnosis of infectious diseases in man and animals.  Early report on the factual circulation and distribution of LSD within Kazakhstan is anticipated. Neighboring countries may take steps to prevent its introduction; those countries include China, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. Russia is LSD-infected (last follow-up report addressing 2 new outbreaks in Saratov oblast, adjacent to West Kazakhstan, published 24 Aug 2017).  For the diagnosis of LSD, samples from clinically affected animals should preferably be derived from their typical dermal lesions; organs from dead animals which should be sent for laboratory tests are specified in OIE's Manual. The submission of \"meat of dead cows\" for testing in the laboratories, as reported, may not be ideal for timely diagnosis of LSD. - Mod.AS  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/46186).

From: a subscriber whose identity is known to ProMED, but who preferred to remain unnamed (edited)   In response to ProMED-mail's RFI's in postings http://promedmail.org/post/20170815.5251541 and http://promedmail.org/post/20170825.5274779 about lumpy skin disease in Kazakhstan:  1. It is understood that the government of Kazakhstan officially announced the presence, in 2017, of nodular dermatitis aka lumpy skin disease, LSD.  2. Russian and Kenyan LSD vaccines have been mentioned as the ones applied, and their effectiveness discussed.  3. Private owners of livestock suffer most, because the compensation for each sick cow is minimal. It is necessary to develop an effective compensation scheme for the smallholder livestock owners.  4. The following information on the 2016 LSD event in Kazakhstan was included in a report for the population, by the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic of Kazakhstan, AI Myrzahmetov, published on 2 Jun 2017: \"In 2016, 4 foci of nodular dermatitis outbreaks in cattle were reported in the Atyrau oblast. Amendments were made to the legislation and 185 million tenge (USD 551 300) were paid from the republican budget as compensation for the cost of animals that died from this disease. To date, all liquidation measures have been completed. Preventive vaccination of livestock in Atyrau oblast, as well as in 6 border areas of Aktobe Aqtobe (2) and West Kazakhstan (4) oblasts, are coming to an end.\"   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  ProMED-mail is very grateful to the submitter of the information above, addressing 4 issues raised in earlier postings on LSD in Kazakhstan.  The following comments address the issues as numbered above: 1. Additional details (link?) of the mentioned official confirmation, by Kazakhstan's authorities, of the current (2017) LSD event will be helpful. The internationally customary (in fact, required) route for such an announcement is an immediate notification to the OIE.  2. The LSD vaccine applied in Russia (and exported) is, in fact, a sheep-pox vaccine which, following a testing procedure, was recently licensed also for the vaccination of cattle against LSD (see http://promedmail.org/post/20170511.5028821).  The Kenyan O-240 vaccine has been recently found to include an LSD virus which underwent a low level of attenuation which may be not sufficient for safe use in cattle. It was suspected to cause clinical disease in vaccinated animals (see in http://promedmail.org/post/20140820.2708273).  EU countries currently use a live-homologous LSD vaccine (South-Africa's Neetling virus strain). A European Union LSD vaccine bank has become operational since April 2016. Trials assessing an inactivated vaccine were reportedly undertaken, currently in their final stages.  For a recent assessment of LSD vaccines, please see http://promedmail.org/post/20160812.4410864, including the commentary. OIE's Manual chapter on LSD, including exhaustive updated information, is available at (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.13_LSD.pdf).  3. This comment is of high significance. Small-holders, worldwide, may be slow, or even tempted to refrain altogether from reporting the appearance of early signs of a reportable animal disease, if they expect compensations to be under the real damages and payments delayed. Such animals may be (illegally) sold, with consequent spread of disease and  eventually  higher national losses and expenditures.  4. The original text, in Kazakh and Russian, is available in Kazakhstan's Ministry of Agriculture blog, at (http://tinyurl.com/ydbgtg6k). In case the recent media reports on LSD spreading in Western Kazakhstan are confirmed, it will be of interest to note if the affected farms included vaccinated animals and which vaccines were used.  Kazakhstan's official reporting on the 2016 LSD event was limited to a solitary notification on a single outbreak; no details of the vaccination (numbers and vaccinated animals, geography) were included.  According to the recent official update, LSD was recorded, during 2016, in 4 locations within the Atyrau oblast.  Timely and detailed information on the LSD situation in Kazakhstan is essential for the entire region. This applies also for another livestock disease suspected to be spreading in central Asia, namely PPR (peste des petits ruminants) in small ruminants. - Mod.AS  Maps of Kazakhstan can be seen at (https://kazakhstan.orexca.com/img/kazakhstan_map.gif) and (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/46186). - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ  ","keywordsMatched":[]},"154":{"title":"Lumpy skin disease - Europe (08): Russia (OB) bovine,\r\n\tKazakhstan (AR) susp.

Since the start, on 5 Jun 2017, of the current LSD epizootic in Russia's provinces bordering Kazakhstan (the Saratovskaya, Samarkanskaya and Orenburskaya oblasts), 36 outbreaks have been reported as of 24 Aug 2017.  According to media reports and direct information from reliable sources, LSD is, most likely, currently circulating in western regions of Kazakhstan (Atyrau, probably also Aqtobe and West Kazakhstan) without being officially confirmed or duly reported to the OIE.

Two vaccines are being applied in Kazakhstan to protect cattle against LSD: a. A Russian sheep pox vaccine (effectiveness under question) with unknown dosage; b. Neethling homologous live attenuated vaccine Lumpivax (MSD Animal Health). This vaccine is produced in South Africa.  The information on a Kenyan vaccine as being applied in Kazakhstan is not confirmed.  2. In the absence of official diagnosis of LSD, farmers will not be entitled to receive compensation. However, in Kazakhstan, they may diagnose \"pasteurellosis,\" and people will get their compensation that way. In such case, one will not know whether the actual case was related to LSD or another etiological disease agent.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. \n(promed@promedmail.org)  ProMED-mail is indebted to the submitter of the above information.  The comment on pasteurellosis (sometimes termed as hemorrhagic septicaemia), which is often a secondary infection, as a potentially substitutional diagnosis is rather concerning (see http://promedmail.org/post/20160717.4350687, http://promedmail.org/post/20160722.4362368, http://promedmail.org/post/20160723.4365082).  Kazakhstan's compliance with OIE standards, the quality of its national Veterinary Services for a timely and accurate diagnosis of suspected animal diseases, which is essential for their control, prevention and official notification; and the appropriateness of the country's veterinary legislation have been visited in the framework of OIE's PVS Pathway (see (http://www.oie.int/support-to-oie-members/pvs-pathway/)). Following visits of OIE's experts missions, comprehensive evaluation reports of the visited countries are issued, indicating and allowing required improvements or, ideally, confirming the satisfactory prevailing situations.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness\nand disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE,\nAtay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral\nrehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and\nother forms of diarrhea: \"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that\ncholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement,\nand, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not\nuntil 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of\nthe intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could\nbe effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the\nintravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could\nbe just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for\nexample, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy\n(ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the\nmorbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1)\nhighlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn\nBangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per\ncent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as\n\"potentially the most important medical advance\" of the 20th century.\nA variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice\npowder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially\nzinc (5). \"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to\napproximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those\nwith severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously\nwith a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of\n20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg\nover the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser\ndegrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or\nrice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those\nwith no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with\nfrequent reevaluation. \"References\n-\n1.

The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare is advising tourists to go to hospital if they develop a high fever or generalized rash after returning to Japan.

About 4100 patients in Italy and around 6500 patients in Romania have already been confirmed as of August 2017 compared with about 860 and 2000, respectively, throughout 2016, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.  Symptoms of the highly contagious disease include runny nose, red and watery eyes, high fever, and rash. The virus is spread through coughing and sneezing and can cause complications such as pneumonia and can even result in death in one in 1000 patients, according to the ministry. The ministry recommends people traveling overseas to check their vaccination records and take an additional shot if they have only been vaccinated once.  The disease was prevalent about a decade ago in Japan with the number of patients soaring to over 10 000 in 2008 but the country was later considered as free from infections of the virus.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Japan can be found at (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/156). - Mod.LK   <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Australia (Perth, Western Australia): ex Italy.

Large measles outbreak introduced by asylum seekers and spread among the insufficiently vaccinated resident population, Berlin, October 2014 to August 2015. Euro Surveill. 2017; 22(34): pii=30599 - Abstract  The largest measles outbreak in Berlin since 2001 occurred from October 2014 to August 2015. Overall, 1344 cases were ascertained, 86 per cent (with available information) unvaccinated, including 146 (12 per cent) asylum seekers. Median age was 17 years (interquartile range: 4-29 years), 26 per cent were hospitalised and a 1 year old child died. Measles virus genotyping uniformly revealed the variant 'D8-Rostov-Don' and descendants. The virus was likely introduced by and initially spread among asylum seekers before affecting Berlin's resident population. Among Berlin residents, the highest incidence was in children younger than 2 years, yet most cases (52 per cent) were adults. Post-exposure vaccinations in homes for asylum seekers, not always conducted, occurred later (median: 7.5 days) than the recommended 72 hours after onset of the 1st case and reached only half of potential contacts. Asylum seekers should not only have non-discriminatory, equitable access to vaccination, they also need to be offered measles vaccination in a timely fashion, that is, immediately upon arrival in the receiving country. Supplementary immunisation activities targeting the resident population, particularly adults, are urgently needed in Berlin.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail.

Source: Romania Insider (edited) (https://www.romania-insider.com/measles-kills-iraqi-refugee/)   The ongoing measles outbreak keeps making victims in Romania. A 10 month old girl, who was a refugee from Iraq, became the 33rd person to die of the infection, reports local Digi24. The girl arrived in Romania on 7 Jul 2017 with her family, and the doctors diagnosed her with measles in August. They also discovered that the child was suffering from malnutrition and severe psychomotor retardation.  The measles outbreak is still a major problem in Romania, with more than 8900 cases reported across the country until 25 Aug 2017, including 33 deaths, according to data from the National Center for Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases (CNSCBT). Most deaths were registered in Timis (9), Dolj (7), and Arad (6) counties.  Measles is a highly contagious respiratory infection caused by a virus. It causes a total-body skin rash and flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough, and runny nose. According to information posted on WHO's website, the virus is highly contagious, spreading by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact, and direct contact with infected nasal or throat secretions. Unvaccinated young children pose the highest risk of measles and its complications, including death.  The Romanian Government adopted earlier this month August 2017 a draft bill on the organization and financing of population vaccination (https://www.romania-insider.com/romania-draft-bill-vaccination/). The project was sent to the Parliament for approval and could come into force in January 2018.  byline: Irina Marica   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Measles tends to be more severe in children who are malnourished, especially children who are also vitamin A deficient. And complications are commoner and more serious in malnourished children. Because of complications such as diarrhoea, measles may lead to failure to thrive. Infection with measles virus may lead to kwashiorkor or marasmus in children who are underweight at the time that they get infected. Therefore, measles may result in, or aggravate, malnutrition.

Date: Sat 26 Aug 2017. Source: News-Medical/Life Sciences (edited) (https://www.news-medical.net/news/20170826/New-study-highlights-role-played-by-demographics-in-the-spread-of-measles.aspx)   Even if the incidence of measles infection has decreased by at least 90 per cent worldwide since the introduction of the vaccine, measles is still one of the major causes of death in children among vaccine-preventable diseases. Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world.  A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries.  Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years.  \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\"  \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea\".  The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years 2 million DALYs since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln 13 million DALYs in the US, and 36-mln 36 million DALYs in Ethiopia.  \"Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,\" continues Prof Melegaro \"our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population. Tailoring immunization campaigns to achieve measles eradication goals is essential and currently, for some countries, this means considering also the role of unprotected adolescents and young adults.\"   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Reference - Trentini F, Poletti P, Merler S, Melegaro A.

A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam;\n- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however,\nhave suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be\neffective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and\noutbreak situations (63, 64). \"References\n\n57.

The Kazakh edition of \"Ak Zhayik\" states that 120 cows died in the Isatay district of Atyrau region in the west of Kazakhstan map at (http://tinyurl.com/y9ksmu2x) in the period from 20 Jul to August 2017.  Veterinarians do not know the cause of the animal's deaths.\"Since the cattle are still in the pastures, the owners themselves bring sick animals to us. Although they do not have a high temperature, they still cannot save them,\" said veterinarian Islamgali Mardashev.  The meat of the dead cows was sent for testing in the laboratories of Astana and Almaty, but so far there are no results see comment below. It is only known that before dying the temperature of the animals rises, and there is weakness and lumps under the skin.  In the summer of 2016, the Atyrau oblast similarly suffered a massive loss of livestock; more than 800 cattle died. All of them had nodular dermatitis. More than 6000 cattle were infected with the disease.  byline: Alexandra Titova   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  From 10 to 15 Jun 2016, a disease which later was recognized as lumpy skin disease (LSD) was recorded in a cattle holding on the territory adjacent to the village of Chapayevo, West Kazakhstan (see archive no. http://promedmail.org/post/20160717.4350687; at this point in time, laymen, followed by the media, erroneously related to the undiagnosed and most probably unfamiliar new disease as foot and mouth disease. Please see relevant commentary in the subsequent postings no. http://promedmail.org/post/20160722.4362368 and http://promedmail.org/post/20160723.4365082).  On 7 Jul 2016, Kazakhstan reported (see archive no. http://promedmail.org/post/20160722.4363497) a single LSD outbreak in Makasch, Kurmangazinskiy, Mangashlak (western to Atyrau; map at (http://tinyurl.com/ycb4j9h7)), stating that it had started on 7 Jul 2016. According to the report, the susceptible population was 3557 head including 459 clinical cases of which 34 died, the 425 remaining sick animals \"killed and disposed of\". No stamping out applied and no additional case reported in the 12 follow-up reports, the last of which, no.12, submitted on 26 Nov 2017, stated: 1. Compensation to the animals' owners for dead cattle at the market price is being developed and will be implemented soon. All 459 diseased cattle heads were destroyed and the final disinfection was carried out. 2. The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted. Follow-up report no.12, with links to all previous reports, is available at (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=21682).  Although according to media reports vaccination was applied, no details of such were included in the 12 follow-up reports nor in Kazakhstan's semi-annual summary report to the OIE (July-December 2016), which included the epidemiological statistics above; the item \"control measures\" (against LSD) did not include \"vaccination\".  The current media report, from a Kyrgyz source (citing a Kazakh newspaper), says that during the 2016 event, 6000 animals were infected, of which 600 died. An earlier media report, from Kazakhstan, dated 27 Jul 2016, said that the number of diseased animals \"exceeded 2000, of which 50 head of cattle died\" (see archive no. http://promedmail.org/post/20160727.4374008).  Kazakhstan is the world's largest landlocked country, and the 9th largest in the world. The belated diagnosis in 2016, and its continued absence, so far, during the current event, is puzzling; following the acquiring of independence in Dec 1991, Kazakhstan obtained support from the West, particularly USA, in the establishment of state-of-the-art laboratories for research and diagnosis of infectious diseases in man and animals.  Early report on the factual circulation and distribution of LSD within Kazakhstan is anticipated. Neighboring countries may take steps to prevent its introduction; those countries include China, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. Russia is LSD-infected (last follow-up report addressing 2 new outbreaks in Saratov oblast, adjacent to West Kazakhstan, published 24 Aug 2017).  For the diagnosis of LSD, samples from clinically affected animals should preferably be derived from their typical dermal lesions; organs from dead animals which should be sent for laboratory tests are specified in OIE's Manual. The submission of \"meat of dead cows\" for testing in the laboratories, as reported, may not be ideal for timely diagnosis of LSD. - Mod.AS  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/46186).

This came about after 2\nkidney recipients in Taiwan were diagnosed with dengue 2 days after\nreceiving a kidney each from the same donor, said National Cheng Kung\nUniversity microbiology and immunology professor Dr Oscar Perng\nGuey-chuen. \"This indicates a potential risk,\" the Taiwan-based\nscientist said, adding that no dengue virus was detected in the\ndonor's blood. He said the donor contracted dengue in 2015 and in mid-2016, he died\nin an accident. His family donated his corneas, liver, heart, and\nkidneys. Both patients had the same strain of the dengue virus the\ndonor had in 2015 and one of the recipients died of dengue\nhaemorrhagic fever, he said. Asked where the virus could be hiding since it could not be detected\nin the blood, he said it was a question scientists are trying to\nanswer. Interestingly, those who received the donor's corneas, liver,\nand heart did not develop dengue, Dr Perng said on the sidelines of\nthe National Dengue And Arboviruses Infection Conference 2017\nyesterday 12 Aug 2017. He said although there was not enough\nevidence to show the virus came from the donor as the kidneys were not\ntested for dengue before the transplant, the same virus was found in\nthe patients' bodies after that. Dr Perng said his team had studied mice for dengue virus in the blood\ntestes, kidney, liver, spleen and brain, and found the virus present\nin the kidneys and brain. \"We believe the virus probably resided in\nthe kidneys and was not cleared by the body,\" he said, adding that the\nvirus could have been activated after transplant. He said this raised\nconcerns about asymptomatic people who are dengue carriers. Health Ministry deputy director, general Datuk Dr S Jeyaindran said\npatients with severe dengue would have better recovery if they were\ngiven colloids, a more concentrated fluid, at the early stage in fluid\nmanagement for dengue patients. Dr Jeyaindran, who was representing\nHealth Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam, said colloids may be\nintroduced at an earlier stage, instead of saline because it has not\nbeen successful in treating patients with severe dengue. He said more\nstudies will be conducted to find out at which stage the colloids\nshould be given. byline: Loh Foon Fong \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) - Air travel related spread of dengue.\nDate: Thu 3 Aug 2017.\nSource: Medical Xpress (edited)\n(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-08-air-responsible-dengue-asia.html) \nWhile the incidences of many other infectious diseases have declined\nover the past decade, the number of cases and outbreaks of dengue\nvirus have continued to increase. The spread of dengue to new areas is\nlikely due in large part to trends in air travel, researchers now\nreport in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Dengue virus affects as estimated 390 million people around the globe\neach year, and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild fever and\nheadache to severe low blood pressure. The virus has mostly caused\ndisease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, but a 2014\noutbreak in Japan broke that pattern. Overall, the geographic area\naffected by dengue has been growing in recent years. In the new work, Huaiyu Tian and Bing Xu, both of Beijing Normal\nUniversity, China, together with colleagues from the University of\nOxford and elsewhere analyzed the spread of dengue viruses in Asia\nfrom 1956 to 2015. They used 2202 genetic sequences of dengue viruses,\ncollected in 20 countries or regions of Asia over the 59 years, to\ndetermine how different strains were related. They also investigated\ntrends in air travel, maritime mobility, migration, and\nsocio-economics to determine what factors impact the spread of\ndengue. The spread of 3 different dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1, -2, and -3,\nis associated with air traffic more so than any other factors, the\ndata revealed. Air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India, the\nresearchers found, help seed dengue epidemics, while China, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, and Singapore help diffuse the virus to other Asian\ncountries. \"Future trends in global mobility could potentially accelerate the\nappearance and diffusion of DENV worldwide,\" the researchers say.\n\"Prevention and control of dengue epidemics requires a better\nunderstanding of its mode of geographic dissemination, especially for\ncountries in the tropics.\" Reference: Tian H, Sun Z, Faria NR, et al.

Five districts in 3 governorates are now infected.  The total number of cVDPV2 cases is 33 (this includes the previously reported 29 cases from Mayadeen district, Deir ez-Zor governorate, and 1 case from Tell Abyad district, Raqqa governorate). All confirmed cases to date have had onset of paralysis before 11 Jul 2017.  Final lab results for an additional 9 poliovirus type-2 (PV2) isolates from Deir ez-Zor are pending.  Discussions around expanding the scope of the immunization response to include accessible areas of a Tadmour sub-district in Homs, bordering Deir ez-Zor , will be held in light of the confirmation of the cases in this area.  Raqqa governorate commenced its 1st immunization round on 12 Aug 2017 (Raqqa and Thawra districts) and 13 Aug 2017 (Tell Abyad district). The immunization round aims to reach 120 000 children under 5 years of age. Preliminary information suggests the rounds are reaching children in all 3 districts.  Preparations continue for the 2nd round in Deir ez-Zor governorate, scheduled for 19-23 Aug 2017. IPV inactivated polio vaccine for use in the 2nd rounds in Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa governorates has arrived in Damascus.  The total number of AFP acute flaccid paralysis cases detected in Deir ez-Zor governorate since the beginning of 2017 is 113 (83 from Mayadeen, 11 from Deir ez-Zor, and 19 from Boukamal districts). Raqqa governorate has reported 16 AFP cases (5 from Raqqa, 10 from Tell Abyad, and 1 from Thawra districts). Homs governorate has reported 26 AFP cases (11 from Homs city, 12 from Rastan, 1 from Tadmour, and 2 from Talkalakh districts).  The Eradication and Outbreak Management Group (EOMG) has approved the release of additional doses of IPV to cover high risk population groups in northwest Syria, Turkey, and Lebanon. Lebanon requested 144 000 doses and has begun to implement IPV campaigns across the country.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Unfortunately transmission of the cVDPV2 in Syria has continued. With each report, the date of onset of the most recent case shifts to a date approximately one month preceding the report, probably reflecting the time it takes from specimen collection to appropriate reference laboratory. We are fairly sure there will be an additional 9 cases confirmed from Deir ez-Zor, as the report above mentions that there are 9 poliovirus isolates pending typing (WPV vs cVDPV). The report also mentions a significant number of AFP cases identified in the 3 governorates, suggesting there may be more cases in the pipeline for confirmation. The control activities have been implemented during this week and will be implemented in additional areas next week week of 21 Aug 2017, so hopefully there will be interruption of transmission going forward.  The disturbing news in the situation report above, is that there is now involvement of 3 governorates. Deir ez-Zor, Raqqa, and now Homs. On a map of Syria showing provinces/governorates ((http://www.freeworldmaps.net/asia/syria/syria-political-map.jpg)), one can see that Deir ez-Zor, the main governorate involved in this outbreak is located in the northeast of the country sharing it's eastern border with Iraq. It shares a southern border with Homs, and a western border with Raqqa (Ar-Raqqah on this map) governorate. Hopefully the cVDPV2 will not continue to travel in the country outside of the currently 3 affected areas. - Mod.MPP   <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Somalia: declared polio free. Date: Mon 14 Aug 2017. Source: AllAfrica, Shabelle Media Network (Mogadishu) report (edited) (http://allafrica.com/stories/201708150227.html)   The UN World Health Organisation (WHO) said it had not recorded any case of polio disease in Somalia in the last 3 years, declaring the country polio free.  The WHO said the country recorded the last case of polio in 2014 in the central part of the country but has since then remained free of the paralyzing disease.  The UN health agency, however, warned Somalia remained vulnerable, calling for continued vaccination campaign, Xinhua News Agency reported.  The head of the WHO Eastern Mediterranean, which covers Somalia, Mohamed Fiqi said that massive vaccination campaigns and commitment from government and international actors had ensured the polio virus did not recur in the Horn of Africa country.  \"As the world edges closer to eradicating polio, keeping alert in countries that have high risk of polio importation like Somalia is more of priority than ever,\" Fiqi said.  \"As we move forward, the polio programme in Somalia needs to continue to work to maintain and improve the level of population immunity against polio through target vaccination campaign and strengthening of the routine immunisation services and infrastructure,\" Fiqi added.  The declaration by WHO keeps Somalia outside the last group of countries which still record cases of polio in the world.  Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan are the remaining countries where polio is still being recorded. The WHO chief warned Somalia remains at risk of importation of the virus from these countries.  Somalia President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo praised efforts to rid his country of the polio disease which he noted had subjected many children into suffering.  \"No cases were found for the past 3 years and no child was affected by this disease. Many of our children have suffered from polio for many years.  \"To eradicate polio was a big success and it was collective effort and commitment by many young men and women who sacrificed their lives,\" Farmaajo noted.  The 3 year polio-free celebration comes amidst the worst outbreak of measles the country has seen in years.  Somalia is also still responding to an outbreak of acute watery diarrhoea/cholera, which began in January 2017. Polio systems and networks are being used in both interventions.  \"Polio infrastructure has been critical in responding to these other serious outbreaks,\" said Fiqi.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  Achieving 3 years with no new cases of polio reported is a significant achievement for Somalia. That being said, it's important to remember that this too is a country with internal civil strife and warring factions, which may impede the identification of poliovirus associated disease either due to infrastructural challenges in good specimen collection and transport, or access of the population to the healthcare infrastructure. A reminder is the identification of WPV associated cases in Borno, Nigeria last year (2016), involving a virus last seen 5 years before in the same state.

We continue to work together to advance shared priorities, including governance and democracy, regional security, poverty reduction, polio eradication, trade, defense, and the fight against climate change.\"  - The 14th Emergency Committee for polio eradication under the International Health Regulations met on 3 Aug 2017 and has made its recommendations to the WHO Director-General, who has accepted them. The Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and recommended the extension of revised Temporary Recommendations for a further 3 months. The key change is the inclusion of DR Congo and Syria in the category 'States infected with cVDPV2s, with potential risk of international spread'.  - Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: Afghanistan: 1 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case; Pakistan: 1 new WPV1-positive environmental sample; Syrian Arab Republic: 3 new circulating vaccine-derived polio type 2 (cVDPV2) from Syria, 2 from Deir ez-Zor and 1 from Homs governorates. Details in country-specific sections below.  Afghanistan  - One new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week, bringing the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 to 6. It is the most recent case in the country, and had onset of paralysis on 10 Jul 2017, from Zabul province, neighbouring Kandahar province and Pakistan. - Afghanistan continues to coordinate activities with neighbouring Pakistan, to address both cross-border transmission and focus on reaching mobile populations with oral polio vaccine (OPV). Transmission linking both countries runs primarily across 3 corridors, namely: eastern Afghanistan and Khyber-Peshawar, Pakistan; greater Kandahar/Helmand and Quetta, Pakistan; and, Paktika/Patkya/Khost and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa/Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Pakistan.  Pakistan  - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week; the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 3. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 11 Jun 2017, from Killa Abdullah, Balochistan. - 1 new WPV1-positive environmental sample was reported in the past week, collected on 28 Jul 2017, from Quetta, Balochistan. - A special vaccination round is being implemented during August 2017 targeting areas with recent polio cases and positive environmental samples. These include Rawalpindi/Islamabad and demographically connected areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Quetta Block, and parts of Karachi. - Under the National Emergency Action Plan for polio eradication, the country is planning to implement 2 nation-wide and 2 sub-national vaccination rounds from September to December 2017.  Nigeria - - No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 21 Aug 2016 in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno. - Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016). - Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance.  Lake Chad Basin  - The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno, Nigeria in 2016) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) (Borno and Sokoto provinces in Nigeria in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak. - Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.  Central Africa  - No new cases of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). The total number of cVDPV2 cases this year 2017 remains 7, in 2 separate outbreaks: in Haut Lomami province (5 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on 13 Jun 2017); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on 26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017, with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May 2017). - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time. Outbreak response is taking place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols, targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 across the 2 provinces. - The 1st mOPV2 round was implemented on 27-29 Jun 2017 in the 2 affected provinces; and the 2nd mOPV2 round ran from 13-15 Jul 2017 in Haut Lomami and 20-22 Jul 2017 in Maniema. - Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.  Middle East  - In Syria, 3 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were officially reported in the past week. The total number of cases in this outbreak is 33. Onset of paralysis of these cases is between 3 Mar 2017 and 10 Jul 2017. 31 of the cases are from Deir ez-Zor governorate (29 from Mayadeen district, one from Deir ez-Zor district, and one from Boukamal district); 1 case is from Talabyad district, Raqqa governorate; and, 1 is from Tadmour district in Homs governorate. - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized and implemented, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Two vaccination campaigns are planned for both Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa governorates. If there is geographic spread, the extent of these campaigns will have to be adjusted. - The 1st mOPV2 round in Deir ez-Zor was successfully carried out between 22-26 Jul 2017. Independent post-campaign monitoring reflected coverage of 88.4 percent (based on caregiver recall). The 2nd round is planned for 19-23 Aug 2017, and will include mOPV2 and IPV. - Raqqa Governorate started mOPV2 campaigns on 12 Aug 2017. - Plans are being finalized to mitigate the risks of further spread from the outbreak zone to neighbouring areas and countries, including immunization of at-risk populations in northwest Syria, Turkey and Lebanon. Following confirmation of the case in Homs, discussions are ongoing to further extend the geographic reach of the outbreak response.

(promed@promedmail.org)  This week's global update is similar to prior weeks in terms of low level identification of WPV1 associated disease (a single case confirmed in Afghanistan this past week), one positive WPV1 isolated from an environmental sample in Pakistan, and 3 newly confirmed cVDPV2 associated cases in Syria.  That being said, there have only been 9 confirmed cases of WPV1 associated paralytic disease worldwide this year (2017), compared with 37 cases reported last year (2016). In contrast there have been 40 confirmed cases of cVDPV2 confirmed this year (2017) compared with 5 last year (2016). As a reminder, outbreaks due to cVDPV's are considered as significant in the big picture of polio eradication, as they are due to vaccine polioviruses that have reverted in neurovirulence following passage through multiple individuals while circulating in the susceptible population. The goal of the polio eradication initiative is to interrupt transmission of both the WPV's and the cVDPVs. The presence of cVDPVs occurs when there are areas with low vaccination coverage where the vaccine virus (from the OPV) can continue circulating through the susceptible population.

NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in\npress): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons,\nvaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside\nof Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as\n60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection\nlengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:\n- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam;\n- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses.

In Kucha Kharasian in Haveli Mian\nKhan it is said 4 persons were taken ill at about noon and died the\nsame day. The next day, 5 persons were taken ill of the same disease.\nIt is, of course, impossible for laymen to make out whether all these\ncases were of cholera, but the nature of the deaths would seem to\nsuggest the urgent need of effective action. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) Maps of Pakistan can be seen at\n(http://www.mapsofworld.com/pakistan/pakistan-political-map.html) and\n(http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2128). - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ Aggressive interventions to stem outbreaks of cholera include\nproviding sources of clean water and a vaccination campaign. The\nfollowing is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In:\nChronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract.\nGreydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in\npress): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons,\nvaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside\nof Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as\n60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection\nlengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:\n- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam;\n- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however,\nhave suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be\neffective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and\noutbreak situations (63, 64). \"References\n\n57.

Raúl Pinales Sarabia, coordinator of Sanitary Jurisdiction number IV,\nwhich includes the municipalities of Francisco R Murguía (Nieves);\nJuan Aldama, Miguel Auza, Cañitas de Felipe Pescador, and Rio Grande,\nreported that for the time being, 19 cases of brucellosis have been\ndetected in these 5 municipalities. He explained that there are 3\ncases registered in the municipality of Francisco R Murguía, 3 cases\nin the municipality of Juan Aldama, 3 more in Cañitas de Felipe\nPescador, 4 in Miguel Auza, and 6 in the municipality of Rio Grande. He explained that the departments of both epidemiology and sanitary\nregulation are responsible for dealing with this type of cases: \"It is\nthe responsibility of sanitary regulation to carry out the sampling of\nproducts, especially goats' cheese and thus verify that they are free\nof this disease, and the department of epidemiology performs the\nsampling for confirmatory tests at the state level, which is why there\nare 19 cases already confirmed.\" He also pointed out that once these cases are confirmed, medical\ntreatment is started, which consists of streptomycin and tetracycline\nadministered for 21 days. \"This disease, like many others, is serious\nif left untreated. After 21 days we wait a month before we do another\nsampling and send it back to the state laboratory to confirm that the\npatients are free of the disease; if not treatment continues until the\nperson is healthy,\" he said. Finally he said that people should be very careful when consuming goat\ncheeses and people who work and live with sheep and goats should do so\nwith the care that this entails, to avoid being infected by\nbrucellosis. byline: Iván Márquez \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-ESP\n(promed-esp@promedmail.org) Brucellosis is a disease that is thought to have existed since\nancient times, as it was first described over 2000 years ago by the\nRomans and Hippocrates. It was not until 1887 that a British\nphysician, Dr David Bruce, isolated the organism that causes\nbrucellosis from several deceased patients from the island of Malta.\nThis disease has had several names throughout its history, including\nMediterranean fever, Malta fever, Crimean fever, Bang's disease, and\nundulant fever (because of the relapsing nature of the fever\nassociated with the disease). See\n(http://www.medicinenet.com/brucellosis/article.htm). The symptoms and signs of brucellosis may develop from days to months\nafter the initial exposure to the organism. While some individuals may\ndevelop mild symptoms, others may go on to develop long-term chronic\nsymptoms. The signs and symptoms of brucellosis are extensive, and\nthey can be similar to many other febrile illnesses, so recognition of\npotential exposure from ingestion of unpasteurized milk or cheese,\nworking in a slaughter house or meat processing plant, or working in a\nmicrobiology lab is critical information when evaluating a case. The post does not state if the diagnoses were made by culture or by\nserology. A previous post in March 2017 reported only 5 cases. It is\nnot clear over what period the 19 cases occurred.

Update: Interim guidance\nfor health care providers caring for pregnant women with possible Zika\nvirus exposure  United States (including US Territories), July 2017.\nMMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2017; 66(29): 781-93. doi:\n10.15585/mmwr.mm6629e1\n-\nCDC has updated the interim guidance for US health care providers\ncaring for pregnant women with possible Zika virus exposure in\nresponse to 1) declining prevalence of Zika virus disease in the World\nHealth Organization's Region of the Americas (Americas) and 2)\nemerging evidence indicating prolonged detection of Zika virus\nimmunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies. Zika virus cases were 1st reported\nin the Americas during 2015-2016; however, the incidence of Zika virus\ndisease has since declined. As the prevalence of Zika virus disease\ndeclines, the likelihood of false-positive test results increases. In\naddition, emerging epidemiologic and laboratory data indicate that, as\nis the case with other flaviviruses, Zika virus IgM antibodies can\npersist beyond 12 weeks after infection. Therefore, IgM test results\ncannot always reliably distinguish between an infection that occurred\nduring the current pregnancy and one that occurred before the current\npregnancy, particularly for women with possible Zika virus exposure\nbefore the current pregnancy. These limitations should be considered\nwhen counseling pregnant women about the risks and benefits of testing\nfor Zika virus infection during pregnancy. This updated guidance\nemphasizes a shared decision-making model for testing and screening\npregnant women, one in which patients and providers work together to\nmake decisions about testing and care plans based on patient\npreferences and values, clinical judgment, and a balanced assessment\nof risks and expected outcomes. For these recommendations, the definition of possible Zika virus\nexposure has not changed and includes travel to, or residence in an\narea with risk for mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission or sex with\na partner who has traveled to or resides in an area with risk for\nmosquito-borne Zika virus transmission. These areas can be found on\nthe CDC \"Zika Travel Information\" webpage. Key recommendations include the following:\n1- All pregnant women in the United States and US territories should\nbe asked about possible Zika virus exposure before and during the\ncurrent pregnancy, at every prenatal care visit. CDC recommends that\npregnant women not travel to any area with risk for Zika virus\ntransmission. It is also recommended that pregnant women with a sex\npartner who has traveled to or lives in an area with risk for Zika\nvirus transmission use condoms or abstain from sex for the duration of\nthe pregnancy.\n2- Pregnant women with recent possible Zika virus exposure and\nsymptoms of Zika virus disease should be tested to diagnose the cause\nof their symptoms. The updated recommendations include concurrent Zika\nvirus nucleic acid test (NAT) and serologic testing as soon as\npossible through 12 weeks after symptom onset.\n3- Asymptomatic pregnant women with ongoing possible Zika virus\nexposure should be offered Zika virus NAT testing 3 times during\npregnancy. IgM testing is no longer routinely recommended because IgM\ncan persist for months after infection; therefore, IgM results cannot\nreliably determine whether an infection occurred during the current\npregnancy. The optimal timing and frequency of testing of asymptomatic\npregnant women with NAT alone is unknown. For pregnant women who have\nreceived a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection (by\neither NAT or serology positive/equivocal Zika virus or dengue virus\nIgM and Zika virus plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) 10 and\nhigher and dengue virus PRNT less than 10 results) any time before or\nduring the current pregnancy, additional Zika virus testing is not\nrecommended. For pregnant women without a prior laboratory-confirmed\ndiagnosis of Zika virus, NAT testing should be offered at the\ninitiation of prenatal care, and if Zika virus RNA is not detected on\nclinical specimens, 2 additional tests should be offered during the\ncourse of the pregnancy coinciding with prenatal visits.\n4- Asymptomatic pregnant women who have recent possible Zika virus\nexposure (that is, through travel or sexual exposure) but without\nongoing possible exposure are not routinely recommended to have Zika\nvirus testing. Testing should be considered using a shared\npatient-provider decision-making model, one in which patients and\nproviders work together to make decisions about testing and care plans\nbased on patient preferences and values, clinical judgment, a balanced\nassessment of risks and expected outcomes, and the jurisdiction's\nrecommendations. Based on the epidemiology of Zika virus transmission\nand other epidemiologic considerations (such as, seasonality),\njurisdictions might recommend testing of asymptomatic pregnant women,\neither for clinical care or as part of Zika virus surveillance. With\nthe decline in the prevalence of Zika virus disease, the updated\nrecommendations for the evaluation and testing of pregnant women with\nrecent possible Zika virus exposure but without ongoing possible\nexposure are now the same for all areas with any risk for Zika virus\ntransmission.\n5- Pregnant women who have recent possible Zika virus exposure and who\nhave a fetus with prenatal ultrasound findings consistent with\ncongenital Zika virus syndrome should receive Zika virus testing to\nassist in establishing the etiology of the birth defects. Testing\nshould include both NAT and IgM tests.\n6- The comprehensive approach to testing placental and fetal tissues\nhas been updated. Testing placental and fetal tissue specimens can be\nperformed for diagnostic purposes in certain scenarios (e.g., women\nwithout a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection and\nwho have a fetus or infant with possible Zika virus-associated birth\ndefects). However, testing of placental tissues for Zika virus\ninfection is not routinely recommended for asymptomatic pregnant women\nwho have recent possible Zika virus exposure but without ongoing\npossible exposure and who have a live born infant without evidence of\npossible Zika virus-associated birth defects.\n7- Zika virus IgM testing as part of preconception counseling to\nestablish baseline IgM results for non pregnant women with ongoing\npossible Zika virus exposure is not warranted because Zika virus IgM\ntesting is no longer routinely recommended for asymptomatic pregnant\nwomen with ongoing possible Zika virus exposure. also at the source URL above:\nAdditional interim guidance:\n- Laboratory testing of pregnant women with exposure to areas with\nrisk for Zika virus transmission\n- Prenatal management of pregnant women with laboratory evidence of\npossible Zika virus infection\n- Evaluation of placental and fetal tissue specimens for Zika virus\ninfection \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org)\nand\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be)(promed@promedmail.org) Readers interested in accessing the full report can find it at the\nsource URL above.

To evaluate the rates of acute ZIKV infection among\npatients hospitalized with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS),\nmeningoencephalitis, or transverse myelitis.\nDesign, setting, and participants. A prospective, observational cohort\nstudy was conducted at a tertiary referral center for neurological\ndiseases in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between 5 Dec 2015-10 May 2016,\namong consecutive hospitalized adults (older than 18 years of age)\nwith new-onset acute parainfectious or neuroinflammatory disease. All\nparticipants were tested for a series of arbovirosis. 3-month\nfunctional outcome was assessed.\nInterventions. Samples of serum and cerebrospinal fluid were tested\nfor ZIKV using real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain\nreaction and an IgM antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent\nassay. Clinical, radiographic (magnetic resonance imaging),\nelectrophysiological, and 3-month functional outcome data were\ncollected.\nMain outcomes and measures. The detection of neurologic complications\nsecondary to ZIKV infection.\nResults. 40 patients (15 women and 25 men; median age, 44 years\nrange, 22-72 years) were enrolled, including 29 patients (73\npercent) with GBS (90 percent Brighton level 1 certainty), 7 (18\npercent) with encephalitis, 3 (8 percent) with transverse myelitis,\nand 1 (3 percent) with newly diagnosed chronic inflammatory\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy. Of these, 35 patients (88 percent) had\nmolecular and/or serologic evidence of recent ZIKV infection in the\nserum and/or cerebrospinal fluid. Of the patients positive for ZIKV\ninfection, 27 had GBS (18 demyelinating, 8 axonal, and 1 Miller Fisher\nsyndrome), 5 had encephalitis (3 with concomitant acute neuromuscular\ndisease), 2 had transverse myelitis, and 1 had chronic inflammatory\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy. Admission to the intensive care unit was\nrequired for 9 patients positive for ZIKV infection (26 percent), and\n5 (14 percent) required mechanical ventilation. Compared with\nadmission during the period from 5 Dec 2013 - 10 May 2014 (before the\nBrazilian outbreak of ZIKV), admissions for GBS increased from a mean\nof 1.0 per month to 5.6 per month, admissions for encephalitis\nincreased from 0.4 per month to 1.4 per month, and admissions for\ntransverse myelitis remained constant at 0.6 per month. At 3 months, 2\npatients positive for ZIKV infection (6 percent) died (1 with GBS and\n1 with encephalitis), 18 (51 percent) had chronic pain, and the median\nmodified Rankin score among survivors was 2 (range, 0-5).\nConclusions and relevance. In this single-center Brazilian cohort,\nZIKV infection was associated with an increase in the incidence of a\ndiverse spectrum of serious neurologic syndromes. The data also\nsuggest that serologic and molecular testing using blood and\ncerebrospinal fluid samples can serve as a less expensive, alternative\ndiagnostic strategy in developing countries, where plaque reduction\nneutralization testing is impractical. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) This study illustrates the need to consider post-Zika virus infection\nas a cause of a variety of neurological diseases.

We found that ZIKV\npersistently infects brain endothelial cells that normally protect\nneurons from viral exposure. hBMECs are not damaged by ZIKV infection\nand, analogous to persistent HCV infection, ZIKV constitutively\ninduces and evades antiviral ISG IFN-stimulated genes and IFN\ninterferon responses to continuously replicate in hBMECs.

Consistent with the spread of ZIKV into neuronal\ncompartments, ZIKV was released basolaterally from hBMECs.

PLoS\nPathog. 2017; 13(8): e1006487. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006487\n-\nAbstract\n\nStudies have demonstrated cross-reactivity of anti-dengue virus (DENV)\nantibodies in human sera against Zika virus (ZIKV), promoting\nincreased ZIKV infection in vitro. However, the correlation between in\nvitro and in vivo findings is not well characterized. Thus, we\nevaluated the impact of heterotypic flavivirus immunity on ZIKV titers\nin biofluids of rhesus macaques. Animals previously infected (420 days\nor longer) with DENV2, DENV4, or yellow fever virus were compared to\nflavivirus-naïve animals following infection with a Brazilian ZIKV\nstrain. Sera from DENV-immune macaques demonstrated cross-reactivity\nwith ZIKV by antibody-binding and neutralization assays prior to ZIKV\ninfection, and promoted increased ZIKV infection in cell culture\nassays. Despite these findings, no significant differences between\nflavivirus-naïve and immune animals were observed in viral titers,\nneutralizing antibody levels, or immune cell kinetics following ZIKV\ninfection. These results indicate that prior infection with\nheterologous flaviviruses neither conferred protection nor increased\nobserved ZIKV titers in this non-human primate ZIKV infection model. Author summary\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne, emerging flavivirus. In\naddition to asymptomatic or mild febrile manifestations, ZIKV\ninfection in humans is associated with comparatively rare congenital\nand neurological abnormalities. Previous in vitro studies have\ndemonstrated cross-reactivity of antibodies derived from dengue virus\ninfections with ZIKV, as well as antibody-mediated enhancement of\ninfection in cell culture. Therefore, there is concern among\nvaccinologists and the public health community that the more severe\ndisease manifestations could result from prior immunity, either from\nnatural infection or vaccination, to antigenically-related\nflaviviruses (such as, dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis).\nIn this study, we evaluated the impact of prior immunity to dengue or\nyellow fever virus on ZIKV infection in a non-human primate model.\nAfter confirming that our immune cohorts were capable of\nrecapitulating the published in vitro observations of cross-reactivity\nand enhancement, we looked for alteration of viral titers in\nperipheral blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, and vaginal\nsecretions, as well as alterations in gross pathology, clinical\nparameters, and immune response, as compared to our flavivirus-naïve\ncohort. Importantly, no significant differences between\nflavivirus-naïve and primed animals were observed in viral titers or\nbiofluid distribution, neutralizing antibody levels, or immune cell\nkinetics following ZIKV infection. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org)\nand\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be)(promed@promedmail.org) Previous dengue infection, whether acquired naturally or antibody\nelicited by vaccines, has been a concern due to the possibility of\nantibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) with more severe disease. This\nconcern also relates to Zika virus antibody from vaccination for\nenhancement of dengue virus infections with resulting more severe\ndisease. The monkey studies reported above indicated that this may not\nbe a problem for Zika virus vaccinated individuals. Another effort to\navoid ADE is development of a vaccine that has epitopes specific for\nZika virus that are not shared by other flaviviruses.

ZIKV is also transmitted by\nsexual contact, although the relative importance of sexual\ntransmission is unclear. To better understand the role of sexual\ntransmission in ZIKV pathogenesis, a nonhuman primate (NHP) model of\nvaginal transmission was developed. ZIKV was readily transmitted to\nmature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by vaginal inoculation was\nreadily transmitted to mature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by\nvaginal individual RM with 1-5 vaginal inoculations required to\nestablish infection. After treatment with Depoprovera, a widely used\ncontraceptive progestin, 2 RM that initially resisted 8 vaginal ZIKV\ninoculations became infected after one ZIKV inoculation. Thus,\nDepoprovera seemed to enhance susceptibility to vaginal ZIKV\ntransmission. Unexpectedly, the kinetics of virus replication and\ndissemination after intravaginal ZIKV inoculation were markedly\ndifferent from RM infected with ZIKV by subcutaneous (SQ) virus\ninoculation. Several groups have reported that after SQ ZIKV\ninoculation vRNA is rapidly detected in blood plasma with vRNA less\ncommon in urine and saliva and only rarely detected in female\nreproductive tract (FRT) secretions. In contrast, in vaginally\ninoculated RM, plasma vRNA is delayed for several days and ZIKV\nreplication in, and vRNA shedding from, the FRT was found in all 6\nanimals. Further, after intravaginal transmission ZIKV RNA shedding\nfrom FRT secretions was detected before or simultaneously with plasma\nvRNA, and persisted for at least as long. Thus, ZIKV replication in\nthe FRT was independent of, and often preceded virus replication in\nthe tissues contributing to plasma vRNA. These results support the\nconclusion that ZIKV preferentially replicates in the FRT after\nvaginal transmission, but not after SQ transmission, and raise the\npossibility that there is enhanced fetal infection and pathology after\nvaginal ZIKV transmission compared to a mosquito transmitted ZIKV. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{10}</strong> _Aedes albopictus_ populations as vectors.\nDate: 2 Aug 2017.\nSource: American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (edited)\n(http://www.ajtmh.org/content/journals/10.4269/ajtmh.16-0969) \nref: Azar SR, Roundy CM, Rossi SL, et al.

Positive saliva samples were assayed for\ninfectious titer. Although all 3 mosquito populations were susceptible\nto all ZIKV strains, rates of infection, dissemination, and\ntransmission differed among mosquito and virus strains. _Aedes\nalbopictus_ from Salvador, Brazil, were the least efficient vectors,\ndemonstrating susceptibility to infection to 2 American strains of\nZIKV but failing to shed virus in saliva. Mosquitoes from the Rio\nGrande Valley were the most efficient vectors and were capable of\nshedding all 3 tested ZIKV strains into saliva after 14 days of\nextrinsic incubation. In particular, ZIKV strain DakAR 41525 (Senegal\n1954) was significantly more efficient at dissemination and saliva\ndeposition than the others tested in Rio Grande mosquitoes.

Emerg Microbes\nInfect. 2017; 6(8): e69. doi: 10.1038/emi.2017.59\n-\nAbstract\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has recently been associated\nwith an increased incidence of neonatal microcephaly and other\nneurological disorders. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito\nbite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some\ncases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main\nvector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other\nmosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the\nvirus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit\nZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of\nlaboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_.\nInterestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the\nmidgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in\nRecife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially\nfed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced.\nCollectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range\nof ZIKV vectors than anticipated. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be) Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active\nvirus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their\nability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step\ntoward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_\nfed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in\nsaliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing.\nThe study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a\ncompetent vector. Several other studies have shown this species to be\ninefficient vectors or refractory to Zika virus infection. One wonders\nif the specific _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ used or the Zika virus isolates\nwith which they were tested could account for these very different\nresults. Resolving these discrepancies is important because this\nmosquito species is very widely distributed around the world and bears\ndirectly on risk of outbreaks in geographic areas where _Aedes\naegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_ , Zika virus vectors, do not occur. -\nMod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"136":{"title":"Zika virus (17): Americas, research, observations ","date":["24","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Zika virus (17): Americas, research, observations [EXTERNAL]","summary":"\nZIKA VIRUS (16): AMERICAS, RESEARCH, OBSERVATIONS\n*\nA ProMED-mail post\n(http://www.promedmail.org)\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n(http://www.isid.org) In this update:\n<br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Cases in various countries: Americas\n\nAmericas cumulative case numbers Cases in various countries not mentioned above or more recent case\nnumbers.

The recent outbreaks of ZIKV in Brazil and French\nPolynesia have been linked to a considerable increase in the incidence\nof fetal microcephaly and other diseases such as Guillain-Barre\nsyndrome. Because there is currently no specific therapy or vaccine,\nthe early exploitation of a method to prevent expansion of ZIKV is a\nhigh priority. To validate commonly used antiviral drugs, we evaluated\nthe effect of ribavirin, a drug used to treat hepatitis C with\ninterferon-beta (IFN-beta), on ZIKV replication. In mammalian cells,\nwe observed an inhibitory effect of ribavirin on ZIKV replication and\nZIKV-induced cell death without cytotoxic effect. Furthermore, we\nfound that STAT1-deficient mice, which lack type I IFN signaling, were\nhighly sensitive to ZIKV infection and exhibited lethal outcome.\nRibavirin abrogated viremia in ZIKV-infected STAT-1-deficient mice.\nThese data suggest that the inhibition of viral RNA-dependent RNA\npolymerases may be effective for treatment of ZIKV infection. Our data\nprovide a new insight into the mechanisms for inhibition of ZIKV\nreplication and prevention of Zika fever. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) It will be interesting to see if these encouraging results showing\ninhibition of Zika virus replication can be replicated in non-human\nprimates. The challenge for use of drugs to inhibit Zika virus\ninfection in humans is that most (around 80 percent) Zika virus\ninfections are asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms. These\nindividuals will probably not seek medical treatment, even though\ntheir fetuses are at risk of infection with teratogenic effects. -\nMod.TY \n<br><br><strong>{3}</strong> Zika virus skewed immunosuppression.\nDate: Mon 21 Aug 2017.\nSource: Nature Microbiology journal (edited)\n(http://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-017-0016-3) \nref: Foo SS, Chen W, Chan Y, et al.

Nat Microbiol. 2017. doi: 10.1038/s41564-017-0016-3\n-\nAbstract\nBlood CD14+ monocytes are frontline immunomodulators categorized into\nclassical, intermediate or non-classical subsets, and subsequently\ndifferentiated into M1 pro- or M2 anti-inflammatory macrophages on\nstimulation. Although the Zika virus (ZIKV) rapidly establishes\nviraemia, the target cells and immune responses, particularly during\npregnancy, remain elusive. Furthermore, it is unknown whether African-\nand Asian-lineage ZIKV have different phenotypic impacts on host\nimmune responses. Using human blood infection, we identified CD14+\nmonocytes as the primary target for African- or Asian-lineage ZIKV\ninfection. When immunoprofiles of human blood infected with ZIKV were\ncompared, a classical/intermediate monocyte-mediated M1-skewed\ninflammation by the African-lineage ZIKV infection was observed, in\ncontrast to a non-classical monocyte-mediated M2-skewed\nimmunosuppression by the Asian-lineage ZIKV infection. Importantly,\ninfection of the blood of pregnant women revealed an enhanced\nsusceptibility to ZIKV infection. Specifically, Asian-lineage ZIKV\ninfection of pregnant women's blood led to an exacerbated M2-skewed\nimmunosuppression of non-classical monocytes in conjunction with a\nglobal suppression of type I interferon-signaling pathway and an\naberrant expression of host genes associated with pregnancy\ncomplications. Also, 30 ZIKV+ sera from symptomatic pregnant patients\nshowed elevated levels of M2-skewed immunosuppressive cytokines and\npregnancy-complication-associated fibronectin-1. This study\ndemonstrates the differential immunomodulatory responses of blood\nmonocytes, particularly during pregnancy, on infection with different\nlineages of ZIKV. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{4}</strong> Virus alters mosquito genes.\nDate: Tue 22 Aug 2017.\nSource: bioRxiv journal (edited)\n(http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/22/179416) \nref: Etebari K, Hegde S, Saldana MA, et al. Global transcriptome\nanalysis of _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes in response to Zika virus\ninfection. bioRxiv 179416; doi:10.1101/179416\n-\nZika virus (ZIKV) of the Flaviviridae family is a recently emerged\nmosquito-borne virus that has been implicated in the surge of the\nnumber of microcephaly instances in South America. The recent rapid\nspread of the virus led to its declaration as a global health\nemergency by the World Health Organization. The virus is transmitted\nmainly by the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_ that also vectors dengue virus,\nhowever little is known about the interactions of the virus with the\nmosquito vector. In this study, we investigated the transcriptome\nprofiles of whole _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes in response to ZIKV\ninfection at 2, 7, and 14 days post-infection using RNA-Seq. Results\nshowed changes in the abundance of a large number of transcripts at\neach time point following infection, with 18 transcripts commonly\nchanged among the 3 time points. Gene ontology analysis revealed that\nmost of the altered genes are involved in metabolic process, cellular\nprocess and proteolysis. In addition, 486 long intergenic non-coding\nRNAs were identified altered upon ZIKV infection. Further, we found\ncorrelational changes of a number of potential mRNA target genes with\nthat of altered host microRNAs. The outcomes provide a basic\nunderstanding of _Ae. aegypti_ responses to ZIKV and helps to\ndetermine host factors involved in replication or mosquito host\nanti-viral response against the virus. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) Mosquito vector competence depends on the relationship of virus and\nthe mosquito, and the defenses that the mosquito can mobilize against\nthe virus infection. Studies, such as the one above, can document the\nchanges that occur when the virus infects the mosquito, and if\ndifferences in relative vector efficiency of different geographic\nstrains of this mosquito might be related to alternations in mosquito\ngenes when infected.

To investigate the effects of Zika\nvirus infection on semen and clearance of Zika virus from semen and\nbody fluids, we aimed to study a cohort of Zika virus-infected men. Methods\nThis prospective observational study recruited men presenting with\nacute Zika virus infection at Pointe-Ã -Pitre University Hospital in\nGuadeloupe, French Caribbean, where a Zika virus outbreak occurred\nbetween April and November, 2016. Blood, urine, and semen were\ncollected at days 7, 11, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 after symptom onset,\nand semen characteristics, such as total sperm count, sperm motility,\nvitality, and morphology, and reproductive hormone concentrations,\nsuch as testosterone, inhibin, follicle-stimulating hormone, and\nluteinising hormone, were assessed. At days 7, 11, and 20, semen was\nprocessed to isolate motile spermatozoa. Zika virus RNA was detected\nby RT-PCR using whole blood, serum, urine, seminal plasma, semen\ncells, and motile spermatozoa fractions. Zika virus was isolated from\ndifferent sperm fractions on Vero E6 cultures. Findings\n15 male volunteers (mean age 35 years SD 5; range 25-44) with acute\nZika virus infection and positive Zika virus RNA detection in blood or\nurine were enrolled. Total sperm count was decreased from median\n119âÃâ10^6 spermatozoa (IQR interquartile range 22-234)\nat day 7, to 45.2âÃâ10^6 (16.5-89.6) at day 30, and 70\nÃ 10^6 (28.5-81.4) at day 60, respectively, after Zika virus\ninfection. Inhibin values increased from 93.5 pg/mL (IQR 55-162) at\nday 7 to 150 pg/mL (78-209) at day 120 when total sperm count\nrecovered. In motile spermatozoa obtained after density gradient\nseparation, Zika virus RNA was found in 3 of 14 patients at day 7, 4\nof 15 at day 11, and 4 of 15 at day 20, and replication-competent\nvirus was found in the tested patient. Seminal shedding kinetics\nseemed heterogeneous among patients. Whole blood was the fluid most\nfrequently positive for Zika virus RNA (62 of 92 samples) and 3\npatients remained positive at day 120. Interpretation\nSemen alterations early after acute Zika virus infection might affect\nfertility and could be explained by virus effects on the testis and\nepididymis. Frequency of shedding and high viral load in semen,\ntogether with the presence of replicative virus in a motile\nspermatozoa fraction, can lead to Zika virus transmission during\nsexual contact and assisted reproduction procedures. Whole blood seems\nto be the best specimen for Zika virus RNA detection, diagnosis, and\nfollow-up. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall In a new study that included 12 men in French Guiana who had Zika\nvirus, 4 never had any detectable Zika in their semen, 1 excreted Zika\nvirus in his semen for at least 3 days, and 7 had Zika virus in semen\nfor at least 1 month.

Multiple candidate Zika vaccines have been shown protective against\ninfection with the virus in animal studies, with several now in human\ntrials, but none were tested in the context of pregnancy, according to\nthe authors of the study published in Cell\n(http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(17)30759-6). The 2\nvaccine candidates investigated in the new study are the 1st to\ndemonstrate efficacy in preventing vertical transmission of the virus\nand related fetal death in an animal model. Although the vaccines were\nadministered to female mice prior to pregnancy, the result is\nconsidered an important step toward developing a vaccine that could be\nsafely given to pregnant women. One of the 2 candidates is a modified messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine\nencoding Zika genes, developed by the biotechnology company Moderna.\nIt is already in safety trials in women who are not pregnant. The\nother is a live-attenuated Zika strain developed by researchers at the\nUniversity of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB).

A week later, more than 50\npercent of placentas and fetuses from mice administered the mRNA\nvaccine had virtually no Zika RNA. The remainder had \"substantially\nlower\" levels relative to placebo.\nThe live vaccine provided broader protection: 78 percent of placentas\nand 83 percent of fetuses had Zika RNA at or below the level of\ndetection, while the placebo group exhibited significantly higher\nlevels of placental and fetal Zika RNA. Mice vaccinated with either\nvaccine had significantly higher rates of fetal viability; whereas 100\npercent of fetuses from mice vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine were\nborn, none survived to term in the placebo group. A working group funded by the Wellcome Trust recently approved ethical\nguidelines for testing such vaccines in pregnant women, normally\nexcluded from drug trials. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) It is reassuring to learn that at least 2 vaccines are now entering\nclinical trials in women. Although anti-Zika virus drugs are under\ndevelopment, preventing infection through vaccination seems to be the\nmost effective measure to prevent fetal infection and adverse effects\nof the virus infection in adults. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Mauritania":{"126":{"title":"Undiagnosed hemorrhagic illness - Mauritania: (TR) RFI\r\n\t","date":["24","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH/EDR> Undiagnosed hemorrhagic illness - Mauritania: (TR) RFI\r\n\t[EXTERNAL]","summary":"\nUNDIAGNOSED HEMORRHAGIC ILLNESS - MAURITANIA: (TRARZA) REQUEST FOR\nINFORMATION\n\nA ProMED-mail post\n(http://www.promedmail.org)\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n(http://www.isid.org).

Source: Outbreak News Today (edited) (http://outbreaknewstoday.com/mauritania-reports-confirmed-crimean-congo-hemorrhagic-fever-case-21416/)   On 24 Aug 2017, the Mauritania Ministry of Health notified WHO of a confirmed case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in a 47-year-old shepherd, from Arafat Village in Mohammedia, Boutilimit Prefecture, located about 150 km southeast of the capital, Nouakchott.  In May 2017, health officials reported 2 imported cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in Senegal imported from Mauritania. A 3rd imported case was reported in June 2017.  He developed headache, muscle and joints pains and diarrhea on 20 Aug 2017 and sought medical attention. He was treated with anti-malarial medicines and analgesics.  After 2 days, he returned for medical care as his condition worsened. He was tested for CCHF because of bleeding manifestations and was IgM positive for Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The patient is still hospitalized and in stable clinical condition.  Mauritania experienced a fairly large CCHF outbreak in 2003, involving 38 cases with a case fatality rate of 28.6 percent. According to the WHO, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is a widespread disease caused by a tick-borne virus (Nairovirus) of the Bunyaviridae family. The CCHF virus causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 percent.  CCHF is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and Asian countries south of the 50th parallel north, the geographical limit of the principal tick vector. The hosts of the CCHF virus include a wide range of wild and domestic animals such as cattle, sheep and goats.  Animals become infected by the bite of infected ticks, and the virus remains in their bloodstream for about one week after infection, allowing the tick-animal-tick cycle to continue when another tick bites. Although a number of tick genera are capable of becoming infected with CCHF virus, ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_ are the principal vectors.  The CCHF virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians. Human-to-human transmission is possible.  Byline: Robert Herriman   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  An outbreak of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever was documented in Nouakchott, the capital of Mauritania in 2003. The index case was detected on 18 Feb 2003. By 21 Mar 2003, the Ministry of Health of Mauritania had reported a total of 35 cases (18 laboratory confirmed) of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), including 6 deaths Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever - Mauritania (04) http://promedmail.org/post/20030324.0732.  In the period from February to August 2003, 38 persons were infected with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus; 35 of these persons were residents of Nouakchott. The 1st patient was a young woman who became ill shortly after butchering a goat. She transmitted the infection to 15 persons in the hospital where she was admitted and 4 members of her family. In Nouakchott, 2 disease clusters and 11 isolated cases were identified. Of the patients not infected by the 1st case-patient, almost half were butchers, which suggests that the primary mode of animal-to-human transmission was direct contact with blood of infected animals.  Cattle heavily infested with ticks were more likely to be CCHFV seropositive, and vector control to reduce the tick burden can result in reduced seroprevalence. Cattle are noted as the most sensitive indicator of low-level CCHFV circulation because they tend to be highly infested with _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks, which are the most common vectors of CCHF (http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0004210).  The circulation of CCHF virus and the high prevalence of infected animals and ticks have been well documented in Mauritanian farming areas since 1983 Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever and Rift Valley fever in south-eastern Mauritania.

Source: FreshPlaza (edited) (http://www.freshplaza.com/article/179770/Anthracnose-marring-Mexican-mangoes)   As volume of mangoes from Mexico starts building, customers are noticing a problem that can pester mango growers and sellers. Anthracnose black spots have developed thanks in part to a rainy season. Part of the problem is that the anthracnose isn't being detected until it's too late.  \"In Florida USA, we pick mango with great ripeness,\" says a Florida mango grower. \"But in Mexico, they have to pick it almost green and they don't see the anthracnose until it gets ripe. So when they come through everything looks fine, but at the stores, there have been a lot of complaints.\"  Byline: Astrid van den Broek   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  Anthracnose is considered the most important disease of mango. It is caused by the fungi _Colletotrichum gloeosporioides_ (synonym _Glomerella cingulata_) or _C. acutatum_. Symptoms may include flower blight, pre- and post-harvest fruit rot, twig dieback, and leaf spots. Anthracnose can completely destroy the flowers and cause extensive dead areas on leaves, greatly reducing yield. The fungi apparently invade the skin of young fruit and remain in a latent state until fruit ripening begins. Ripe fruit, either before or after picking, can then develop prominent dark-brown to black spots. Fruit infection commonly occurs and can result in extensive rotting.  The fungi have a long saprophytic survival ability on dead twigs and fallen leaves. These are the main sources of inoculum and spread may occur with infected plant material, by mechanical means (including insect activities) and water splash. The disease is favoured by humid conditions during the period from the onset of flowering until fruit are about half size. Control of anthracnose in mango usually centers on a diligent fungicide programme, but may also include phytosanitation to reduce inoculum, as well as cultural measures to reduce moisture in the orchard. More Indo-Chinese/Philippine type mango varieties show levels of resistance to anthracnose than Indian type varieties.  Fungi in the genus _Colletotrichum_ have been reported to cause anthracnose-like symptoms on many crops.

Cyclosporiasis is the least-common reportable protozoan infection in the United States. In 2008, the reported disease rate among 10 states was 2.25 per 100 000 population.  The true incidence of foodborne cyclosporiasis in the United States has been estimated at 11 407 to 19 808 cases per year (15 hospitalizations), accounting for 0.1 percent of all foodborne illness. Approximately 42 percent of cases are imported.  1110 individual cases of cyclosporiasis were reported during 1997 to 2008. 849 (76.5 percent) of the cases occurred in 7 states, including 498 (44.9 percent of total) in Florida. 51.7 percent of cases with known travel history were autochthonous.  No fatal cases were reported during 1998 to 2006.  During 1998 to 2002, 9 foodborne outbreaks (325 cases) of cyclosporiasis were reported; 0 in 2007; 3 (66 total cases) in 2008; 1 (8 cases) in 2009; 0 in 2010. 11 outbreaks (3533 cases) related to imported food were reported during 1996 to 2014.

Here we evaluate the risk of Zika virus transmission through\nmucosal contact in rhesus macaques. Application of high-dose Zika\nvirus directly to the tonsils of 3 rhesus macaques results in\ndetectable plasma viremia in all animals by 2 days post-exposure;\nvirus replication kinetics are similar to those observed in animals\ninfected subcutaneously. 3 additional macaques inoculated\nsubcutaneously with Zika virus served as saliva donors to assess the\ntransmission risk from contact with oral secretions from an infected\nindividual. 7 naive animals repeatedly exposed to donor saliva via the\nconjunctivae, tonsils, or nostrils did not become infected.

Update: Interim guidance\nfor health care providers caring for pregnant women with possible Zika\nvirus exposure  United States (including US Territories), July 2017.\nMMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2017; 66(29): 781-93. doi:\n10.15585/mmwr.mm6629e1\n-\nCDC has updated the interim guidance for US health care providers\ncaring for pregnant women with possible Zika virus exposure in\nresponse to 1) declining prevalence of Zika virus disease in the World\nHealth Organization's Region of the Americas (Americas) and 2)\nemerging evidence indicating prolonged detection of Zika virus\nimmunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies. Zika virus cases were 1st reported\nin the Americas during 2015-2016; however, the incidence of Zika virus\ndisease has since declined. As the prevalence of Zika virus disease\ndeclines, the likelihood of false-positive test results increases. In\naddition, emerging epidemiologic and laboratory data indicate that, as\nis the case with other flaviviruses, Zika virus IgM antibodies can\npersist beyond 12 weeks after infection. Therefore, IgM test results\ncannot always reliably distinguish between an infection that occurred\nduring the current pregnancy and one that occurred before the current\npregnancy, particularly for women with possible Zika virus exposure\nbefore the current pregnancy. These limitations should be considered\nwhen counseling pregnant women about the risks and benefits of testing\nfor Zika virus infection during pregnancy. This updated guidance\nemphasizes a shared decision-making model for testing and screening\npregnant women, one in which patients and providers work together to\nmake decisions about testing and care plans based on patient\npreferences and values, clinical judgment, and a balanced assessment\nof risks and expected outcomes. For these recommendations, the definition of possible Zika virus\nexposure has not changed and includes travel to, or residence in an\narea with risk for mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission or sex with\na partner who has traveled to or resides in an area with risk for\nmosquito-borne Zika virus transmission. These areas can be found on\nthe CDC \"Zika Travel Information\" webpage. Key recommendations include the following:\n1- All pregnant women in the United States and US territories should\nbe asked about possible Zika virus exposure before and during the\ncurrent pregnancy, at every prenatal care visit. CDC recommends that\npregnant women not travel to any area with risk for Zika virus\ntransmission. It is also recommended that pregnant women with a sex\npartner who has traveled to or lives in an area with risk for Zika\nvirus transmission use condoms or abstain from sex for the duration of\nthe pregnancy.\n2- Pregnant women with recent possible Zika virus exposure and\nsymptoms of Zika virus disease should be tested to diagnose the cause\nof their symptoms. The updated recommendations include concurrent Zika\nvirus nucleic acid test (NAT) and serologic testing as soon as\npossible through 12 weeks after symptom onset.\n3- Asymptomatic pregnant women with ongoing possible Zika virus\nexposure should be offered Zika virus NAT testing 3 times during\npregnancy. IgM testing is no longer routinely recommended because IgM\ncan persist for months after infection; therefore, IgM results cannot\nreliably determine whether an infection occurred during the current\npregnancy. The optimal timing and frequency of testing of asymptomatic\npregnant women with NAT alone is unknown. For pregnant women who have\nreceived a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection (by\neither NAT or serology positive/equivocal Zika virus or dengue virus\nIgM and Zika virus plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) 10 and\nhigher and dengue virus PRNT less than 10 results) any time before or\nduring the current pregnancy, additional Zika virus testing is not\nrecommended. For pregnant women without a prior laboratory-confirmed\ndiagnosis of Zika virus, NAT testing should be offered at the\ninitiation of prenatal care, and if Zika virus RNA is not detected on\nclinical specimens, 2 additional tests should be offered during the\ncourse of the pregnancy coinciding with prenatal visits.\n4- Asymptomatic pregnant women who have recent possible Zika virus\nexposure (that is, through travel or sexual exposure) but without\nongoing possible exposure are not routinely recommended to have Zika\nvirus testing. Testing should be considered using a shared\npatient-provider decision-making model, one in which patients and\nproviders work together to make decisions about testing and care plans\nbased on patient preferences and values, clinical judgment, a balanced\nassessment of risks and expected outcomes, and the jurisdiction's\nrecommendations. Based on the epidemiology of Zika virus transmission\nand other epidemiologic considerations (such as, seasonality),\njurisdictions might recommend testing of asymptomatic pregnant women,\neither for clinical care or as part of Zika virus surveillance. With\nthe decline in the prevalence of Zika virus disease, the updated\nrecommendations for the evaluation and testing of pregnant women with\nrecent possible Zika virus exposure but without ongoing possible\nexposure are now the same for all areas with any risk for Zika virus\ntransmission.\n5- Pregnant women who have recent possible Zika virus exposure and who\nhave a fetus with prenatal ultrasound findings consistent with\ncongenital Zika virus syndrome should receive Zika virus testing to\nassist in establishing the etiology of the birth defects. Testing\nshould include both NAT and IgM tests.\n6- The comprehensive approach to testing placental and fetal tissues\nhas been updated. Testing placental and fetal tissue specimens can be\nperformed for diagnostic purposes in certain scenarios (e.g., women\nwithout a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection and\nwho have a fetus or infant with possible Zika virus-associated birth\ndefects). However, testing of placental tissues for Zika virus\ninfection is not routinely recommended for asymptomatic pregnant women\nwho have recent possible Zika virus exposure but without ongoing\npossible exposure and who have a live born infant without evidence of\npossible Zika virus-associated birth defects.\n7- Zika virus IgM testing as part of preconception counseling to\nestablish baseline IgM results for non pregnant women with ongoing\npossible Zika virus exposure is not warranted because Zika virus IgM\ntesting is no longer routinely recommended for asymptomatic pregnant\nwomen with ongoing possible Zika virus exposure. also at the source URL above:\nAdditional interim guidance:\n- Laboratory testing of pregnant women with exposure to areas with\nrisk for Zika virus transmission\n- Prenatal management of pregnant women with laboratory evidence of\npossible Zika virus infection\n- Evaluation of placental and fetal tissue specimens for Zika virus\ninfection \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org)\nand\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be)(promed@promedmail.org) Readers interested in accessing the full report can find it at the\nsource URL above.

What is the spectrum of neurologic manifestations in adults\nwith Zika virus infection?\nFindings. This cohort study evaluated adult patients with new-onset\nparainfectious or neuroinflammatory disease for the presence of acute\nZika virus infection in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples\nusing molecular and serological testing. An increase in the incidence\nof Guillain-Barré syndrome and encephalitis was observed compared\nwith the period before the outbreak of the Zika virus.\nMeaning The Zika virus may be associated with a rapid increase in the\nincidence of life-threatening neurologic syndromes; serologic and\nmolecular testing using blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples can\nserve as an alternative diagnostic strategy. Abstract\n\nImportance. There are no prospective cohort studies assessing the\nincidence and spectrum of neurologic manifestations secondary to Zika\nvirus (ZIKV) infection in adults.\nObjective. To evaluate the rates of acute ZIKV infection among\npatients hospitalized with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS),\nmeningoencephalitis, or transverse myelitis.\nDesign, setting, and participants. A prospective, observational cohort\nstudy was conducted at a tertiary referral center for neurological\ndiseases in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between 5 Dec 2015-10 May 2016,\namong consecutive hospitalized adults (older than 18 years of age)\nwith new-onset acute parainfectious or neuroinflammatory disease. All\nparticipants were tested for a series of arbovirosis. 3-month\nfunctional outcome was assessed.\nInterventions. Samples of serum and cerebrospinal fluid were tested\nfor ZIKV using real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain\nreaction and an IgM antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent\nassay. Clinical, radiographic (magnetic resonance imaging),\nelectrophysiological, and 3-month functional outcome data were\ncollected.\nMain outcomes and measures. The detection of neurologic complications\nsecondary to ZIKV infection.\nResults. 40 patients (15 women and 25 men; median age, 44 years\nrange, 22-72 years) were enrolled, including 29 patients (73\npercent) with GBS (90 percent Brighton level 1 certainty), 7 (18\npercent) with encephalitis, 3 (8 percent) with transverse myelitis,\nand 1 (3 percent) with newly diagnosed chronic inflammatory\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy. Of these, 35 patients (88 percent) had\nmolecular and/or serologic evidence of recent ZIKV infection in the\nserum and/or cerebrospinal fluid. Of the patients positive for ZIKV\ninfection, 27 had GBS (18 demyelinating, 8 axonal, and 1 Miller Fisher\nsyndrome), 5 had encephalitis (3 with concomitant acute neuromuscular\ndisease), 2 had transverse myelitis, and 1 had chronic inflammatory\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy. Admission to the intensive care unit was\nrequired for 9 patients positive for ZIKV infection (26 percent), and\n5 (14 percent) required mechanical ventilation. Compared with\nadmission during the period from 5 Dec 2013 - 10 May 2014 (before the\nBrazilian outbreak of ZIKV), admissions for GBS increased from a mean\nof 1.0 per month to 5.6 per month, admissions for encephalitis\nincreased from 0.4 per month to 1.4 per month, and admissions for\ntransverse myelitis remained constant at 0.6 per month. At 3 months, 2\npatients positive for ZIKV infection (6 percent) died (1 with GBS and\n1 with encephalitis), 18 (51 percent) had chronic pain, and the median\nmodified Rankin score among survivors was 2 (range, 0-5).\nConclusions and relevance. In this single-center Brazilian cohort,\nZIKV infection was associated with an increase in the incidence of a\ndiverse spectrum of serious neurologic syndromes. The data also\nsuggest that serologic and molecular testing using blood and\ncerebrospinal fluid samples can serve as a less expensive, alternative\ndiagnostic strategy in developing countries, where plaque reduction\nneutralization testing is impractical. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) This study illustrates the need to consider post-Zika virus infection\nas a cause of a variety of neurological diseases.

We found that ZIKV\npersistently infects brain endothelial cells that normally protect\nneurons from viral exposure. hBMECs are not damaged by ZIKV infection\nand, analogous to persistent HCV infection, ZIKV constitutively\ninduces and evades antiviral ISG IFN-stimulated genes and IFN\ninterferon responses to continuously replicate in hBMECs. As a\nresult, hBMECs provide a protective niche for systemic ZIKV spread and\na viral reservoir localized in the normally protective blood-brain\nbarrier. Consistent with the spread of ZIKV into neuronal\ncompartments, ZIKV was released basolaterally from hBMECs. Our\nfindings define hBMEC responses that contribute to persistent ZIKV\ninfection and potential targets for clearing ZIKV infections from\nhBMECs.

PLoS\nPathog. 2017; 13(8): e1006487. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006487\n-\nAbstract\n\nStudies have demonstrated cross-reactivity of anti-dengue virus (DENV)\nantibodies in human sera against Zika virus (ZIKV), promoting\nincreased ZIKV infection in vitro. However, the correlation between in\nvitro and in vivo findings is not well characterized. Thus, we\nevaluated the impact of heterotypic flavivirus immunity on ZIKV titers\nin biofluids of rhesus macaques. Animals previously infected (420 days\nor longer) with DENV2, DENV4, or yellow fever virus were compared to\nflavivirus-naïve animals following infection with a Brazilian ZIKV\nstrain. Sera from DENV-immune macaques demonstrated cross-reactivity\nwith ZIKV by antibody-binding and neutralization assays prior to ZIKV\ninfection, and promoted increased ZIKV infection in cell culture\nassays. Despite these findings, no significant differences between\nflavivirus-naïve and immune animals were observed in viral titers,\nneutralizing antibody levels, or immune cell kinetics following ZIKV\ninfection. These results indicate that prior infection with\nheterologous flaviviruses neither conferred protection nor increased\nobserved ZIKV titers in this non-human primate ZIKV infection model. Author summary\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne, emerging flavivirus. In\naddition to asymptomatic or mild febrile manifestations, ZIKV\ninfection in humans is associated with comparatively rare congenital\nand neurological abnormalities. Previous in vitro studies have\ndemonstrated cross-reactivity of antibodies derived from dengue virus\ninfections with ZIKV, as well as antibody-mediated enhancement of\ninfection in cell culture. Therefore, there is concern among\nvaccinologists and the public health community that the more severe\ndisease manifestations could result from prior immunity, either from\nnatural infection or vaccination, to antigenically-related\nflaviviruses (such as, dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis).\nIn this study, we evaluated the impact of prior immunity to dengue or\nyellow fever virus on ZIKV infection in a non-human primate model.\nAfter confirming that our immune cohorts were capable of\nrecapitulating the published in vitro observations of cross-reactivity\nand enhancement, we looked for alteration of viral titers in\nperipheral blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, and vaginal\nsecretions, as well as alterations in gross pathology, clinical\nparameters, and immune response, as compared to our flavivirus-naïve\ncohort. Importantly, no significant differences between\nflavivirus-naïve and primed animals were observed in viral titers or\nbiofluid distribution, neutralizing antibody levels, or immune cell\nkinetics following ZIKV infection. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org)\nand\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be)(promed@promedmail.org) Previous dengue infection, whether acquired naturally or antibody\nelicited by vaccines, has been a concern due to the possibility of\nantibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) with more severe disease. This\nconcern also relates to Zika virus antibody from vaccination for\nenhancement of dengue virus infections with resulting more severe\ndisease. The monkey studies reported above indicated that this may not\nbe a problem for Zika virus vaccinated individuals. Another effort to\navoid ADE is development of a vaccine that has epitopes specific for\nZika virus that are not shared by other flaviviruses. A group of\nresearchers developed a recombinant vaccine targeting a viral envelope\nsub-unit specific to the Zika virus\n((http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/news-and-analysis/news-in-brief/researchers-find-way-to-overcome-zika-vaccinedengue-virus-conundrum/20203379.article)).\nRoland Hübner is thanked for calling this latter reference to our\nattention. - Mod.TY \n<br><br><strong>{8}</strong> Virus inhibition.\nDate: 25 Jul 2017.\nSource: Nature Communications (edited)\n(https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15672) \nref: Yu Y, Deng YQ, Zou P, et al.

Z2 can\npenetrate the placental barrier to enter fetal tissues and is safe for\nuse in pregnant mice. Intraperitoneal administration of Z2 inhibits\nvertical transmission of ZIKV in pregnant C57BL/6 mice and protects\ntype I or type I/II interferon receptor-deficient mice against lethal\nZIKV challenge.

PLoS Pathog. 2017; 13(7): e1006537. doi:\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1006537\n-\nAbstract\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted virus that can cause\nsevere defects in an infected fetus. ZIKV is also transmitted by\nsexual contact, although the relative importance of sexual\ntransmission is unclear. To better understand the role of sexual\ntransmission in ZIKV pathogenesis, a nonhuman primate (NHP) model of\nvaginal transmission was developed. ZIKV was readily transmitted to\nmature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by vaginal inoculation was\nreadily transmitted to mature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by\nvaginal individual RM with 1-5 vaginal inoculations required to\nestablish infection. After treatment with Depoprovera, a widely used\ncontraceptive progestin, 2 RM that initially resisted 8 vaginal ZIKV\ninoculations became infected after one ZIKV inoculation. Thus,\nDepoprovera seemed to enhance susceptibility to vaginal ZIKV\ntransmission. Unexpectedly, the kinetics of virus replication and\ndissemination after intravaginal ZIKV inoculation were markedly\ndifferent from RM infected with ZIKV by subcutaneous (SQ) virus\ninoculation. Several groups have reported that after SQ ZIKV\ninoculation vRNA is rapidly detected in blood plasma with vRNA less\ncommon in urine and saliva and only rarely detected in female\nreproductive tract (FRT) secretions. In contrast, in vaginally\ninoculated RM, plasma vRNA is delayed for several days and ZIKV\nreplication in, and vRNA shedding from, the FRT was found in all 6\nanimals. Further, after intravaginal transmission ZIKV RNA shedding\nfrom FRT secretions was detected before or simultaneously with plasma\nvRNA, and persisted for at least as long. Thus, ZIKV replication in\nthe FRT was independent of, and often preceded virus replication in\nthe tissues contributing to plasma vRNA. These results support the\nconclusion that ZIKV preferentially replicates in the FRT after\nvaginal transmission, but not after SQ transmission, and raise the\npossibility that there is enhanced fetal infection and pathology after\nvaginal ZIKV transmission compared to a mosquito transmitted ZIKV. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{10}</strong> _Aedes albopictus_ populations as vectors.\nDate: 2 Aug 2017.\nSource: American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (edited)\n(http://www.ajtmh.org/content/journals/10.4269/ajtmh.16-0969) \nref: Azar SR, Roundy CM, Rossi SL, et al.

Positive saliva samples were assayed for\ninfectious titer. Although all 3 mosquito populations were susceptible\nto all ZIKV strains, rates of infection, dissemination, and\ntransmission differed among mosquito and virus strains. _Aedes\nalbopictus_ from Salvador, Brazil, were the least efficient vectors,\ndemonstrating susceptibility to infection to 2 American strains of\nZIKV but failing to shed virus in saliva. Mosquitoes from the Rio\nGrande Valley were the most efficient vectors and were capable of\nshedding all 3 tested ZIKV strains into saliva after 14 days of\nextrinsic incubation. In particular, ZIKV strain DakAR 41525 (Senegal\n1954) was significantly more efficient at dissemination and saliva\ndeposition than the others tested in Rio Grande mosquitoes.

Emerg Microbes\nInfect. 2017; 6(8): e69. doi: 10.1038/emi.2017.59\n-\nAbstract\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has recently been associated\nwith an increased incidence of neonatal microcephaly and other\nneurological disorders. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito\nbite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some\ncases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main\nvector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other\nmosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the\nvirus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit\nZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of\nlaboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_.\nInterestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the\nmidgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in\nRecife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially\nfed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced.\nCollectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range\nof ZIKV vectors than anticipated. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be) Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active\nvirus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their\nability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step\ntoward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_\nfed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in\nsaliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing.\nThe study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a\ncompetent vector. Several other studies have shown this species to be\ninefficient vectors or refractory to Zika virus infection. One wonders\nif the specific _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ used or the Zika virus isolates\nwith which they were tested could account for these very different\nresults. Resolving these discrepancies is important because this\nmosquito species is very widely distributed around the world and bears\ndirectly on risk of outbreaks in geographic areas where _Aedes\naegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_ , Zika virus vectors, do not occur. -\nMod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"72":{"title":"Chikungunya (27) - Americas, Europe, Asia ","date":["18","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Chikungunya (27) - Americas, Europe, Asia [EXTERNAL]","summary":"\nCHIKUNGUNYA (27) - AMERICAS, EUROPE, ASIA\n*\nA ProMED-mail post\n(http://www.promedmail.org)\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n(http://www.isid.org) In this update:\nCases in various countries:\nRegional summaries\n\nAmericas\n\nRegional summary\nWHO/PAHO report Mexico and Central America\n\nMexico (Jalisco state)\nCosta Rica South America\n\nArgentina (Salto province)\nBrazil:\n- Roraima state\n- Ceara state\nPeru (Piura region) Europe\n\nFrance (Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region in Provence) Asia\n\nTaiwan (Tainan)\nIndia:\n- Delhi\n- Ludhiana, Punjab\n- Chandigarh, Haryana and Punjab states\n- Tamil Nadu state\n- Baramati tehsil, Pune, Maharastra state\n- Pune Maharashtra state ex Assam state\n- Kerala state\nBangladesh (Dhaka)\nNepal (Bhaktapur, province 3) \nCases in various countries:\nRegional summaries\n\nAmericas\n\nWHO/PAHO report\n18 Aug 2017\n(http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_topics&view=rdmore&cid=8975&Itemid=40931&lang=en) \nReported cases of chikungunya fever in the Americas, by country or\nterritory - 2017 to EW 33 week ending 18 Aug 2017.

While some individuals may\ndevelop mild symptoms, others may go on to develop long-term chronic\nsymptoms. The signs and symptoms of brucellosis are extensive, and\nthey can be similar to many other febrile illnesses, so recognition of\npotential exposure from ingestion of unpasteurized milk or cheese,\nworking in a slaughter house or meat processing plant, or working in a\nmicrobiology lab is critical information when evaluating a case. The post does not state if the diagnoses were made by culture or by\nserology. A previous post in March 2017 reported only 5 cases. It is\nnot clear over what period the 19 cases occurred.

(https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/9/17-0523_article)   Antimicrobial drug-resistant Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ infections, Michigan, USA  Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ (STEC) also called enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ - EHEC - Mod.LL contributes to 265 000 cases of foodborne illness annually in the USA (1). Most infections are caused by O157 strains; however, non-O157 EHEC infections have increased (2). Antimicrobial drug resistance among EHEC has been reported (3-5) but is probably underestimated. Given the importance of resistance in _E. coli_ pathotypes, we sought to determine the prevalence of resistant EHEC infections and assess the effects of resistance on disease.  We obtained 358 STEC isolates from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) Reference Laboratory (Lansing, MI, USA), collected during 2010-2014. Of these, 14 were outbreak associated. We examined one strain per outbreak using protocols approved by Michigan State University and MDHHS. Overall, 31 (8.8 per cent) strains (23 non-O157, 8 O157) were resistant to antimicrobial drugs (table for table and figures, see original URL - Mod.LL). Resistance to ampicillin (7.4 per cent) was the commonest, followed by trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT) (4.0 per cent) and ciprofloxacin (0.3 per cent). Compared with national rates, resistance to ampicillin and SXT was higher, but not significantly different, for O157 isolates from Michigan (figure 1) (6). One strain was resistant to all drugs, and all resistant strains had high MICs (ampicillin, )64 ug/mL; ciprofloxacin, )32 ug/mL; SXT, in 1:19 ratio, )32/608 ug/mL). Notably, resistance was twice as common for non-O157 (11.1 per cent) than for O157 (5.5 per cent) strains. O111 strains (n=7) had significantly higher resistance frequencies (24.1 per cent) than other non-O157 serogroups (p=0.03). We found variation by year and season; resistance frequencies were highest in 2012 (figure 2) and during winter/spring (table 1), but neither trend was significant. We also observed a strong but nonsignificant association between resistance and hospitalization but no association for urban versus rural residence (7) or county after stratifying by prescription rates (8) in the univariate analyses.  We conducted a multivariate analysis using logistic regression, with hospitalization as the dependent variable; we included variables with significant (p(0.05) and strong (p(0.20) associations from the univariate analysis as independent variables. Forward selection indicated that hospitalized patients were more likely to have resistant infections (odds ratio OR 2.4, 95 per cent confidence interval CI 1.00-5.82) and less likely to have non-O157 infections (OR 0.4, CI 0.21-0.61) (table 2), suggesting that resistant infections or O157 infections may cause more severe clinical outcomes. Patients over 18 years of age, women, and patients with bloody diarrhea were also more likely to be hospitalized.  Although we found no significant difference by stx profile, strains possessing stx1 only were more commonly resistant than strains with stx2 alone (p=0.27 by Fisher exact test). All 23 (100 per cent) resistant non-O157 EHEC and 1 (12.5 per cent) resistant O157 strain had stx1 only. Strains positive for eae were less likely to be resistant (n=27; 8.4 per cent) than eae-negative strains (n=4; 23.5 per cent); this nonsignificant difference (p=0.07 by Fisher exact test) could be due to small sample sizes. All 8 resistant O157 strains and 18 (78.3 per cent) of 23 resistant non-O157 strains had eae, demonstrating correlations between virulence genes and serogroups.  Overall, we detected a high frequency of resistance among non-O157 EHEC (11.2 per cent), similar to findings from Mexico (15 per cent), although we evaluated fewer drugs (5). Resistance to ciprofloxacin was low despite its routine use for treating enteric infections, perhaps because resistance development in _E. coli_ requires multiple mutations (9). Resistance frequencies in EHEC were low relative to other _E. coli_ pathotypes such as extraintestinal _E. coli_, which may be attributable to differences in the source of the infections (3).  The higher O157 resistance frequencies in Michigan than nationwide indicate that selection pressures vary by location and source. Although we observed no difference in resistance frequencies for counties with high versus low antimicrobial drug prescription rates (8), we have not investigated selection pressures from drug use in farm environments that may affect resistance emergence in Michigan. Approximately 12 million kg of antimicrobial drugs are administered to food animals annually in the USA; roughly 61 per cent of these are medically relevant. Higher resistance frequencies in winter/spring (12.2 per cent) than summer/fall (7.5 per cent) could be attributed to variation in prescription rates by season (10).  Because Michigan is not part of the CDC Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network and resistance in EHEC has not been widely researched, data about the prevalence and impact of resistance are lacking. This study detected a high frequency of EHEC resistance to antimicrobial drugs commonly used in human and veterinary medicine, particularly for non-O157 serotypes, which have increased in frequency (2). Monitoring resistance in EHEC is essential because of the risk of transmitting resistant strains from food animals to humans and the high likelihood of horizontal transfer of resistance genes from EHEC to other pathogens. Routine monitoring can uncover new treatment approaches and guide development of strategies for controlling emergence and spread of resistance in EHEC and other _E. coli_ pathotypes.  References - 1.

(promed@promedmail.org)  The degree of antimicrobial resistance in this report seems no more than what is seen in community-acquired non-EHEC infections.  Regarding the use of antimicrobials in EHEC is often a moot point since in most cases they are not utilized, at least early, because of the increased risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome but is relevant in cases where embarrassment of the colonic lumen occurs. In the large _E. coli_ O104:H4 outbreak in northern Germany, antimicrobial therapy was used especially in those cases where the colon was perforated. In those reports, the carbapenem antimicrobials also did not increase toxin production. Whether these effects are strain specific is not clear at this time so should not necessarily be generalized to all EHEC. Of note, the _E. coli_ O104:H4 strain is a genetic hybrid between EHEC and enteroaggregative _E. coli_ and not thought to be a zoonosis.  Extraintestinal invasive strains of EHEC (ProMED-mail. E. coli EHEC - France: O80:H2, hybrid invasive pathogen, 2005-2014 http://promedmail.org/post/20160909.4474015 and other reports) indeed introduces another layer of concern about these infections. - Mod.LL  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/225).

Researchers have found\n_Aedes aegypti_  one of 2 mosquito species capable of transmitting\nthe viral illness  in the City of Socorro, the New Mexico Department\nof Health DOH said today Tue 22 Aug 2017. Socorro marks the\nnorthern-most location of _Aedes aegypti_ yet found in the state. No human cases of Zika virus have been identified in Socorro County to\ndate. There have been no confirmed cases of Zika virus in New Mexico\nresidents this year 2017. In 2016, 10 cases of Zika virus disease\nwere reported in New Mexico, but none was infected locally. In each\ncase, travelers were infected abroad and diagnosed after they returned\nhome. Researchers at New Mexico State University under contract with DOH are\nmapping the range and distribution of both _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes\nalbopictus_  the 2 species that can transmit Zika virus to people.\nThe work began in 2016 when the viral illness was linked to severe\nbirth defects in Brazil and other nations in the Americas. These\nspecies of mosquitoes become infected when they take blood from a\nperson already infected with the virus. Once infected, the mosquitoes\ncan bite and infect other people. _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes have been trapped and identified in Doña\nAna, Eddy, Chaves, Sierra, Lea, Otero, Hidalgo, and Socorro counties.\n_Aedes albopictus_ has been found in Roosevelt County. byline: Olivier Uyttebrouck \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) Although _ Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes have been found in southern New\nMexico counties in earlier years, this is the 1st report that\nProMED-mail has posted of detection of _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes in\nSocorro county. Finding _Ae. aegypti_ in this county is not\nsurprising. Both _Ae. aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ have been found in\nvarious locations in New Mexico. Both have been detected in southern\nNew Mexico but the above report does not indicate if populations of\nthe potential vectors are established and abundant enough to permit\nongoing transmission. Thus far, no locally acquired cases of Zika\nvirus infection in New Mexico have been documented. _Ae. aegypti_ and\n_Ae. albopictus_ have been found in new geographic areas in the USA. Air conditioning and screened windows and doors will help limit their\nabundance. However, the introduction of viruses such as Zika,\nchikungunya or dengue into New Mexico will continue, so aggressive\nvector surveillance and control will be important to limit populations\nof these vectors. - Mod.TY A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at:\n(http://healthmap.org/promed/p/233).

Antiviral Res. 2017; 146: 1-11.\ndoi: 10.1016/j.antiviral.2017.08.007\n-\nHighlights\n- Ribavirin inhibits ZIKV replication in mammalian cells.\n- Ribavirin prevents ZIKV-induced apoptosis and cell death.\n- Ribavirin administration abrogates viremia in ZIKV-infected\nSTAT1-deficient mice.\n- Leading to a prolonged survival.\nAbstract\nZika fever, a mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by Zika virus\n(ZIKV), is an epidemic disease for which no effective therapy has been\nestablished. The recent outbreaks of ZIKV in Brazil and French\nPolynesia have been linked to a considerable increase in the incidence\nof fetal microcephaly and other diseases such as Guillain-Barre\nsyndrome. Because there is currently no specific therapy or vaccine,\nthe early exploitation of a method to prevent expansion of ZIKV is a\nhigh priority. To validate commonly used antiviral drugs, we evaluated\nthe effect of ribavirin, a drug used to treat hepatitis C with\ninterferon-beta (IFN-beta), on ZIKV replication. In mammalian cells,\nwe observed an inhibitory effect of ribavirin on ZIKV replication and\nZIKV-induced cell death without cytotoxic effect. Furthermore, we\nfound that STAT1-deficient mice, which lack type I IFN signaling, were\nhighly sensitive to ZIKV infection and exhibited lethal outcome.\nRibavirin abrogated viremia in ZIKV-infected STAT-1-deficient mice.\nThese data suggest that the inhibition of viral RNA-dependent RNA\npolymerases may be effective for treatment of ZIKV infection. Our data\nprovide a new insight into the mechanisms for inhibition of ZIKV\nreplication and prevention of Zika fever. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) It will be interesting to see if these encouraging results showing\ninhibition of Zika virus replication can be replicated in non-human\nprimates. The challenge for use of drugs to inhibit Zika virus\ninfection in humans is that most (around 80 percent) Zika virus\ninfections are asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms. These\nindividuals will probably not seek medical treatment, even though\ntheir fetuses are at risk of infection with teratogenic effects. -\nMod.TY \n<br><br><strong>{3}</strong> Zika virus skewed immunosuppression.\nDate: Mon 21 Aug 2017.\nSource: Nature Microbiology journal (edited)\n(http://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-017-0016-3) \nref: Foo SS, Chen W, Chan Y, et al. Asian Zika virus strains target\nCD14+ blood monocytes and induce M2-skewed immunosuppression during\npregnancy. Nat Microbiol. 2017. doi: 10.1038/s41564-017-0016-3\n-\nAbstract\nBlood CD14+ monocytes are frontline immunomodulators categorized into\nclassical, intermediate or non-classical subsets, and subsequently\ndifferentiated into M1 pro- or M2 anti-inflammatory macrophages on\nstimulation. Although the Zika virus (ZIKV) rapidly establishes\nviraemia, the target cells and immune responses, particularly during\npregnancy, remain elusive. Furthermore, it is unknown whether African-\nand Asian-lineage ZIKV have different phenotypic impacts on host\nimmune responses. Using human blood infection, we identified CD14+\nmonocytes as the primary target for African- or Asian-lineage ZIKV\ninfection. When immunoprofiles of human blood infected with ZIKV were\ncompared, a classical/intermediate monocyte-mediated M1-skewed\ninflammation by the African-lineage ZIKV infection was observed, in\ncontrast to a non-classical monocyte-mediated M2-skewed\nimmunosuppression by the Asian-lineage ZIKV infection. Importantly,\ninfection of the blood of pregnant women revealed an enhanced\nsusceptibility to ZIKV infection. Specifically, Asian-lineage ZIKV\ninfection of pregnant women's blood led to an exacerbated M2-skewed\nimmunosuppression of non-classical monocytes in conjunction with a\nglobal suppression of type I interferon-signaling pathway and an\naberrant expression of host genes associated with pregnancy\ncomplications. Also, 30 ZIKV+ sera from symptomatic pregnant patients\nshowed elevated levels of M2-skewed immunosuppressive cytokines and\npregnancy-complication-associated fibronectin-1. This study\ndemonstrates the differential immunomodulatory responses of blood\nmonocytes, particularly during pregnancy, on infection with different\nlineages of ZIKV. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{4}</strong> Virus alters mosquito genes.\nDate: Tue 22 Aug 2017.\nSource: bioRxiv journal (edited)\n(http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/22/179416) \nref: Etebari K, Hegde S, Saldana MA, et al. Global transcriptome\nanalysis of _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes in response to Zika virus\ninfection. bioRxiv 179416; doi:10.1101/179416\n-\nZika virus (ZIKV) of the Flaviviridae family is a recently emerged\nmosquito-borne virus that has been implicated in the surge of the\nnumber of microcephaly instances in South America. The recent rapid\nspread of the virus led to its declaration as a global health\nemergency by the World Health Organization. The virus is transmitted\nmainly by the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_ that also vectors dengue virus,\nhowever little is known about the interactions of the virus with the\nmosquito vector. In this study, we investigated the transcriptome\nprofiles of whole _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes in response to ZIKV\ninfection at 2, 7, and 14 days post-infection using RNA-Seq. Results\nshowed changes in the abundance of a large number of transcripts at\neach time point following infection, with 18 transcripts commonly\nchanged among the 3 time points. Gene ontology analysis revealed that\nmost of the altered genes are involved in metabolic process, cellular\nprocess and proteolysis. In addition, 486 long intergenic non-coding\nRNAs were identified altered upon ZIKV infection. Further, we found\ncorrelational changes of a number of potential mRNA target genes with\nthat of altered host microRNAs. The outcomes provide a basic\nunderstanding of _Ae. aegypti_ responses to ZIKV and helps to\ndetermine host factors involved in replication or mosquito host\nanti-viral response against the virus. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) Mosquito vector competence depends on the relationship of virus and\nthe mosquito, and the defenses that the mosquito can mobilize against\nthe virus infection. Studies, such as the one above, can document the\nchanges that occur when the virus infects the mosquito, and if\ndifferences in relative vector efficiency of different geographic\nstrains of this mosquito might be related to alternations in mosquito\ngenes when infected. It would be interesting to know if these gene\nchanges affect fitness, and especially longevity of infected\nmosquitoes. - Mod.TY \n<br><br><strong>{5}</strong> Virus effects on sperm, body fluids.\nDate: Mon 21 Aug 2017.\nSource: The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal (edited)\n(http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(17)30444-9/abstract) \nref: Joguet G, Mansuy JM, Matusali G, et al.

To investigate the effects of Zika\nvirus infection on semen and clearance of Zika virus from semen and\nbody fluids, we aimed to study a cohort of Zika virus-infected men. Methods\nThis prospective observational study recruited men presenting with\nacute Zika virus infection at Pointe-Ã -Pitre University Hospital in\nGuadeloupe, French Caribbean, where a Zika virus outbreak occurred\nbetween April and November, 2016. Blood, urine, and semen were\ncollected at days 7, 11, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 after symptom onset,\nand semen characteristics, such as total sperm count, sperm motility,\nvitality, and morphology, and reproductive hormone concentrations,\nsuch as testosterone, inhibin, follicle-stimulating hormone, and\nluteinising hormone, were assessed. At days 7, 11, and 20, semen was\nprocessed to isolate motile spermatozoa. Zika virus RNA was detected\nby RT-PCR using whole blood, serum, urine, seminal plasma, semen\ncells, and motile spermatozoa fractions. Zika virus was isolated from\ndifferent sperm fractions on Vero E6 cultures. Findings\n15 male volunteers (mean age 35 years SD 5; range 25-44) with acute\nZika virus infection and positive Zika virus RNA detection in blood or\nurine were enrolled. Total sperm count was decreased from median\n119âÃâ10^6 spermatozoa (IQR interquartile range 22-234)\nat day 7, to 45.2âÃâ10^6 (16.5-89.6) at day 30, and 70\nÃ 10^6 (28.5-81.4) at day 60, respectively, after Zika virus\ninfection. Inhibin values increased from 93.5 pg/mL (IQR 55-162) at\nday 7 to 150 pg/mL (78-209) at day 120 when total sperm count\nrecovered. In motile spermatozoa obtained after density gradient\nseparation, Zika virus RNA was found in 3 of 14 patients at day 7, 4\nof 15 at day 11, and 4 of 15 at day 20, and replication-competent\nvirus was found in the tested patient. Seminal shedding kinetics\nseemed heterogeneous among patients. Whole blood was the fluid most\nfrequently positive for Zika virus RNA (62 of 92 samples) and 3\npatients remained positive at day 120. Interpretation\nSemen alterations early after acute Zika virus infection might affect\nfertility and could be explained by virus effects on the testis and\nepididymis. Frequency of shedding and high viral load in semen,\ntogether with the presence of replicative virus in a motile\nspermatozoa fraction, can lead to Zika virus transmission during\nsexual contact and assisted reproduction procedures. Whole blood seems\nto be the best specimen for Zika virus RNA detection, diagnosis, and\nfollow-up. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall In a new study that included 12 men in French Guiana who had Zika\nvirus, 4 never had any detectable Zika in their semen, 1 excreted Zika\nvirus in his semen for at least 3 days, and 7 had Zika virus in semen\nfor at least 1 month. The maximum duration of detectable Zika in semen\nin the study was 45 days ((http://tinyurl.com/y9nhtgtk)).

Vaccines protect fetus from Zika. JAMA. 2017; 318(8):\n689. doi:10.1001/jama.2017.11200\n-\nResearchers funded in part by the National Institutes of Health have\nrecently demonstrated that 2 experimental vaccines can restrict\ntransmission of Zika virus from pregnant mice to their fetuses,\nthereby shielding offspring from congenital damage or death. Multiple candidate Zika vaccines have been shown protective against\ninfection with the virus in animal studies, with several now in human\ntrials, but none were tested in the context of pregnancy, according to\nthe authors of the study published in Cell\n(http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(17)30759-6). The 2\nvaccine candidates investigated in the new study are the 1st to\ndemonstrate efficacy in preventing vertical transmission of the virus\nand related fetal death in an animal model. Although the vaccines were\nadministered to female mice prior to pregnancy, the result is\nconsidered an important step toward developing a vaccine that could be\nsafely given to pregnant women. One of the 2 candidates is a modified messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine\nencoding Zika genes, developed by the biotechnology company Moderna.\nIt is already in safety trials in women who are not pregnant. The\nother is a live-attenuated Zika strain developed by researchers at the\nUniversity of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). The testing was carried out by scientists from the National Institute\nof Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Washington University School of\nMedicine, and UTMB. The researchers 1st vaccinated the mice with 1 of\nthe vaccines or a placebo. After mating, the animals were challenged\nwith the virus 6 days into pregnancy. A week later, more than 50\npercent of placentas and fetuses from mice administered the mRNA\nvaccine had virtually no Zika RNA. The remainder had \"substantially\nlower\" levels relative to placebo.\nThe live vaccine provided broader protection: 78 percent of placentas\nand 83 percent of fetuses had Zika RNA at or below the level of\ndetection, while the placebo group exhibited significantly higher\nlevels of placental and fetal Zika RNA. Mice vaccinated with either\nvaccine had significantly higher rates of fetal viability; whereas 100\npercent of fetuses from mice vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine were\nborn, none survived to term in the placebo group. A working group funded by the Wellcome Trust recently approved ethical\nguidelines for testing such vaccines in pregnant women, normally\nexcluded from drug trials. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) It is reassuring to learn that at least 2 vaccines are now entering\nclinical trials in women. Although anti-Zika virus drugs are under\ndevelopment, preventing infection through vaccination seems to be the\nmost effective measure to prevent fetal infection and adverse effects\nof the virus infection in adults. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"297":{"title":"Dengue/DHF update (11): Americas","date":["28","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Dengue/DHF update (11): Americas","summary":"\nDENGUE/DHF UPDATE (11): AMERICAS\n\nA ProMED-mail post\n(http://www.promedmail.org)\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n(http://www.isid.org) In this update:\nCases in various countries:\nAmericas regional\n\nCases in various countries not mentioned above or more recent case\nnumbers.

(promed@promedmail.org)  As reported in EUFMD's most recent Global FMD situation report (July 2017), the WRLFMD at Pirbright has sequenced a field isolate received there from Mongolia (O/MOG/10/2017), genotyped as 'O/ME-SA/PanAsia'. The Mongolian virus was subjected to vaccine matching strain differentiation (VMSD) test, with the following results: \"good matching results with O/TUR/5/2009 but not with O 3039 and Manisa\". It will be interesting to note if the vaccine applied in Mongolia has been selected according to the said VMSD test results. The genotyping results above are not yet available on the WRLFMD website.  An OIE interactive map showing the locations of the 20 FMDV-O outbreaks reported from Mongolia since the start of the event (20 Jan 2017) is available at (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=22811).  According to Mongolia's National Broadcast, dated 30 Aug 2017 (machine-translated from (https://www.mnb.mn/i/121355)), FMD is also circulating in the eastern province (aimag) of Sukhbaatar, as well as the central province of Tuv (Tov), and in 2 districts (soums) (Songino Khairkhan and Khan-Uul) of the Mongolian capital of Ulaanbaatar. This presents a spread of the virus westwards, not yet reported to the OIE (map at (http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/asia/political-map-of-Mongolia.gif)).  The media report also includes the following data on vaccination: \"The vaccination program was implemented from 11 Aug 2017 in 934 427 livestock . Currently, vaccinations of 750 363 heads of livestock in 6 districts are being implemented, of which 83.7 percent have already been completed.\" It is not clear if the said vaccinations cover also the recently infected central regions. - Mod.AS  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1).

The outbreak is in\nsouthern Mozambique close to the Soutrh African border. - Mod.MJH \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) The reporting of anthrax in Mozambique is sporadic at best,\nreflecting government service infrastructure problems, but this is a\nbreakthrough facilitated by their South Africa neighbour. May it lay\nthe groundwork for improved reporting. Elephants acquire this disease through grazing though they are\nprimarily browsers. Because of the difficulties of controlling\nwildlife anthrax in African national parks, it is a widespread problem\nin the parks. And this presents a threat to livestock grazing in\nproximity to such parks. If I were to guess it would be that this kudu\npaid the price of its curiosity in investigating these elephant\ncarcasses and maybe from consuming some of their extravasated blood. -\nMod.MHJ A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at:\n(http://healthmap.org/promed/p/177).

All 4 dengue serotypes are\npresent this year 2017. A total of 15 samples found to be\nco-infected. In an earlier study done in New Delhi, such multiple\ndengue serotype infections were reported in only 19 per cent of cases.\nAll 4 dengue serotypes were detected in almost equal number in blood\nsamples, unlike in an earlier study conducted in New Delhi wherein one\nserotype was found to be dominating. This has been indicated as a\npossible reason for the high prevalence of infection due to more than\none dengue serotype. Another finding of concern is that DEN-4 strain,\nresembling the one detected in Pune in 2009, was detected in as many\nas 11 samples. DEN-4 is associated with unusual symptoms like\nrespiratory distress, pleural effusion, and elevated levels of liver\nenzymes.

This came about after 2\nkidney recipients in Taiwan were diagnosed with dengue 2 days after\nreceiving a kidney each from the same donor, said National Cheng Kung\nUniversity microbiology and immunology professor Dr Oscar Perng\nGuey-chuen. \"This indicates a potential risk,\" the Taiwan-based\nscientist said, adding that no dengue virus was detected in the\ndonor's blood. He said the donor contracted dengue in 2015 and in mid-2016, he died\nin an accident. His family donated his corneas, liver, heart, and\nkidneys. Both patients had the same strain of the dengue virus the\ndonor had in 2015 and one of the recipients died of dengue\nhaemorrhagic fever, he said. Asked where the virus could be hiding since it could not be detected\nin the blood, he said it was a question scientists are trying to\nanswer. Interestingly, those who received the donor's corneas, liver,\nand heart did not develop dengue, Dr Perng said on the sidelines of\nthe National Dengue And Arboviruses Infection Conference 2017\nyesterday 12 Aug 2017. He said although there was not enough\nevidence to show the virus came from the donor as the kidneys were not\ntested for dengue before the transplant, the same virus was found in\nthe patients' bodies after that. Dr Perng said his team had studied mice for dengue virus in the blood\ntestes, kidney, liver, spleen and brain, and found the virus present\nin the kidneys and brain. \"We believe the virus probably resided in\nthe kidneys and was not cleared by the body,\" he said, adding that the\nvirus could have been activated after transplant. He said this raised\nconcerns about asymptomatic people who are dengue carriers. Health Ministry deputy director, general Datuk Dr S Jeyaindran said\npatients with severe dengue would have better recovery if they were\ngiven colloids, a more concentrated fluid, at the early stage in fluid\nmanagement for dengue patients. Dr Jeyaindran, who was representing\nHealth Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam, said colloids may be\nintroduced at an earlier stage, instead of saline because it has not\nbeen successful in treating patients with severe dengue. He said more\nstudies will be conducted to find out at which stage the colloids\nshould be given. byline: Loh Foon Fong \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) - Air travel related spread of dengue.\nDate: Thu 3 Aug 2017.\nSource: Medical Xpress (edited)\n(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-08-air-responsible-dengue-asia.html) \nWhile the incidences of many other infectious diseases have declined\nover the past decade, the number of cases and outbreaks of dengue\nvirus have continued to increase. The spread of dengue to new areas is\nlikely due in large part to trends in air travel, researchers now\nreport in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Dengue virus affects as estimated 390 million people around the globe\neach year, and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild fever and\nheadache to severe low blood pressure. The virus has mostly caused\ndisease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, but a 2014\noutbreak in Japan broke that pattern. Overall, the geographic area\naffected by dengue has been growing in recent years. In the new work, Huaiyu Tian and Bing Xu, both of Beijing Normal\nUniversity, China, together with colleagues from the University of\nOxford and elsewhere analyzed the spread of dengue viruses in Asia\nfrom 1956 to 2015. They used 2202 genetic sequences of dengue viruses,\ncollected in 20 countries or regions of Asia over the 59 years, to\ndetermine how different strains were related. They also investigated\ntrends in air travel, maritime mobility, migration, and\nsocio-economics to determine what factors impact the spread of\ndengue. The spread of 3 different dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1, -2, and -3,\nis associated with air traffic more so than any other factors, the\ndata revealed. Air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India, the\nresearchers found, help seed dengue epidemics, while China, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, and Singapore help diffuse the virus to other Asian\ncountries. \"Future trends in global mobility could potentially accelerate the\nappearance and diffusion of DENV worldwide,\" the researchers say.\n\"Prevention and control of dengue epidemics requires a better\nunderstanding of its mode of geographic dissemination, especially for\ncountries in the tropics.\" Reference: Tian H, Sun Z, Faria NR, et al.

Date: Fri 18 Aug 2017. From: Sher Bahadur Pun (drsherbdr@yahoo.com) (edited)   As of Tue 15 Aug 2017 (until Aug 18), at least 17 scrub typhus (ST) cases have been found positive among suspected cases who visited the outpatient department of Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH). as well as those who were referred from different hospitals in Kathmandu for laboratory testing. It indicates that ST is becoming more common in Kathmandu than we previously thought. It raises a critical question whether ST is shifting its geographic range or was frequently under-diagnosed previously or was under-diagnosed in urban areas like Kathmandu; this deserves further studies. Because, in the past, the majority of scrub typhus cases were reported from non-urban remote areas than urban areas of Nepal.   <br><br>Communicated by: Dr. Sher Bahadur Pun, MD, PhD Clinical Research Unit, Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal. (drsherbdr@yahoo.com)  ProMED-mail thanks Dr Sher Bahadur Pun for continued contributions to ProMED-mail on scrub typhus in Nepal.  Scrub typhus is caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a rickettsia-like microorganism that is transmitted by chiggers, the larval stage of trombiculid mites, which feed on the skin cells of animals, including humans and rodents. After feeding on their hosts, chiggers drop to the ground and become nymphs, which then mature into adults that feed only on plant materials. The cutaneous reaction to chiggers leaves a characteristic black eschar that is useful for making the diagnosis. Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the infected chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation. Rodents may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_ in nature ((http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol9no12/03-0212.htm)).

Given the\noutbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections in the region, and the\nclinical similarity of cases of that virus infection and CHIKV\ninfection, one wonders how many cases that were not laboratory\nconfirmed but clinically diagnosed as ZIKV infections were, in\nreality, CHIKV infections. It is also possible that a significant\nproportion of the population have been infected by CHIKV in the\nprevious 3 years and are now immune.

The\nfollowing is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In:\nChronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract.\nGreydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in\npress): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons,\nvaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside\nof Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as\n60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection\nlengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:\n- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam;\n- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however,\nhave suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be\neffective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and\noutbreak situations (63, 64). \"References\n\n57.

(promed@promedmail.org)  According to the Nepal page on WRLFMD website, the last occurrence of FMD serotype A in Nepal took place in 1997. Since 2010, and as of March 2017, the FMDV strain circulating in Nepal has continuously been O/ME-SA/Ind-2001d (in 2015, there was also a single detection of O/ME-SA/PanAsia-2 KAT-15). For the said and additional information on Nepal's FMD past records, including genotyping results (though not yet of the newly introduced A/ASIA/G-VII lineage), see (http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/asia/nep.htm).  The identification of the A/ASIA/G-VII lineage in Nepal represents further spread of this virus, which had been evolving in India many years back (\"A/IND/40/2000\", genotyped A/ASIA/G-VII, was collected in 1999). In 2010, this strain was detected in Myanmar. In 2015, it appeared for the 1st time in the Middle East (\"FMD Pool 3\"), being detected in Saudi Arabia followed, during the same year, by Iran, Turkey and Armenia. Most recently (May 2017), this virus was identified in Northern Israel, on the Lebanese and Syrian borders.  According to the information included in the Guest Editor's comments to EuFMD's (European Commission for the control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease) monthly report \"Global Foot-and-Mouth Disease Situation\", June 2017, there were reports of poor performance of vaccine strains derived from the A/ASIA/Iran-05 strain against the A/ASIA/G-VII lineage. The guest editor, Don King (head of the Vesicular Disease Reference Laboratory Group in the Pirbright Institute and WRLFMD), disclosed that WRLFMD, in partnership with the FMD Reference Laboratories in Lelystad (The Netherlands) and Geelong (Australia), has undertaken vaccine potency trials for alternative candidate vaccines; preliminary data indicated that the A-May-97 vaccine may provide protection in cattle, in contrast to the A22 vaccine, which does not appear to induce a protective response. The said data were to \"be presented in more detail shortly\". The said and additional information is available at (http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd/docs/FMD_monthly_reports/2017/June2017.pdf).  The Indian subcontinent (\"FMD Pool 2\") is the source of 2 FMD strains which have demonstrated, in recent years, a long-distance (trans-regional) transmission, causing losses in \"FMD Pool 3\" countries and threatening Europe. These are FMDV serotype O, topotype ME-SA, strain Ind-2001d and FMDV serotype A, topotype Asia, genotype (strain) VII. While the routes of dissemination are yet to be clarified, the FMD situation within India, a major beef exporter, including its vaccination policy and vaccines efficacy, deserves being visited. - Mod.AS  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/19830).

Date: Wed 30 Aug 2017. From: Sher Bahadur Pun (drsherbdr@yahoo.com) (edited)   During a 2-week period (15 through 29 Aug 2017), at least 86 scrub typhus (ST) cases (including 9 children) have been identified by laboratory testing at Sukraraj Tropical & Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH). Majority of these patients are being treated in different hospitals in Kathmandu. 9 children with laboratory confirmed ST received treatment at STIDH and recovered uneventfully.  It is quite surprising for me observing such a large number of ST cases being detected in Kathmandu, the biggest and most densely populated area of Nepal. Because ST has previously been almost exclusively detected in rural areas of Nepal. What is not yet clear is the impact of ST between the years 2004 and 2015. ST was first well documented in 2004 in Kathmandu (1), while the significant number of ST cases has only been detected since 2015.  The widespread use of antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin, could be one possible explanation. In other words, healthcare workers in Nepal usually view any fever as typhoid fever, thus used to treat febrile patients with ciprofloxacin, which might have also worked simultaneously against ST too. However, nowadays, cefixime has become the drug of choice for typhoid fever, and it may, however, not work effectively against ST, resulting in emergence of ST in Nepal.  Reference  1.

Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, MD, PhD Clinical Research Unit Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital Kathmandu Nepal (drsherbdr@yahoo.com)  ProMED-mail thanks Dr Sher Bahadur Pun for his continued contributions on scrub typhus in Nepal.  Doxycycline is the drug of choice and it is preferred over other tetracyclines for treatment of scrub typhus; it is rarely associated with staining of teeth in children younger than 8 years (1). Macrolides, such as azithromycin, are also reported to be efficacious (2). Fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, have been reported to be clinically effective in the treatment of scrub typhus in a few patients. However, some clinical studies suggest that fluoroquinolones are not as effective in patients with scrub typhus as other antibiotics (3,4).  In vitro testing of some strains of _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, the cause of scrub typhus, has been reported to show resistance to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin (minimum inhibitory concentration=8 micrograms/mL) (5) and mutation in the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) of the gyrA gene associated with fluoroquinolone resistance has been found (3,5).  These findings suggest that fluoroquinolones are likely not appropriate for the treatment of scrub typhus.  References - 1. Panpanich R, Garner P. Antibiotics for treating scrub typhus.

But the officials say there is no risk to the public because the parasite that triggers the disease is not present in the territory.  It is not known when and how the _Anopheles_ mosquitoes entered New Caledonia but they are now established in the area of La Tontouta, north of Noumea.  Malaria is found in other parts of Melanesia.  Reports say the mosquitoes were found during checks as part of efforts to fight dengue fever.  Another mosquito type, the _Aedes aegypti_, has been a major health concern in New Caledonia, having spread dengue and Zika viruses.

The 1st locally acquired case of Zika virus infection was reported in mid-January 2014, the number of confirmed cases as of 18 Mar 2014 was 276. Dengue fever has been a frequent problem on New Caledonia. According to the authorities, nearly 5000 cases have been reported since 1 Sep 2016. The peak of the epidemic was reached in March 2017.

The nearest neighbor is Vanuatu, a malaria-endemic country that has but one anopheline species present in that island group, _Anopheles farauti_ sensu stricto, an effective malaria vector provided you add _Plasmodium_ to the mix.  _Anopheles farauti_ is one member of 8 known sibling species in the _Farauti_ Complex (closely related species that are morphologically identical, thus confounding accurate identification without the use of molecular techniques). It is by far the most widely distributed species in the complex in the southwest Pacific region (Maluku island group, eastern Indonesia to northern Australia, PNG, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu). The species' ability to inhabit brackish water environments (predominantly a coastal inhabitant) has aided in its dispersal throughout the region.  The origin of the anopheline population in New Caledonia might remain a mystery, but this discovery is of concern. If the area of establishment is relatively confined, it might be possible to eliminate this species before it extends further into the country. Foremost, identify the species.   Michael J.

There have been 14 cases of the highly infectious disease identified by Queensland Health since 24 Jul 2017, compared to the yearly average of only one case in the Cairns and Hinterland health district.  Tropical Public Health director Dr Steven Donohue said the mumps outbreak had spilled over to Cairns from northwest Queensland and the Northern Territory's Top End.  \"Outbreaks of mumps mainly occur because of low vaccination rates, missed doses in the past, waning immunity, or pressure of infection in overcrowded households,\" he said.  He said the viral illness was spread just like influenza, by coughing or sneezing near other people and through unwashed hands.  \"Symptoms may occur around 2 weeks after exposure if the person is not immune,\" he said. \"The illness usually lasts between 5-9 days.  \"One person in 3 who contracts mumps does not have any symptoms and doesn't realise they are sick, but they may still be contagious and infect may other people.\"  Northern Queensland Primary Health Network chief executive Robin Moore said immunisation was a simple, safe and highly effective way to protect children and adults from preventable diseases like mumps.  \"This year's 2017 increase in the number of mumps cases in the Cairns region is a timely reminder to parents that immunisation is the best protection against preventable diseases such as these.  \"We urge all members of the community to be fully vaccinated.\" ..  The disease is uncommon in developed countries, including Australia, because of the widespread use of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine.  This is given to children at 12 and 18 months, but free catch-up doses are available to anyone born after 1965 who may not have 2 recorded doses.

Three young people in Marlborough have contracted the contagious illness, with at least 1 case linked to an Auckland outbreak, while 2 have been confirmed in Nelson.  Nationally, an unusually high number of cases were reported from September 2016 to early 2017, and the Ministry of Health warned of \"an increased risk of further outbreaks\".  Auckland reported 51 cases of mumps in the past month  most aged 10 to 19  while several were recorded in Waikato earlier this year 2017.  The Auckland Regional Public Health Service said last month July 2017 it was concerned not enough people were immunised in the face of the mumps outbreak.  The MMR vaccine is usually given in 2 doses, one at 15 months old and one at 4 years old.  Most people recover from mumps, but it can have serious complications. The disease can cause inflammation of tissue surrounding the brain (meningitis), inflamed testicles or ovaries and deafness.  Men hospitalised from the Auckland outbreak had pain and swelling in their testicles, known as orchitis, which in rare cases may lead to infertility.  The outbreak in Dunedin has prompted the Otago tertiary institution's student health team to offer free measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) booster shots to students who have not had two MMR vaccinations since 1990, or are unsure of their vaccination history.  Pro-vice-chancellor of health sciences Professor Peter Crampton, the convener of the university's pandemic planning group, said the group was \"determining our ongoing response as the situation develops.\"  The outbreak coincided with a large-scale boil water notice issued for parts of Dunedin, including the student quarter, after untreated water got into part of the town's drinking water supply on Mon 14 Aug 2017.  All students and staff had been sent information about mumps. Information had been posted on social media.  Marlborough medical officer of health Dr Andrew Lindsay said mumps is \"highly contagious\". It spreads through the air by breathing, coughing and sneezing, or through contact with infected saliva; by kissing or sharing food and drink. It usually takes 12-25 days before symptoms appear  including pain in the jaw, fever, headache, and swollen glands around the face and body. People with mumps re infectious for 7 days before swelling starts and for 5 days after they cease.  Personal hygiene is essential to avoid catching mumps, including frequent hand washing, stopping coughs and sneezes in tissues, keeping at least 1 metre 3 ft away from others and ensuring kitchens and bathrooms are clean.  Dr Jill Sherwood, public health physician with the ESR (the Institute of Environmental Science and Research), earlier said the MMR vaccine was not as effective in mumps as it was in measles and rubella. \"The mumps component is only about 85 per cent effective, whereas the measles component will most likely give you lifetime coverage,\" Sherwood said.  There have been no reported cases of mumps in Canterbury, a health board spokeswoman said.

Up to 2016, there were no official mumps outbreak records in Manaus. In 2017, as of 18 Aug, there have been 230 cases reported from 19 localities, most of them in schools, which suggests low vaccination coverage in children and adolescents. The 1st outbreak was reported in April 2017 and the occurrence of cases is continuing until the month of August, according to the municipal health secretary. ..

Source: The Business Times (edited) (http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/consumer/3-more-nz-farms-test-positive-for-cattle-disease)   A serious bacterial cattle disease has been identified at 3 more farms in New Zealand, raising the number of affected farms to 6, the country's Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) said on Tue 29 Aug 2017.  Two of the farms that reported positive results for the _Mycoplasma bovis_ disease belong to the Van Leeuwen Dairy Group, which also owns the 1st 2 farms to report the bacteria in July 2017.  The owner of the 3rd unnamed farm in the country's South Island had received a small number of calves from another infected farm, the ministry said in an emailed statement. \"We fully expect to find more infected properties as we continue our tracing and testing programme,\" MPI Response Coordinator David Yard said, adding that there was no evidence the disease was spreading without close contact to infected animals.  _Mycoplasma bovis_ is common in many countries and can lead to conditions such as udder infection, pneumonia, and arthritis in affected cattle, but does not pose a food safety risk or any risk to humans.  News of the outbreak in July 2017 briefly knocked the New Zealand currency given the importance of the cattle industry to the economy, with dairy the country's largest export good.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  We know the MPI is investigating how this pathogen got into the country. This particular pathogen causes a variety of clinical signs from respiratory, to arthritis, and mastitis and can be difficult to diagnose. It can be an aggressive pathogen, therefore it is not unexpected that MPI has found, and expects to find more cases of this disease. - Mod.TG  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/164).

Once again, ProMED-mail thanks Dr Olutayo Olajide Babalobi for sending in the Epidemiological Report above.  As noted in earlier comments, Lassa fever remains a problem in Nigeria because the virus is endemic there. Virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or their excreta. Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients.  Images of mastomys mice, the rodent reservoir of Lass fever virus, can be seen at (http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877).

Five districts in 3 governorates are now infected.  The total number of cVDPV2 cases is 33 (this includes the previously reported 29 cases from Mayadeen district, Deir ez-Zor governorate, and 1 case from Tell Abyad district, Raqqa governorate). All confirmed cases to date have had onset of paralysis before 11 Jul 2017.  Final lab results for an additional 9 poliovirus type-2 (PV2) isolates from Deir ez-Zor are pending.  Discussions around expanding the scope of the immunization response to include accessible areas of a Tadmour sub-district in Homs, bordering Deir ez-Zor , will be held in light of the confirmation of the cases in this area.  Raqqa governorate commenced its 1st immunization round on 12 Aug 2017 (Raqqa and Thawra districts) and 13 Aug 2017 (Tell Abyad district). The immunization round aims to reach 120 000 children under 5 years of age. Preliminary information suggests the rounds are reaching children in all 3 districts.  Preparations continue for the 2nd round in Deir ez-Zor governorate, scheduled for 19-23 Aug 2017. IPV inactivated polio vaccine for use in the 2nd rounds in Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa governorates has arrived in Damascus.  The total number of AFP acute flaccid paralysis cases detected in Deir ez-Zor governorate since the beginning of 2017 is 113 (83 from Mayadeen, 11 from Deir ez-Zor, and 19 from Boukamal districts). Raqqa governorate has reported 16 AFP cases (5 from Raqqa, 10 from Tell Abyad, and 1 from Thawra districts). Homs governorate has reported 26 AFP cases (11 from Homs city, 12 from Rastan, 1 from Tadmour, and 2 from Talkalakh districts).  The Eradication and Outbreak Management Group (EOMG) has approved the release of additional doses of IPV to cover high risk population groups in northwest Syria, Turkey, and Lebanon. Lebanon requested 144 000 doses and has begun to implement IPV campaigns across the country.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Unfortunately transmission of the cVDPV2 in Syria has continued. With each report, the date of onset of the most recent case shifts to a date approximately one month preceding the report, probably reflecting the time it takes from specimen collection to appropriate reference laboratory. We are fairly sure there will be an additional 9 cases confirmed from Deir ez-Zor, as the report above mentions that there are 9 poliovirus isolates pending typing (WPV vs cVDPV). The report also mentions a significant number of AFP cases identified in the 3 governorates, suggesting there may be more cases in the pipeline for confirmation. The control activities have been implemented during this week and will be implemented in additional areas next week week of 21 Aug 2017, so hopefully there will be interruption of transmission going forward.  The disturbing news in the situation report above, is that there is now involvement of 3 governorates. Deir ez-Zor, Raqqa, and now Homs. On a map of Syria showing provinces/governorates ((http://www.freeworldmaps.net/asia/syria/syria-political-map.jpg)), one can see that Deir ez-Zor, the main governorate involved in this outbreak is located in the northeast of the country sharing it's eastern border with Iraq. It shares a southern border with Homs, and a western border with Raqqa (Ar-Raqqah on this map) governorate. Hopefully the cVDPV2 will not continue to travel in the country outside of the currently 3 affected areas. - Mod.MPP   <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Somalia: declared polio free. Date: Mon 14 Aug 2017. Source: AllAfrica, Shabelle Media Network (Mogadishu) report (edited) (http://allafrica.com/stories/201708150227.html)   The UN World Health Organisation (WHO) said it had not recorded any case of polio disease in Somalia in the last 3 years, declaring the country polio free.  The WHO said the country recorded the last case of polio in 2014 in the central part of the country but has since then remained free of the paralyzing disease.  The UN health agency, however, warned Somalia remained vulnerable, calling for continued vaccination campaign, Xinhua News Agency reported.  The head of the WHO Eastern Mediterranean, which covers Somalia, Mohamed Fiqi said that massive vaccination campaigns and commitment from government and international actors had ensured the polio virus did not recur in the Horn of Africa country.  \"As the world edges closer to eradicating polio, keeping alert in countries that have high risk of polio importation like Somalia is more of priority than ever,\" Fiqi said.  \"As we move forward, the polio programme in Somalia needs to continue to work to maintain and improve the level of population immunity against polio through target vaccination campaign and strengthening of the routine immunisation services and infrastructure,\" Fiqi added.  The declaration by WHO keeps Somalia outside the last group of countries which still record cases of polio in the world.  Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan are the remaining countries where polio is still being recorded. The WHO chief warned Somalia remains at risk of importation of the virus from these countries.  Somalia President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo praised efforts to rid his country of the polio disease which he noted had subjected many children into suffering.  \"No cases were found for the past 3 years and no child was affected by this disease. Many of our children have suffered from polio for many years.  \"To eradicate polio was a big success and it was collective effort and commitment by many young men and women who sacrificed their lives,\" Farmaajo noted.  The 3 year polio-free celebration comes amidst the worst outbreak of measles the country has seen in years.  Somalia is also still responding to an outbreak of acute watery diarrhoea/cholera, which began in January 2017. Polio systems and networks are being used in both interventions.  \"Polio infrastructure has been critical in responding to these other serious outbreaks,\" said Fiqi.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  Achieving 3 years with no new cases of polio reported is a significant achievement for Somalia. That being said, it's important to remember that this too is a country with internal civil strife and warring factions, which may impede the identification of poliovirus associated disease either due to infrastructural challenges in good specimen collection and transport, or access of the population to the healthcare infrastructure. A reminder is the identification of WPV associated cases in Borno, Nigeria last year (2016), involving a virus last seen 5 years before in the same state.

We continue to work together to advance shared priorities, including governance and democracy, regional security, poverty reduction, polio eradication, trade, defense, and the fight against climate change.\"  - The 14th Emergency Committee for polio eradication under the International Health Regulations met on 3 Aug 2017 and has made its recommendations to the WHO Director-General, who has accepted them. The Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and recommended the extension of revised Temporary Recommendations for a further 3 months. The key change is the inclusion of DR Congo and Syria in the category 'States infected with cVDPV2s, with potential risk of international spread'.  - Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: Afghanistan: 1 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case; Pakistan: 1 new WPV1-positive environmental sample; Syrian Arab Republic: 3 new circulating vaccine-derived polio type 2 (cVDPV2) from Syria, 2 from Deir ez-Zor and 1 from Homs governorates. Details in country-specific sections below.  Afghanistan  - One new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week, bringing the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 to 6. It is the most recent case in the country, and had onset of paralysis on 10 Jul 2017, from Zabul province, neighbouring Kandahar province and Pakistan. - Afghanistan continues to coordinate activities with neighbouring Pakistan, to address both cross-border transmission and focus on reaching mobile populations with oral polio vaccine (OPV). Transmission linking both countries runs primarily across 3 corridors, namely: eastern Afghanistan and Khyber-Peshawar, Pakistan; greater Kandahar/Helmand and Quetta, Pakistan; and, Paktika/Patkya/Khost and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa/Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Pakistan.  Pakistan  - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week; the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 3. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 11 Jun 2017, from Killa Abdullah, Balochistan. - 1 new WPV1-positive environmental sample was reported in the past week, collected on 28 Jul 2017, from Quetta, Balochistan. - A special vaccination round is being implemented during August 2017 targeting areas with recent polio cases and positive environmental samples. These include Rawalpindi/Islamabad and demographically connected areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Quetta Block, and parts of Karachi. - Under the National Emergency Action Plan for polio eradication, the country is planning to implement 2 nation-wide and 2 sub-national vaccination rounds from September to December 2017.  Nigeria - - No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 21 Aug 2016 in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno. - Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016). - Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance.  Lake Chad Basin  - The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno, Nigeria in 2016) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) (Borno and Sokoto provinces in Nigeria in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak. - Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.  Central Africa  - No new cases of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). The total number of cVDPV2 cases this year 2017 remains 7, in 2 separate outbreaks: in Haut Lomami province (5 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on 13 Jun 2017); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on 26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017, with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May 2017). - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time. Outbreak response is taking place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols, targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 across the 2 provinces. - The 1st mOPV2 round was implemented on 27-29 Jun 2017 in the 2 affected provinces; and the 2nd mOPV2 round ran from 13-15 Jul 2017 in Haut Lomami and 20-22 Jul 2017 in Maniema. - Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.  Middle East  - In Syria, 3 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were officially reported in the past week. The total number of cases in this outbreak is 33. Onset of paralysis of these cases is between 3 Mar 2017 and 10 Jul 2017. 31 of the cases are from Deir ez-Zor governorate (29 from Mayadeen district, one from Deir ez-Zor district, and one from Boukamal district); 1 case is from Talabyad district, Raqqa governorate; and, 1 is from Tadmour district in Homs governorate. - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized and implemented, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Two vaccination campaigns are planned for both Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa governorates. If there is geographic spread, the extent of these campaigns will have to be adjusted. - The 1st mOPV2 round in Deir ez-Zor was successfully carried out between 22-26 Jul 2017. Independent post-campaign monitoring reflected coverage of 88.4 percent (based on caregiver recall). The 2nd round is planned for 19-23 Aug 2017, and will include mOPV2 and IPV. - Raqqa Governorate started mOPV2 campaigns on 12 Aug 2017. - Plans are being finalized to mitigate the risks of further spread from the outbreak zone to neighbouring areas and countries, including immunization of at-risk populations in northwest Syria, Turkey and Lebanon. Following confirmation of the case in Homs, discussions are ongoing to further extend the geographic reach of the outbreak response.

(promed@promedmail.org)  This week's global update is similar to prior weeks in terms of low level identification of WPV1 associated disease (a single case confirmed in Afghanistan this past week), one positive WPV1 isolated from an environmental sample in Pakistan, and 3 newly confirmed cVDPV2 associated cases in Syria.  That being said, there have only been 9 confirmed cases of WPV1 associated paralytic disease worldwide this year (2017), compared with 37 cases reported last year (2016). In contrast there have been 40 confirmed cases of cVDPV2 confirmed this year (2017) compared with 5 last year (2016). As a reminder, outbreaks due to cVDPV's are considered as significant in the big picture of polio eradication, as they are due to vaccine polioviruses that have reverted in neurovirulence following passage through multiple individuals while circulating in the susceptible population. The goal of the polio eradication initiative is to interrupt transmission of both the WPV's and the cVDPVs. The presence of cVDPVs occurs when there are areas with low vaccination coverage where the vaccine virus (from the OPV) can continue circulating through the susceptible population.

While speaking with newsmen in Lokoja, Audu said those diagnosed were suffering from gastroenteritis and malaria. \"The current information available to us is that the strange disease actually started 6 weeks ago in Okoloke village in Yagba West, which is a settlement that is predominantly inhabited by Fulani herdsmen.  \"There have been cases of reported deaths following abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea, but the patients who showed signs of illness had since been evacuated and transported to Kogi State Specialist Hospital, Lokoja for better treatment. So far, we have evacuated 39 patients from Okoloke area and only 6 of them were admitted and have shown significant sign of improvement while others have since been discharged.  \"Out of the 6 that were admitted, 3 of them were diagnosed of gastroenteritis and the remaining 3 were just cases of malaria, and they have shown remarkable signs of improvement,\" Audu said. He also stressed that the disease was not Lassa fever, saying the result of samples taken from the patients to Irua General Hospital for investigation proved negative. \"We will investigate and trace the dead people to the grave yard and come up with the correct figure.  \"We want to assure the general public that government is doing all that is humanly possible to stay on top of the situation and forestall further loss of lives.

The state Commissioner for Health, Dr Saka Audu, told Channels Television that so far, 62 people have been killed by the illness which was initially thought to have been Lassa fever by many people. This is because it has some symptoms that are similar to Lassa fever such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vomiting. The worst hit community is Okoloke in Yagba West Local Government Area of the state. Other areas are Okunran and Isanlu-Esa - both villages in Yagba West LGA.  With over 60 people dead and Lassa fever ruled out as a cause, the government has taken samples of the disease and is hoping to identify the illness as quickly as possible to prevent more deaths, according to the commissioner.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  There is some disagreement regarding the numbers occurring in this outbreak and it is not stated in the posting how many individuals overall became ill so it can be ascertained the approximate case-fatality rate, which can be helpful in the development of a differential diagnosis. It is also not specifically stated if the individuals were febrile or not, had any hemorrhagic features, over what period the illnesses occurred and if there was evidence of person-to-person spread. Gastrointestinal symptoms can be non-specific and reflect a more systemic illness such as malaria or meningitis. Indeed, the initially undiagnosed outbreak this year 2017 in Liberia was eventually confirmed to be meningococcal meningitis. Non-infectious etiologies include poisonings or biological toxins.

The state Commissioner for Health, Mr. Atolagbe Alege, who disclosed this yesterday Fri 18 Aug 2017 in Ilorin said the alert became necessary in view of the outcome of the results of the samples taken to Virology Department of Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), for verification.  Alege, however, said there was no cause for alarm, said the state government had procured necessary drugs and other medications to prevent the disease from spreading.  Meanwhile, a new Lassa fever case was identified last Thu 17 Aug 2017 at LUTH among the doctors, who 1st had close contact with the index case, while 65 others are still under watch. Disclosing this while giving an update on the Lassa fever cases at the hospital, the Chief Medical Director, Prof Chris Bode, said the patient, a female, had already commenced treatment and is expected to recover fully very soon.  Bode, who noted that psychological and other supports had also been provided, added that her family contacts were closely being monitored. He also said that 70 of the contacts being followed up had also been let off, having completed their period of observation.  \"Last week, we reported the deaths of 2 patients who had been brought to the Lagos University Teaching Hospital and were later diagnosed with Lassa fever. \"Three doctors who closely attended to the 1st patient later tested positive for the disease and were admitted while 135 other contacts have been followed up.\" The 3 doctors admitted with confirmed Lassa Fever in LUTH have all been certified fit and discharged home because subsequent repeated tests on them showed they have now tested negative for Lassa and no longer harbour the disease,\" the CMD noted.  Meanwhile over 400 LUTH staff attended a grand round on Viral Hemorrhagic Fever on Fri 18 Aug 2017 at which various aspects of the contagious ailment were discussed.  \"The importance of a high-index of suspicion, early diagnosis and referral were highlighted to medical workers who were also enjoined to observe universal precautions while attending to any patient who may be suspected of having Lassa fever.  \"There is a fully equipped response squad available round the clock to assess and take over the management of any suspected cases in LUTH.

Transmission of Lassa fever virus in hospitals has been a long-term problem in Nigeria. One hopes that the above situations will result in putting these preventive measures into practice constantly.  There is no indication of the circumstances under which the index case from Kwara state acquired the infection. Virus transmission to humans can occur when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or their excreta.

Nigeria accounts for 61 per cent of yam production in the world.  \"Seed yam is a big problem,\" said Robert Aseidu, International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA). \"It's only now that we're seeing how big a problem this could become.\" Due to many years of flawed farm practice, most seed yams have disease. Farmers traditionally keep back the measlier poorer. - Mod.SH yams for planting. \"They keep accumulating diseases and productivity keeps reducing until you get to a stage where it's no longer economical to plant,\" says Beatrice Aighewi, IITA.  Some scientists have seen the urgent need and high demand for disease free seed yams. Aighewi says the solution to Nigeria's seed yam crisis is large-scale aeroponic seed yam production. She also produces high-yielding and disease-resistant yam varieties.  byline: Uwagbale Edward-Ekpu   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  Yam (_Dioscorea_ spp.) is an important tuber crop in Africa, the West Indies and parts of Asia and southern America. A number of fungal (anthracnose, leaf blight, tuber rots), bacterial (pre- and post-harvest wet rots), viral (mosaic, 'shoe-string') and nematode (dry rot) diseases or disease complexes are known to affect the crop. Many of these have been reported from West Africa, including Nigeria (see links below).  For predominantly vegetatively propagated crops, including root and tuber crops like yam, potato, taro and cassava, accumulation of multiple viral and other pathogens over successive planting cycles is a high risk. Even low levels of seed tuber infections pose a major risk of both horizontal and vertical pathogen spread. A build up of both numbers and individual levels of pathogens over the planting cycles will eventually lead to weaker and weaker crops, as described above for yams. To return to viable crop production, exclusive use of planting material that was certified, preferably by molecular methods, as being free of pathogens is essential for each crop cycle.  Farm saved or other uncertified propagating materials (including seeds, budwood, rootstocks, seed tubers, cuttings) have often been reported as sources of crop disease outbreaks worldwide. Clean planting stock is vital for successful agricultural systems and, consequently, certification schemes have been set up for relevant crops in many countries.  In aeroponic systems, as mentioned above, plants are grown in a mist environment, without a medium to support their roots. This differs from hydroponics, where plant roots are immersed in a liquid nutrient solution. In both systems, disease (and pest) control is aided by the absence of soil and minimal requirements for handling the plants during growth.

(promed@promedmail.org)  In the above global summary, there is still identified transmission ongoing in Pakistan as seen by the positive environmental sample in Karachi as well as the early report on a case of WPV1 associated disease in Karachi. It will be interesting to learn of the genetic profile of the environmental isolates in Karachi (from this past week as well as from a few weeks ago) and compare them with the newly identified WPV1 associated case in Karachi to see if they are genetically related.  There has been more activity associated with cVDPV2 in both Syria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), with 6 newly confirmed cases in Syria and 1 newly confirmed case in the DR Congo. According to the Situation Report in section <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> above, there are still 5 additional PV2 (poliovirus type 2) isolates in Syria undergoing final testing  4 from Deir al Zour and 1 from Raqqa. Hence there will probably be more cases confirmed in the coming days or weeks. I have not been able to identify similar report information from the DR Congo outbreak so it is not clear if the transmission has been interrupted leaving a total of 8 cases, or if there are still probable cases pending confirmation.

The event was declared open on the 1st day by the Honourable Minister of State for Heath, Dr Osagie Enahire, who applauded the NCDC for its efforts towards stemming the tides of Lassa fever in Nigeria and charged all present to find a lasting solution to the menace of the disease in the country. The chairperson of the National Steering Committee, Prof Oyewale Tomori gave an overview of Lassa fever outbreak since the virus was discovered in 1969 with a critical review of control efforts taken in the past which have not yielded needed results. He decried the unsustainable efforts that have plagued the surveillance system in Nigeria and called on every stakeholder to realign their activities to achieve a common goal of a strengthened surveillance system, which can be used as a strong tool in the fight against Lassa fever. He urged participants present to focus on finding practical solutions towards elimination of the disease.  A national report of the 2016/2017 Lassa fever outbreak was presented. As at epi-week 33 (14-20 Aug 2017), a total of 764 suspected cases have been reported across 19 states (Ogun, Taraba, Rivers, Nasarawa, Edo, Ondo, Bauchi, Ebonyi, Plateau, Kaduna, Gombe, Cross-River, Borno, Kano, Kogi, Enugu, Anambra, Lagos, and Kwara). 247 of these cases were confirmed and 14 classified as probable cases. A total of 83 deaths have been recorded, with 69 of them in confirmed cases. Case fatality rate is 33.6 percent in confirmed and probable cases and 15.1 percent in all cases (confirmed, probable, and suspected). The response activities carried out by the NCDC, including the development of Viral Haemorrhagic Fever VHF guidelines, deployment of rapid response teams, provision of ribavirin and other medical supplies to states and several others, were also discussed.  Robust discussions were held by the participants following various presentations made, which all focused on preparedness and response to Lassa fever outbreak. The 2-day meeting provided an opportunity to reflect on the events which led to the 2016/2017 Lassa fever outbreak in each state and also to conduct out a detailed review of the response activities carried out by the affected States and the NCDC. In addition, gaps in preparedness, response and surveillance activities were highlighted and pragmatic steps to be taken to bridge these gaps were proposed.  Working groups were created in line with the 6 thematic areas under the incident management system (IMS) for Lassa fever  coordination/case management/infection prevention and control, laboratory, logistics, surveillance/data management and risk communication. Focus group discussions were held within these working groups during which best practises and challenges in the 2016/2017 Lassa fever outbreak were highlighted. Practical recommendations were made by every group in their individual thematic areas and in cross-cutting areas. Each state was enjoined to follow up with these recommendations, as it applies to their particular needs and circumstances and to also incorporate them in their state-specific Lassa fever preparedness work plan.  The NCDC affirmed its resolve to continue to ensure that the disease burden caused by Lassa fever, and indeed all epidemic-prone diseases in Nigeria is reduced. The steps taken at this meeting will serve as added incentives towards establishing a finish line for the scourge of Lassa fever. All stakeholders and the general public are called upon to work with the governments in the various States towards a collaborative plan for the control and elimination of Lassa fever.   1.

Once again, ProMED-mail thanks Dr Olutayo Olajide Babalobi for sending in the epidemiological report above.  As noted in earlier comments, Lassa fever remains a problem in Nigeria because the virus is endemic there. Virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or their excreta. Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients.  Images of mastomys mice, the rodent reservoir of Lass fever virus, can be seen at (http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877).

On Sun 3 Sep 2017, some 59 officers were hospitalised in various\nhospitals in Nairobi with another 36 admitted Mon 4 Sep 2017, after\ncontracting the disease. They were part of a group of 430 officers\ndeployed to Nairobi ahead of the Supreme Court ruling on presidential\npoll petition on Fri 1 Sep 2017. They were residing at the\nMultimedia University Hotel in Rongai, about 17 kilometers 10.6 mi\nsouth of the capital. \"Those infected did not get the disease from the Multimedia University\nsince they had their lunch away from the institution.

The Health Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu said the officers were in\nstable condition. Dr Mailu said investigations were underway to\nestablish whether the canteen had outsourced services to cater for the\nlarge number of officers. He said the ministry was concerned that\ninstead of eliminating cholera, new cases were emerging. Nairobi was first hit by the outbreak on 19 May 2017, with 56 cases\nhaving been reported. One of the police officers who requested anonymity said they ate ugali\n(a Kenyan staple made of maize flour) and meat stew at the canteen on\nSat 2 Sep 2017.

NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in\npress): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons,\nvaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside\nof Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as\n60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection\nlengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:\n- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam;\n- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses.

Authorities are not ruling out the possibility that the 8 individuals contracted hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), widely known as \"hamburger disease,\" a bacterial infection that can leave the renal system severely damaged. Many cases are caused by _E. coli_, which can be found in undercooked meat like hamburgers. Children under the age of 5 are particularly vulnerable. On 25 Aug 2017, a group of 15 adults and elementary school students from the same church in Jeonju visited McDonald's Jeonju branch and ate bulgogi burgers together. A day later, 7 children and 1 adult experienced diarrhea and vomiting. The authorities declared an epidemiological probe into the case on Sat 2 Sep 2017.  As the case was publicized, McDonald's Korea halted selling bulgogi burgers nationwide starting on Sat 2 Sep 2017. On its website, a notice says, \"We have decided to stop selling bulgogi burgers pending the outcome of the ongoing investigation by authorities,\" adding that the multinational company's Korean branch was taking the issue seriously. It also said the company will do its best to help patients recover, though without elaborating on how or when.  The outcome of the ongoing probe is expected to be made public around Wed 6 Sep 2017.  The case in Jeonju is not the only incident that the corporation, which has 440 branches in Korea alone, has recently found itself in. In July 2017, the mother of a 5-year-old girl filed a complaint claiming irreparable harm was done to her child because of the fast food chain's mismanagement of its food products. The mother, claimed her daughter contracted HUS after eating a Happy Meal in September 2016, and she now must undergo peritoneal dialysis on a daily basis.  McDonald's Korea branch also received a complaint from the parents of a 2-year-old girl, who began to have diarrhea and bloody excrement after eating a hamburger patty on 17 May 2017 at a Jamsil branch in southern Seoul. On 19 May 2017, the child was admitted to a local emergency room. The child's condition improved and she was discharged later that day.  Byline: Kang Jin-kyu   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Whether this cluster of illnesses is caused by enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ is unknown as yet and ProMED would appreciate more information about the illnesses. A one day incubation period is short for EHEC but the outbreak is occurring in the wake of several cases of EHEC linked to the chain in South Korea.  Classic bulgogi recipes use a marinade of soy, ginger, garlic, and gochujang (Korean chili paste) to flavor and tenderize strips of meat. Because combining a marinade into ground beef would change the consistency of the hamburger, making it more of a \"sloppy-joe\", usually a bulgogi inspired sauce is used on top of the burger although a Korean inspired spice combination can be added to the ground beef.

Five districts in 3 governorates are now infected.  The total number of cVDPV2 cases is 33 (this includes the previously reported 29 cases from Mayadeen district, Deir ez-Zor governorate, and 1 case from Tell Abyad district, Raqqa governorate). All confirmed cases to date have had onset of paralysis before 11 Jul 2017.  Final lab results for an additional 9 poliovirus type-2 (PV2) isolates from Deir ez-Zor are pending.  Discussions around expanding the scope of the immunization response to include accessible areas of a Tadmour sub-district in Homs, bordering Deir ez-Zor , will be held in light of the confirmation of the cases in this area.  Raqqa governorate commenced its 1st immunization round on 12 Aug 2017 (Raqqa and Thawra districts) and 13 Aug 2017 (Tell Abyad district). The immunization round aims to reach 120 000 children under 5 years of age. Preliminary information suggests the rounds are reaching children in all 3 districts.  Preparations continue for the 2nd round in Deir ez-Zor governorate, scheduled for 19-23 Aug 2017. IPV inactivated polio vaccine for use in the 2nd rounds in Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa governorates has arrived in Damascus.  The total number of AFP acute flaccid paralysis cases detected in Deir ez-Zor governorate since the beginning of 2017 is 113 (83 from Mayadeen, 11 from Deir ez-Zor, and 19 from Boukamal districts). Raqqa governorate has reported 16 AFP cases (5 from Raqqa, 10 from Tell Abyad, and 1 from Thawra districts). Homs governorate has reported 26 AFP cases (11 from Homs city, 12 from Rastan, 1 from Tadmour, and 2 from Talkalakh districts).  The Eradication and Outbreak Management Group (EOMG) has approved the release of additional doses of IPV to cover high risk population groups in northwest Syria, Turkey, and Lebanon. Lebanon requested 144 000 doses and has begun to implement IPV campaigns across the country.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Unfortunately transmission of the cVDPV2 in Syria has continued. With each report, the date of onset of the most recent case shifts to a date approximately one month preceding the report, probably reflecting the time it takes from specimen collection to appropriate reference laboratory. We are fairly sure there will be an additional 9 cases confirmed from Deir ez-Zor, as the report above mentions that there are 9 poliovirus isolates pending typing (WPV vs cVDPV). The report also mentions a significant number of AFP cases identified in the 3 governorates, suggesting there may be more cases in the pipeline for confirmation. The control activities have been implemented during this week and will be implemented in additional areas next week week of 21 Aug 2017, so hopefully there will be interruption of transmission going forward.  The disturbing news in the situation report above, is that there is now involvement of 3 governorates. Deir ez-Zor, Raqqa, and now Homs. On a map of Syria showing provinces/governorates ((http://www.freeworldmaps.net/asia/syria/syria-political-map.jpg)), one can see that Deir ez-Zor, the main governorate involved in this outbreak is located in the northeast of the country sharing it's eastern border with Iraq. It shares a southern border with Homs, and a western border with Raqqa (Ar-Raqqah on this map) governorate. Hopefully the cVDPV2 will not continue to travel in the country outside of the currently 3 affected areas. - Mod.MPP   <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Somalia: declared polio free. Date: Mon 14 Aug 2017. Source: AllAfrica, Shabelle Media Network (Mogadishu) report (edited) (http://allafrica.com/stories/201708150227.html)   The UN World Health Organisation (WHO) said it had not recorded any case of polio disease in Somalia in the last 3 years, declaring the country polio free.  The WHO said the country recorded the last case of polio in 2014 in the central part of the country but has since then remained free of the paralyzing disease.  The UN health agency, however, warned Somalia remained vulnerable, calling for continued vaccination campaign, Xinhua News Agency reported.  The head of the WHO Eastern Mediterranean, which covers Somalia, Mohamed Fiqi said that massive vaccination campaigns and commitment from government and international actors had ensured the polio virus did not recur in the Horn of Africa country.  \"As the world edges closer to eradicating polio, keeping alert in countries that have high risk of polio importation like Somalia is more of priority than ever,\" Fiqi said.  \"As we move forward, the polio programme in Somalia needs to continue to work to maintain and improve the level of population immunity against polio through target vaccination campaign and strengthening of the routine immunisation services and infrastructure,\" Fiqi added.  The declaration by WHO keeps Somalia outside the last group of countries which still record cases of polio in the world.  Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan are the remaining countries where polio is still being recorded. The WHO chief warned Somalia remains at risk of importation of the virus from these countries.  Somalia President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo praised efforts to rid his country of the polio disease which he noted had subjected many children into suffering.  \"No cases were found for the past 3 years and no child was affected by this disease. Many of our children have suffered from polio for many years.  \"To eradicate polio was a big success and it was collective effort and commitment by many young men and women who sacrificed their lives,\" Farmaajo noted.  The 3 year polio-free celebration comes amidst the worst outbreak of measles the country has seen in years.  Somalia is also still responding to an outbreak of acute watery diarrhoea/cholera, which began in January 2017. Polio systems and networks are being used in both interventions.  \"Polio infrastructure has been critical in responding to these other serious outbreaks,\" said Fiqi.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  Achieving 3 years with no new cases of polio reported is a significant achievement for Somalia. That being said, it's important to remember that this too is a country with internal civil strife and warring factions, which may impede the identification of poliovirus associated disease either due to infrastructural challenges in good specimen collection and transport, or access of the population to the healthcare infrastructure. A reminder is the identification of WPV associated cases in Borno, Nigeria last year (2016), involving a virus last seen 5 years before in the same state.

We continue to work together to advance shared priorities, including governance and democracy, regional security, poverty reduction, polio eradication, trade, defense, and the fight against climate change.\"  - The 14th Emergency Committee for polio eradication under the International Health Regulations met on 3 Aug 2017 and has made its recommendations to the WHO Director-General, who has accepted them. The Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and recommended the extension of revised Temporary Recommendations for a further 3 months. The key change is the inclusion of DR Congo and Syria in the category 'States infected with cVDPV2s, with potential risk of international spread'.  - Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: Afghanistan: 1 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case; Pakistan: 1 new WPV1-positive environmental sample; Syrian Arab Republic: 3 new circulating vaccine-derived polio type 2 (cVDPV2) from Syria, 2 from Deir ez-Zor and 1 from Homs governorates. Details in country-specific sections below.  Afghanistan  - One new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week, bringing the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 to 6. It is the most recent case in the country, and had onset of paralysis on 10 Jul 2017, from Zabul province, neighbouring Kandahar province and Pakistan. - Afghanistan continues to coordinate activities with neighbouring Pakistan, to address both cross-border transmission and focus on reaching mobile populations with oral polio vaccine (OPV). Transmission linking both countries runs primarily across 3 corridors, namely: eastern Afghanistan and Khyber-Peshawar, Pakistan; greater Kandahar/Helmand and Quetta, Pakistan; and, Paktika/Patkya/Khost and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa/Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Pakistan.  Pakistan  - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week; the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 3. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 11 Jun 2017, from Killa Abdullah, Balochistan. - 1 new WPV1-positive environmental sample was reported in the past week, collected on 28 Jul 2017, from Quetta, Balochistan. - A special vaccination round is being implemented during August 2017 targeting areas with recent polio cases and positive environmental samples. These include Rawalpindi/Islamabad and demographically connected areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Quetta Block, and parts of Karachi. - Under the National Emergency Action Plan for polio eradication, the country is planning to implement 2 nation-wide and 2 sub-national vaccination rounds from September to December 2017.  Nigeria - - No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 21 Aug 2016 in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno. - Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016). - Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance.  Lake Chad Basin  - The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno, Nigeria in 2016) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) (Borno and Sokoto provinces in Nigeria in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak. - Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.  Central Africa  - No new cases of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). The total number of cVDPV2 cases this year 2017 remains 7, in 2 separate outbreaks: in Haut Lomami province (5 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on 13 Jun 2017); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on 26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017, with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May 2017). - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time. Outbreak response is taking place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols, targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 across the 2 provinces. - The 1st mOPV2 round was implemented on 27-29 Jun 2017 in the 2 affected provinces; and the 2nd mOPV2 round ran from 13-15 Jul 2017 in Haut Lomami and 20-22 Jul 2017 in Maniema. - Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.  Middle East  - In Syria, 3 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were officially reported in the past week. The total number of cases in this outbreak is 33. Onset of paralysis of these cases is between 3 Mar 2017 and 10 Jul 2017. 31 of the cases are from Deir ez-Zor governorate (29 from Mayadeen district, one from Deir ez-Zor district, and one from Boukamal district); 1 case is from Talabyad district, Raqqa governorate; and, 1 is from Tadmour district in Homs governorate. - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized and implemented, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Two vaccination campaigns are planned for both Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa governorates. If there is geographic spread, the extent of these campaigns will have to be adjusted. - The 1st mOPV2 round in Deir ez-Zor was successfully carried out between 22-26 Jul 2017. Independent post-campaign monitoring reflected coverage of 88.4 percent (based on caregiver recall). The 2nd round is planned for 19-23 Aug 2017, and will include mOPV2 and IPV. - Raqqa Governorate started mOPV2 campaigns on 12 Aug 2017. - Plans are being finalized to mitigate the risks of further spread from the outbreak zone to neighbouring areas and countries, including immunization of at-risk populations in northwest Syria, Turkey and Lebanon. Following confirmation of the case in Homs, discussions are ongoing to further extend the geographic reach of the outbreak response.

(promed@promedmail.org)  This week's global update is similar to prior weeks in terms of low level identification of WPV1 associated disease (a single case confirmed in Afghanistan this past week), one positive WPV1 isolated from an environmental sample in Pakistan, and 3 newly confirmed cVDPV2 associated cases in Syria.  That being said, there have only been 9 confirmed cases of WPV1 associated paralytic disease worldwide this year (2017), compared with 37 cases reported last year (2016). In contrast there have been 40 confirmed cases of cVDPV2 confirmed this year (2017) compared with 5 last year (2016). As a reminder, outbreaks due to cVDPV's are considered as significant in the big picture of polio eradication, as they are due to vaccine polioviruses that have reverted in neurovirulence following passage through multiple individuals while circulating in the susceptible population. The goal of the polio eradication initiative is to interrupt transmission of both the WPV's and the cVDPVs. The presence of cVDPVs occurs when there are areas with low vaccination coverage where the vaccine virus (from the OPV) can continue circulating through the susceptible population.

Sennar State\nA medical source told Radio Dabanga that most of the cases in Sennar\ncame from Um Benin village southeast of the city except for 2 cases\nfrom El Dindir and El Souki. From Saturday to Monday 12-14 Aug 2017,\n26 cases of cholera arrived from Um Benin village. This led the local\nhealth authorities to open a new cholera isolation centre at the\nvillage. El Gedaref State\nEl Gedaref Hospital in East Sudan recorded 15 cases of cholera on\nTuesday and Wednesday 15-16 Aug 2017. A medical source told Radio\nDabanga that the hospital received 9 cases on Tue 15 Aug 2017, while\n6 cases were recorded on Wed 16Aug 2017. The medic said that all\ncases of cholera came from Uktuber, El Tadamon, El Geneina, and\nKadugli districts in El Gedaref. Kassala State\nA woman has died before she could be transferred to hospital, and 9\nothers were infected with cholera at El Matateib in North Delta\nlocality in Sudan's Kassala state. Youth activist Mohamed Seyidna told\nRadio Dabanga that \"the woman died in the village before she could be\ntransferred to the hospital\". He said that the hospitalised cases at\nWagar Hospital have risen to 9. He attributed the spread of cholera in the area to water pollution and\ncalled on the health authorities to make efforts to sterilize drinking\nwater and raise awareness of the residents. National epidemic\nThe National Epidemiological Corporation reported in early July 2017\nthat nearly 24 000 Sudanese have been infected and 940 cholera\npatients have died since the outbreak of the infectious disease in\nBlue Nile state in August 2016. The Sudanese authorities however,\nrefuse to call the disease by its name, and instead refer to it as\n\"Acute Watery Diarrhea\". The National Intelligence and Security\nService has repeatedly warned medics and the press in the country not\nto make mention of cholera. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{4}</strong> Cholera - Pakistan (Punjab Province).\nDate: Wed 16 Aug 2017.\nSource: The News (edited)\n(https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/223756-Number-of-cholera-cases-continues-to-swell) \nThe number of cases of cholera, a highly contagious and fatal disease\nis continuously on the rise and there is a threat that spread of the\ninfection may take shape of an epidemic if proper preventive and\ncontrol measures are not taken well in time. The 1st 2 cases of\ncholera were tested positive by National Institute of Health Islamabad\non Mon 31 Jul 2017 and another 2 confirmed positive for the\ninfection on Fri 4 Aug 2017. All the 4 patients were undergoing\ntreatment at Benazir Bhutto Hospital BH where as many as 4 more\nsuspects of the infection have been admitted for treatment. Data collected by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017 reveals that the\nallied hospitals have sent stool samples of over 10 child patients to\nNIH for confirmation of cholera in last week week of Sun 6 Aug\n2017. On Sat 12 Aug 2017, as many as 20 child patients with severe\ndiarrhoea were admitted at the BBH of which 4 were suspected as\npatients of cholera and their stool samples were sent to NIH for\nconfirmation, said Associate Professor of Paediatrics at Rawalpindi\nMedical University Dr Tariq Saeed when contacted by 'The News' on Mon\n14 Aug 2017. He added the hospital has not received confirmation reports from the\nNIH because of holidays there from Saturday to Monday. However, we\nhave been keeping the suspects in isolation under strict monitoring,\nhe said. He added that repeated rainfalls in the region and water inundation\ninside and outside homes in a number of localities particularly in\nthickly populated areas of the city are causing contamination of water\nand foodstuff that increases chances of spread of a number of\ninfections among population while children are at greater risk of\ncontracting life-threatening infections including cholera. It is important that the transmission of cholera occurs primarily by\ndrinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the feces\n(waste product) of an infected person, including one with no apparent\nsymptoms. It is observed that heavy rainfall causes collection of heavily\ncontaminated water in streets and houses and the waste water flooding\nout of various nullahs watercourses including Nullah Leh in town\ncauses infections including cholera, typhoid, dysentery,\ngastroenteritis, hepatitis A and E, shigellosis and giardiasis. Professor Tariq said the consumption of contaminated water and\nfoodstuff causes cholera, an infection in the small intestine caused\nby bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. Its main symptoms are watery diarrhea\nand vomiting that can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte\nimbalance, and death in cases which are not treated in time, he said. Health experts say that to avoid cholera and other infections, one\nmust use boiled water for drinking and should use vegetables after\nwashing with clean water and it must be kept in mind that raw\nvegetables should not be eaten in the existing weather conditions\ninstead these should be used after cooking. To a query, Professor Tariq said the heavy rainfall and water\naccumulation may contaminate water at sources and there may be chances\nof contamination of water at tube wells so individuals must boil water\nbefore drinking to avoid cholera and other infections. He added the appearance of cholera is alarming and it is time for\npeople to take extra ordinary preventive measures to safeguard their\nchildren and themselves from the disease. In case water is accumulated inside home due to heavy rainfall and\nflooded out of sewage lines, it must be wiped out immediately and the\nspace should be washed with clean water as soon as possible to avoid\ninfections. Avoiding inundation of contaminated water inside homes is\na must to avoid cholera and other infections, said Professor Tariq. Byline: Muhammad Qasim \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-SoAs\n(promed-SoAs@promedmail.org) Aggressive interventions to stem outbreaks of cholera include\nproviding sources of clean water and a vaccination campaign. The\nfollowing is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In:\nChronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract.\nGreydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in\npress): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons,\nvaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside\nof Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as\n60-80 percent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection\nlengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are: - Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 percent (95 percent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam; - Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however,\nhave suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be\neffective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and\noutbreak situations (63, 64). \"References\n-\n57.

Date: Sun 20 Aug 2017. Source: The News (edited) (https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/224669-Patient-tested-positive-at-HFH)   A patient undergoing treatment at one of the 3 teaching hospitals in town, Holy Family Hospital, tested positive for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) on Sat 19 Aug 2017. The patient was taken to the Holy Family Hospital on Mon 14 Aug 2017 from Tehsil Hazro of District Attock, some 80 kilometres 49.70 mi from Rawalpindi.  The confirmation of the patient has strengthened doubts that the population in the region may face a possible spike of CCHF ahead of Eidul Azha Islamic festival when sacrificial animals are being brought to the town in bulk.  However, it is important that this is not the 1st confirmed case of CCHF this year 2017 at the HFH. Data reveal that this year, 2017, a total of 22 suspected cases of CCHF were admitted to HFH, 5 of whom tested positive for the disease while 17 were negative. Studies show that the CCHF is caused by Nairovirus of the Bunyaviridae family transmitted to humans by the bite of hyalomma tick found on the skin of animals including goat and sheep or by direct contact with the blood of an infected animal or human. The case fatality rate ranges from 2 to 50 per cent. CCHF was 1st described in Crimea in 1944 and identified in 1956 in Congo.  It is worth mentioning here that the disease was 1st reported in Pakistan in 1976 but the numbers of cases have risen dramatically since 2000, with 50 to 60 patients being reported annually. It is important that the CCHF is endemic in Pakistan.  The patient is undergoing treatment at the HFH in isolation. He is stable, said the head of the Department of Infectious Diseases at Rawalpindi Medical University, assistant professor Dr Muhammad Mujeeb Khan while talking to 'The News' on Sat 19 Aug 2017. To avoid CCHF, he suggested that proper preventive measures should be taken while handling animals. It is better to establish water ponds carrying DEET or potassium permanganate and animals should be passed through it to clear their skin, he said.  byline: Muhammad Qasim   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)   <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> CCHF advisory notice. Date: Fri 18 Aug 2017. Source: Pakistan Today (edited) (https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2017/08/18/nih-issues-advisory-on-congo-fever-for-eid-ul-azha/)   The National Institute of Health (NIH) issued an advisory notice on Fri 18 Aug 2017 on prevention and control of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) for upcoming Eid-ul-Azha.  According to NIH, the objective of this advice was to sensitize human and animal health care authorities to further strengthen and improve the level of preparedness in prevention and control of CCHF.  The notice, which was issued by the NIH Field Epidemiology and Disease Surveillance Division, said that the CCHF is a widespread disease caused by a tickborne virus (Nairovirus) of the Bunyaviridae family with a case fatality rate of 10 to 40 per cent. It added that the ticks, especially of the _Hyalomma_ genus, are both a reservoir and a vector for the CCHF while numerous wild and domestic animals such as cattle, buffaloes, goats and sheep are silent carriers of this virus, and the adult ticks feed on these animals.  The notice said that although Balochistan remains the most affected province, cases have been reported from almost all parts of the country.  During 2016, out of 101 confirmed cases, 33 patients died. During 2017, till date, a total of 41 confirmed cases have been reported including 16 from Balochistan, 15 from Punjab, 7 from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and 3 from FATA.  The advisory notice said that the virus is transmitted to the people either through tick bites or through contact with the infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughtering them. Public health workers along with animal herders, veterinarians, para-veterinary staff, livestock workers, animal merchants, butchers and slaughterhouse workers are at risk of the disease. Apart from the above mentioned, people close to or taking care of a suspected patient, and individuals involved in burial practices are also at a risk of getting infected, it added. There is currently no vaccine available for humans and the only way to reduce infection is by raising awareness.  The notice further added that public health advice should focus on several aspects including wearing protective clothing  such as long sleeves and trousers. People should be advised to wear light coloured clothes during a visit to the animal market to allow easy detection of ticks, and to regularly examine clothing and skin for ticks and if found, removing them safely and using approved repellents on clothing and skin.  Similarly, citizens have been asked not to crush the ticks, wear gloves and other protective clothing while handling animals or their tissues, notably during slaughtering, butchering and culling procedures in slaughterhouses or at home. They have also been asked to avoid close physical contact with infected people, wearing gloves and protective equipment when taking care of them. People are also asked to wash hands frequently during caring or after visiting a patient.  The notice stated that insect repellents are the most effective in warding off ticks in human populations.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  The National Institute of Health Pakistan has issued this CCHF advisory notice in view of the upcoming Eid Ul Adha, when large numbers of livestock and cattle are moved from rural areas to urban markets for sale and subsequent slaughter.  More spatial repellent products are becoming commercially available. These products, containing active ingredients such as metofluthrin and allethrin, augment aerosol insecticide sprays, vaporizing mats, and mosquito coils, which have been available for some time. Such products can help to clear rooms or areas of mosquitoes (spray aerosols) or repel mosquitoes from a circumscribed area (coils, spatial repellents). Although many of these products appear to have repellent or insecticidal activity under particular conditions, they have not yet been adequately evaluated in peer-reviewed studies for their efficacy in preventing vectorborne disease. Travelers should supplement the use of these products with repellent on skin or clothing and using bed nets in areas where vectorborne diseases are a risk or biting arthropods are noted (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2018/the-pre-travel-consultation/protection-against-mosquitoes-ticks-other-arthropods).  CDC has evaluated information published in peer-reviewed scientific literature and data available from EPA to identify several types of EPA-registered products that provide repellent activity sufficient to help people reduce the bites of disease-carrying mosquitoes. Products containing the following active ingredients typically provide reasonably long-lasting protection:   - DEET (chemical name: N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide or N,N-diethyl-3-methyl-benzamide). Products containing DEET include, but are not limited to, Off!, Cutter, Sawyer, and Ultrathon.  - Picaridin (KBR 3023 Bayrepel and icaridin outside the US; chemical name: 2-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperidinecarboxylic acid 1-methylpropyl ester). Products containing picaridin include, but are not limited to, Cutter Advanced, Skin So Soft Bug Guard Plus, and Autan (outside the US).  - Oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE) or PMD (chemical name: para-menthane-3,8-diol), the synthesized version of OLE. Products containing OLE and PMD include, but are not limited to, Repel and Off ! Botanicals. This recommendation refers to EPA-registered products containing the active ingredient OLE (or PMD). \"Pure\" oil of lemon eucalyptus (essential oil not formulated as a repellent) is not recommended; it has not undergone similar, validated testing for safety and efficacy and is not registered with EPA as an insect repellent.  - IR3535 (chemical name: 3-N-butyl-N-acetyl-aminopropionic acid, ethyl ester). Products containing IR3535 include, but are not limited to, Skin So Soft Bug Guard Plus Expedition and SkinSmart.  - 2-undecanone (chemical name: methyl nonyl ketone). The product BioUD contains 2-undecanone.  Published data indicate that repellent efficacy and duration of protection vary considerably among products and among mosquito and tick species. Product efficacy and duration of protection are also markedly affected by ambient temperature, level of activity, amount of perspiration, exposure to water, abrasive removal, and other factors. In general, higher concentrations of active ingredient provide longer duration of protection, regardless of the active ingredient. Products with less than 10 per cent active ingredient may offer only limited protection, often 1-2 hours. Products that offer sustained-release or controlled-release (microencapsulated) formulations, even with lower active ingredient concentrations, may provide longer protection times. Studies suggest that concentrations of DEET above approximately 50 per cent do not offer a marked increase in protection time against mosquitoes; DEET efficacy tends to plateau at a concentration of about 50 per cent. CDC recommends using products with at least 20 per cent DEET on exposed skin to reduce biting by ticks that may spread disease. DEET-containing repellents prevent both mosquito and tick bites. Health Canada recommends using a product containing no more than 10 per cent DEET for children up to 12 years of age. However, products with a DEET concentration of 10 per cent or less should not be used for exposures lasting longer than 1 h to 2 h because they may not be effective in preventing tick bites. For children over 12 years of age and adults, a repellent containing up to 30 per cent DEET can be used as recommended on the product label. In the United States, 30 per cent DEET is approved for children aged 2 months of age and older. Reapplication of DEET is indicated only if the estimated protection period has passed and a significant risk of arthropod bites remains. Adverse events from DEET are rare. Contact dermatitis and eye irritation are the commonest side effects. Toxic encephalopathy has been reported, usually with prolonged or excessive use, or occasional DEET ingestion (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4173961/pdf/pch-19-326.pdf).  Permethrin, a synthetic pyrethroid , is highly effective both as an insecticide and as a repellent. It is not licensed to be used as a topical repellent but can be sprayed on clothing (mesh jackets, hats, shoes) bed nets and camping gear to repel and kill ticks, mosquitoes and other insects. - Mod.UBA  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/941).

This came about after 2\nkidney recipients in Taiwan were diagnosed with dengue 2 days after\nreceiving a kidney each from the same donor, said National Cheng Kung\nUniversity microbiology and immunology professor Dr Oscar Perng\nGuey-chuen. \"This indicates a potential risk,\" the Taiwan-based\nscientist said, adding that no dengue virus was detected in the\ndonor's blood. He said the donor contracted dengue in 2015 and in mid-2016, he died\nin an accident. His family donated his corneas, liver, heart, and\nkidneys. Both patients had the same strain of the dengue virus the\ndonor had in 2015 and one of the recipients died of dengue\nhaemorrhagic fever, he said. Asked where the virus could be hiding since it could not be detected\nin the blood, he said it was a question scientists are trying to\nanswer. Interestingly, those who received the donor's corneas, liver,\nand heart did not develop dengue, Dr Perng said on the sidelines of\nthe National Dengue And Arboviruses Infection Conference 2017\nyesterday 12 Aug 2017. He said although there was not enough\nevidence to show the virus came from the donor as the kidneys were not\ntested for dengue before the transplant, the same virus was found in\nthe patients' bodies after that. Dr Perng said his team had studied mice for dengue virus in the blood\ntestes, kidney, liver, spleen and brain, and found the virus present\nin the kidneys and brain. \"We believe the virus probably resided in\nthe kidneys and was not cleared by the body,\" he said, adding that the\nvirus could have been activated after transplant. He said this raised\nconcerns about asymptomatic people who are dengue carriers. Health Ministry deputy director, general Datuk Dr S Jeyaindran said\npatients with severe dengue would have better recovery if they were\ngiven colloids, a more concentrated fluid, at the early stage in fluid\nmanagement for dengue patients. Dr Jeyaindran, who was representing\nHealth Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam, said colloids may be\nintroduced at an earlier stage, instead of saline because it has not\nbeen successful in treating patients with severe dengue. He said more\nstudies will be conducted to find out at which stage the colloids\nshould be given. byline: Loh Foon Fong \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) - Air travel related spread of dengue.\nDate: Thu 3 Aug 2017.\nSource: Medical Xpress (edited)\n(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-08-air-responsible-dengue-asia.html) \nWhile the incidences of many other infectious diseases have declined\nover the past decade, the number of cases and outbreaks of dengue\nvirus have continued to increase. The spread of dengue to new areas is\nlikely due in large part to trends in air travel, researchers now\nreport in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Dengue virus affects as estimated 390 million people around the globe\neach year, and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild fever and\nheadache to severe low blood pressure. The virus has mostly caused\ndisease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, but a 2014\noutbreak in Japan broke that pattern. Overall, the geographic area\naffected by dengue has been growing in recent years. In the new work, Huaiyu Tian and Bing Xu, both of Beijing Normal\nUniversity, China, together with colleagues from the University of\nOxford and elsewhere analyzed the spread of dengue viruses in Asia\nfrom 1956 to 2015. They used 2202 genetic sequences of dengue viruses,\ncollected in 20 countries or regions of Asia over the 59 years, to\ndetermine how different strains were related. They also investigated\ntrends in air travel, maritime mobility, migration, and\nsocio-economics to determine what factors impact the spread of\ndengue. The spread of 3 different dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1, -2, and -3,\nis associated with air traffic more so than any other factors, the\ndata revealed. Air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India, the\nresearchers found, help seed dengue epidemics, while China, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, and Singapore help diffuse the virus to other Asian\ncountries. \"Future trends in global mobility could potentially accelerate the\nappearance and diffusion of DENV worldwide,\" the researchers say.\n\"Prevention and control of dengue epidemics requires a better\nunderstanding of its mode of geographic dissemination, especially for\ncountries in the tropics.\" Reference: Tian H, Sun Z, Faria NR, et al.

Onset of paralysis of these cases is between 3 Mar 2017 and 10 Jul 2017. The bulk of all cases are from Deir-Ez-Zour, the epicentre of this outbreak. - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized and implemented, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Two vaccination campaigns are planned for both Deir-Ez-Zour and Raqqa governorates. - The 1st mOPV2 round in Deir-Ez-Zour was successfully carried out between 22-26 Jul 2017. Independent post-campaign monitoring reflected coverage of 88.4 percent (based on caregiver recall). - The 2nd immunization round for Deir-Ez-Zor governorate started on 22 Aug 2017 and is ongoing. Monovalent OPV2 is being provided for children between 0-59 months of age, and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) for children 2-23 months. In addition to polio vaccines, Aqua Tabs are being provided to families for water purification - 2.5 tons of water purification tablets for 400 000 people have been disseminated at health centers. - Plans are being finalized to mitigate the risks of further spread from the outbreak zone to neighbouring areas and countries, including immunization of at-risk populations in northwest Syria, Turkey and Lebanon.

(promed@promedmail.org)  In the above global summary, there is still identified transmission ongoing in Pakistan as seen by the positive environmental sample in Karachi as well as the early report on a case of WPV1 associated disease in Karachi. It will be interesting to learn of the genetic profile of the environmental isolates in Karachi (from this past week as well as from a few weeks ago) and compare them with the newly identified WPV1 associated case in Karachi to see if they are genetically related.  There has been more activity associated with cVDPV2 in both Syria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), with 6 newly confirmed cases in Syria and 1 newly confirmed case in the DR Congo. According to the Situation Report in section <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> above, there are still 5 additional PV2 (poliovirus type 2) isolates in Syria undergoing final testing  4 from Deir al Zour and 1 from Raqqa. Hence there will probably be more cases confirmed in the coming days or weeks. I have not been able to identify similar report information from the DR Congo outbreak so it is not clear if the transmission has been interrupted leaving a total of 8 cases, or if there are still probable cases pending confirmation.

The Health Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu said the officers were in\nstable condition. Dr Mailu said investigations were underway to\nestablish whether the canteen had outsourced services to cater for the\nlarge number of officers. He said the ministry was concerned that\ninstead of eliminating cholera, new cases were emerging. Nairobi was first hit by the outbreak on 19 May 2017, with 56 cases\nhaving been reported. One of the police officers who requested anonymity said they ate ugali\n(a Kenyan staple made of maize flour) and meat stew at the canteen on\nSat 2 Sep 2017.

NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in\npress): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons,\nvaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside\nof Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as\n60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection\nlengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:\n- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam;\n- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses.

One case was notified in the Los Santos district, and the most recent\none a 7-year-old child from the Bebederos neighborhood of Tonosi, who\nremains hospitalized and under observation in the Las Tablas\nHospital. This brings to 7 the total cases of hantavirus fever and to 2 the\ncases of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome in the province. An inspection where the child resides was carried out.

Apparently, this recent case has hantavirus\nfever without hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). HPS is a serious\ndisease and can develop quickly, with a case fatality rate of around\n30 percent. This report does not give any details about the circumstances that led\nto the infection nor specify the hantavirus involved in this case. As\nnoted in comments on previous cases, Los Santos and adjoining\nprovinces are endemic for Choclo hantavirus. Although no data on this\nor the previous cases in earlier years include an indication of which\nhantavirus is responsible, Choclo is the only one of the 3\nhantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes HPS or\nhantavirus fever. No vaccine is available for Choclo virus.

Nat Commun. 2017; 8(1):\n169. doi: 10.1038/s41467-017-00246-8\n-\nAbstract\n\nZika virus is present in urine, saliva, tears, and breast milk, but\nthe transmission risk associated with these body fluids is currently\nunknown. Here we evaluate the risk of Zika virus transmission through\nmucosal contact in rhesus macaques. Application of high-dose Zika\nvirus directly to the tonsils of 3 rhesus macaques results in\ndetectable plasma viremia in all animals by 2 days post-exposure;\nvirus replication kinetics are similar to those observed in animals\ninfected subcutaneously. 3 additional macaques inoculated\nsubcutaneously with Zika virus served as saliva donors to assess the\ntransmission risk from contact with oral secretions from an infected\nindividual. 7 naive animals repeatedly exposed to donor saliva via the\nconjunctivae, tonsils, or nostrils did not become infected. Our\nresults suggest that there is a risk of Zika virus transmission via\nthe mucosal route, but that the risk posed by oral secretions from\nindividuals with a typical course of Zika virus infection is low. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall It is good to learn that Zika virus transmission via mucosa is\nunlikely. It will be interesting to know if virus shedding in saliva\nis a common occurrence in infected humans. - Mod.TY \n<br><br><strong>{4}</strong> CDC guidance for pregnancy.\nDate: Mon 24 Jul 2017.\nSource: CDC.

Update: Interim guidance\nfor health care providers caring for pregnant women with possible Zika\nvirus exposure  United States (including US Territories), July 2017.\nMMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2017; 66(29): 781-93. doi:\n10.15585/mmwr.mm6629e1\n-\nCDC has updated the interim guidance for US health care providers\ncaring for pregnant women with possible Zika virus exposure in\nresponse to 1) declining prevalence of Zika virus disease in the World\nHealth Organization's Region of the Americas (Americas) and 2)\nemerging evidence indicating prolonged detection of Zika virus\nimmunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies. Zika virus cases were 1st reported\nin the Americas during 2015-2016; however, the incidence of Zika virus\ndisease has since declined. As the prevalence of Zika virus disease\ndeclines, the likelihood of false-positive test results increases. In\naddition, emerging epidemiologic and laboratory data indicate that, as\nis the case with other flaviviruses, Zika virus IgM antibodies can\npersist beyond 12 weeks after infection. Therefore, IgM test results\ncannot always reliably distinguish between an infection that occurred\nduring the current pregnancy and one that occurred before the current\npregnancy, particularly for women with possible Zika virus exposure\nbefore the current pregnancy. These limitations should be considered\nwhen counseling pregnant women about the risks and benefits of testing\nfor Zika virus infection during pregnancy. This updated guidance\nemphasizes a shared decision-making model for testing and screening\npregnant women, one in which patients and providers work together to\nmake decisions about testing and care plans based on patient\npreferences and values, clinical judgment, and a balanced assessment\nof risks and expected outcomes. For these recommendations, the definition of possible Zika virus\nexposure has not changed and includes travel to, or residence in an\narea with risk for mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission or sex with\na partner who has traveled to or resides in an area with risk for\nmosquito-borne Zika virus transmission. These areas can be found on\nthe CDC \"Zika Travel Information\" webpage. Key recommendations include the following:\n1- All pregnant women in the United States and US territories should\nbe asked about possible Zika virus exposure before and during the\ncurrent pregnancy, at every prenatal care visit. CDC recommends that\npregnant women not travel to any area with risk for Zika virus\ntransmission. It is also recommended that pregnant women with a sex\npartner who has traveled to or lives in an area with risk for Zika\nvirus transmission use condoms or abstain from sex for the duration of\nthe pregnancy.\n2- Pregnant women with recent possible Zika virus exposure and\nsymptoms of Zika virus disease should be tested to diagnose the cause\nof their symptoms. The updated recommendations include concurrent Zika\nvirus nucleic acid test (NAT) and serologic testing as soon as\npossible through 12 weeks after symptom onset.\n3- Asymptomatic pregnant women with ongoing possible Zika virus\nexposure should be offered Zika virus NAT testing 3 times during\npregnancy. IgM testing is no longer routinely recommended because IgM\ncan persist for months after infection; therefore, IgM results cannot\nreliably determine whether an infection occurred during the current\npregnancy. The optimal timing and frequency of testing of asymptomatic\npregnant women with NAT alone is unknown. For pregnant women who have\nreceived a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection (by\neither NAT or serology positive/equivocal Zika virus or dengue virus\nIgM and Zika virus plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) 10 and\nhigher and dengue virus PRNT less than 10 results) any time before or\nduring the current pregnancy, additional Zika virus testing is not\nrecommended. For pregnant women without a prior laboratory-confirmed\ndiagnosis of Zika virus, NAT testing should be offered at the\ninitiation of prenatal care, and if Zika virus RNA is not detected on\nclinical specimens, 2 additional tests should be offered during the\ncourse of the pregnancy coinciding with prenatal visits.\n4- Asymptomatic pregnant women who have recent possible Zika virus\nexposure (that is, through travel or sexual exposure) but without\nongoing possible exposure are not routinely recommended to have Zika\nvirus testing. Testing should be considered using a shared\npatient-provider decision-making model, one in which patients and\nproviders work together to make decisions about testing and care plans\nbased on patient preferences and values, clinical judgment, a balanced\nassessment of risks and expected outcomes, and the jurisdiction's\nrecommendations. Based on the epidemiology of Zika virus transmission\nand other epidemiologic considerations (such as, seasonality),\njurisdictions might recommend testing of asymptomatic pregnant women,\neither for clinical care or as part of Zika virus surveillance. With\nthe decline in the prevalence of Zika virus disease, the updated\nrecommendations for the evaluation and testing of pregnant women with\nrecent possible Zika virus exposure but without ongoing possible\nexposure are now the same for all areas with any risk for Zika virus\ntransmission.\n5- Pregnant women who have recent possible Zika virus exposure and who\nhave a fetus with prenatal ultrasound findings consistent with\ncongenital Zika virus syndrome should receive Zika virus testing to\nassist in establishing the etiology of the birth defects. Testing\nshould include both NAT and IgM tests.\n6- The comprehensive approach to testing placental and fetal tissues\nhas been updated. Testing placental and fetal tissue specimens can be\nperformed for diagnostic purposes in certain scenarios (e.g., women\nwithout a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection and\nwho have a fetus or infant with possible Zika virus-associated birth\ndefects). However, testing of placental tissues for Zika virus\ninfection is not routinely recommended for asymptomatic pregnant women\nwho have recent possible Zika virus exposure but without ongoing\npossible exposure and who have a live born infant without evidence of\npossible Zika virus-associated birth defects.\n7- Zika virus IgM testing as part of preconception counseling to\nestablish baseline IgM results for non pregnant women with ongoing\npossible Zika virus exposure is not warranted because Zika virus IgM\ntesting is no longer routinely recommended for asymptomatic pregnant\nwomen with ongoing possible Zika virus exposure. also at the source URL above:\nAdditional interim guidance:\n- Laboratory testing of pregnant women with exposure to areas with\nrisk for Zika virus transmission\n- Prenatal management of pregnant women with laboratory evidence of\npossible Zika virus infection\n- Evaluation of placental and fetal tissue specimens for Zika virus\ninfection \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org)\nand\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be)(promed@promedmail.org) Readers interested in accessing the full report can find it at the\nsource URL above.

This cohort study evaluated adult patients with new-onset\nparainfectious or neuroinflammatory disease for the presence of acute\nZika virus infection in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples\nusing molecular and serological testing. An increase in the incidence\nof Guillain-Barré syndrome and encephalitis was observed compared\nwith the period before the outbreak of the Zika virus.\nMeaning The Zika virus may be associated with a rapid increase in the\nincidence of life-threatening neurologic syndromes; serologic and\nmolecular testing using blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples can\nserve as an alternative diagnostic strategy. Abstract\n\nImportance. There are no prospective cohort studies assessing the\nincidence and spectrum of neurologic manifestations secondary to Zika\nvirus (ZIKV) infection in adults.\nObjective. To evaluate the rates of acute ZIKV infection among\npatients hospitalized with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS),\nmeningoencephalitis, or transverse myelitis.\nDesign, setting, and participants. A prospective, observational cohort\nstudy was conducted at a tertiary referral center for neurological\ndiseases in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between 5 Dec 2015-10 May 2016,\namong consecutive hospitalized adults (older than 18 years of age)\nwith new-onset acute parainfectious or neuroinflammatory disease. All\nparticipants were tested for a series of arbovirosis. 3-month\nfunctional outcome was assessed.\nInterventions. Samples of serum and cerebrospinal fluid were tested\nfor ZIKV using real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain\nreaction and an IgM antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent\nassay. Clinical, radiographic (magnetic resonance imaging),\nelectrophysiological, and 3-month functional outcome data were\ncollected.\nMain outcomes and measures. The detection of neurologic complications\nsecondary to ZIKV infection.\nResults. 40 patients (15 women and 25 men; median age, 44 years\nrange, 22-72 years) were enrolled, including 29 patients (73\npercent) with GBS (90 percent Brighton level 1 certainty), 7 (18\npercent) with encephalitis, 3 (8 percent) with transverse myelitis,\nand 1 (3 percent) with newly diagnosed chronic inflammatory\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy. Of these, 35 patients (88 percent) had\nmolecular and/or serologic evidence of recent ZIKV infection in the\nserum and/or cerebrospinal fluid. Of the patients positive for ZIKV\ninfection, 27 had GBS (18 demyelinating, 8 axonal, and 1 Miller Fisher\nsyndrome), 5 had encephalitis (3 with concomitant acute neuromuscular\ndisease), 2 had transverse myelitis, and 1 had chronic inflammatory\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy. Admission to the intensive care unit was\nrequired for 9 patients positive for ZIKV infection (26 percent), and\n5 (14 percent) required mechanical ventilation. Compared with\nadmission during the period from 5 Dec 2013 - 10 May 2014 (before the\nBrazilian outbreak of ZIKV), admissions for GBS increased from a mean\nof 1.0 per month to 5.6 per month, admissions for encephalitis\nincreased from 0.4 per month to 1.4 per month, and admissions for\ntransverse myelitis remained constant at 0.6 per month. At 3 months, 2\npatients positive for ZIKV infection (6 percent) died (1 with GBS and\n1 with encephalitis), 18 (51 percent) had chronic pain, and the median\nmodified Rankin score among survivors was 2 (range, 0-5).\nConclusions and relevance. In this single-center Brazilian cohort,\nZIKV infection was associated with an increase in the incidence of a\ndiverse spectrum of serious neurologic syndromes. The data also\nsuggest that serologic and molecular testing using blood and\ncerebrospinal fluid samples can serve as a less expensive, alternative\ndiagnostic strategy in developing countries, where plaque reduction\nneutralization testing is impractical. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) This study illustrates the need to consider post-Zika virus infection\nas a cause of a variety of neurological diseases.

PLoS\nPathog. 2017; 13(8): e1006487. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006487\n-\nAbstract\n\nStudies have demonstrated cross-reactivity of anti-dengue virus (DENV)\nantibodies in human sera against Zika virus (ZIKV), promoting\nincreased ZIKV infection in vitro. However, the correlation between in\nvitro and in vivo findings is not well characterized. Thus, we\nevaluated the impact of heterotypic flavivirus immunity on ZIKV titers\nin biofluids of rhesus macaques. Animals previously infected (420 days\nor longer) with DENV2, DENV4, or yellow fever virus were compared to\nflavivirus-naïve animals following infection with a Brazilian ZIKV\nstrain. Sera from DENV-immune macaques demonstrated cross-reactivity\nwith ZIKV by antibody-binding and neutralization assays prior to ZIKV\ninfection, and promoted increased ZIKV infection in cell culture\nassays. Despite these findings, no significant differences between\nflavivirus-naïve and immune animals were observed in viral titers,\nneutralizing antibody levels, or immune cell kinetics following ZIKV\ninfection. These results indicate that prior infection with\nheterologous flaviviruses neither conferred protection nor increased\nobserved ZIKV titers in this non-human primate ZIKV infection model. Author summary\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne, emerging flavivirus. In\naddition to asymptomatic or mild febrile manifestations, ZIKV\ninfection in humans is associated with comparatively rare congenital\nand neurological abnormalities. Previous in vitro studies have\ndemonstrated cross-reactivity of antibodies derived from dengue virus\ninfections with ZIKV, as well as antibody-mediated enhancement of\ninfection in cell culture. Therefore, there is concern among\nvaccinologists and the public health community that the more severe\ndisease manifestations could result from prior immunity, either from\nnatural infection or vaccination, to antigenically-related\nflaviviruses (such as, dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis).\nIn this study, we evaluated the impact of prior immunity to dengue or\nyellow fever virus on ZIKV infection in a non-human primate model.\nAfter confirming that our immune cohorts were capable of\nrecapitulating the published in vitro observations of cross-reactivity\nand enhancement, we looked for alteration of viral titers in\nperipheral blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, and vaginal\nsecretions, as well as alterations in gross pathology, clinical\nparameters, and immune response, as compared to our flavivirus-naïve\ncohort. Importantly, no significant differences between\nflavivirus-naïve and primed animals were observed in viral titers or\nbiofluid distribution, neutralizing antibody levels, or immune cell\nkinetics following ZIKV infection. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org)\nand\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be)(promed@promedmail.org) Previous dengue infection, whether acquired naturally or antibody\nelicited by vaccines, has been a concern due to the possibility of\nantibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) with more severe disease. This\nconcern also relates to Zika virus antibody from vaccination for\nenhancement of dengue virus infections with resulting more severe\ndisease. The monkey studies reported above indicated that this may not\nbe a problem for Zika virus vaccinated individuals. Another effort to\navoid ADE is development of a vaccine that has epitopes specific for\nZika virus that are not shared by other flaviviruses.

ZIKV is also transmitted by\nsexual contact, although the relative importance of sexual\ntransmission is unclear. To better understand the role of sexual\ntransmission in ZIKV pathogenesis, a nonhuman primate (NHP) model of\nvaginal transmission was developed. ZIKV was readily transmitted to\nmature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by vaginal inoculation was\nreadily transmitted to mature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by\nvaginal individual RM with 1-5 vaginal inoculations required to\nestablish infection. After treatment with Depoprovera, a widely used\ncontraceptive progestin, 2 RM that initially resisted 8 vaginal ZIKV\ninoculations became infected after one ZIKV inoculation. Thus,\nDepoprovera seemed to enhance susceptibility to vaginal ZIKV\ntransmission. Unexpectedly, the kinetics of virus replication and\ndissemination after intravaginal ZIKV inoculation were markedly\ndifferent from RM infected with ZIKV by subcutaneous (SQ) virus\ninoculation. Several groups have reported that after SQ ZIKV\ninoculation vRNA is rapidly detected in blood plasma with vRNA less\ncommon in urine and saliva and only rarely detected in female\nreproductive tract (FRT) secretions. In contrast, in vaginally\ninoculated RM, plasma vRNA is delayed for several days and ZIKV\nreplication in, and vRNA shedding from, the FRT was found in all 6\nanimals. Further, after intravaginal transmission ZIKV RNA shedding\nfrom FRT secretions was detected before or simultaneously with plasma\nvRNA, and persisted for at least as long. Thus, ZIKV replication in\nthe FRT was independent of, and often preceded virus replication in\nthe tissues contributing to plasma vRNA. These results support the\nconclusion that ZIKV preferentially replicates in the FRT after\nvaginal transmission, but not after SQ transmission, and raise the\npossibility that there is enhanced fetal infection and pathology after\nvaginal ZIKV transmission compared to a mosquito transmitted ZIKV. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{10}</strong> _Aedes albopictus_ populations as vectors.\nDate: 2 Aug 2017.\nSource: American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (edited)\n(http://www.ajtmh.org/content/journals/10.4269/ajtmh.16-0969) \nref: Azar SR, Roundy CM, Rossi SL, et al.

Positive saliva samples were assayed for\ninfectious titer. Although all 3 mosquito populations were susceptible\nto all ZIKV strains, rates of infection, dissemination, and\ntransmission differed among mosquito and virus strains. _Aedes\nalbopictus_ from Salvador, Brazil, were the least efficient vectors,\ndemonstrating susceptibility to infection to 2 American strains of\nZIKV but failing to shed virus in saliva.

The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito\nbite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some\ncases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main\nvector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other\nmosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the\nvirus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit\nZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of\nlaboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_.\nInterestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the\nmidgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in\nRecife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially\nfed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced.\nCollectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range\nof ZIKV vectors than anticipated. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be) Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active\nvirus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their\nability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step\ntoward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_\nfed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in\nsaliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing.\nThe study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a\ncompetent vector.

One wonders\nif the specific _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ used or the Zika virus isolates\nwith which they were tested could account for these very different\nresults. Resolving these discrepancies is important because this\nmosquito species is very widely distributed around the world and bears\ndirectly on risk of outbreaks in geographic areas where _Aedes\naegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_ , Zika virus vectors, do not occur. -\nMod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"83":{"title":"Hantavirus - Americas (45): Panama (LS) ","date":["21","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH/EDR> Hantavirus - Americas (45): Panama (LS) [EXTERNAL]","summary":"\nHANTAVIRUS - AMERICAS (45): PANAMA (LOS SANTOS)\n*\nA ProMED-mail post\n(http://www.promedmail.org)\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n(http://www.isid.org).

The 3 new hantavirus fever cases are registered in\nTonosi, which is why health authorities are intensifying operations in\nthis region in Los Santos province. Carlos Muñoz, Regional Epidemiology Coordinator, stated that the\ncases include a 27-year-old woman and 2 males, each of 17 and 37\nyears. The woman was treated in the Tonosi Rural Hospital, whereas the other\n2 cases were managed in the Joaquín Pablo Franco Hospital in Las\nTablas, where the 37-year-old patient was released. These cases presumably in Los Santos province. - Mod.TY have\nincreased the total number of hantavirus fever cases to 12 and\nhantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome to 4. Of these hantavirus fever\nstatistics, 11 cases are from the Tonosi region. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) The number of cases of hantavirus infections in Los Santos province\ncontinues to climb this year (2017), with most coming from the Tonosi\nregion. There is no indication of which hantavirus is involved in these 3\ncases or in previous cases in Panama. As noted in comments in previous\nposts, Los Santos and adjoining provinces are endemic for Choclo\nhantavirus. Although no data on this or the previous cases in earlier\nyears include an indication of which hantavirus is responsible, Choclo\nis the only one of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama\nthat causes HPS (hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome) or hantavirus\nfever. No vaccine is available for Choclo virus.

Update: Interim guidance\nfor health care providers caring for pregnant women with possible Zika\nvirus exposure  United States (including US Territories), July 2017.\nMMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2017; 66(29): 781-93. doi:\n10.15585/mmwr.mm6629e1\n-\nCDC has updated the interim guidance for US health care providers\ncaring for pregnant women with possible Zika virus exposure in\nresponse to 1) declining prevalence of Zika virus disease in the World\nHealth Organization's Region of the Americas (Americas) and 2)\nemerging evidence indicating prolonged detection of Zika virus\nimmunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies. Zika virus cases were 1st reported\nin the Americas during 2015-2016; however, the incidence of Zika virus\ndisease has since declined. As the prevalence of Zika virus disease\ndeclines, the likelihood of false-positive test results increases. In\naddition, emerging epidemiologic and laboratory data indicate that, as\nis the case with other flaviviruses, Zika virus IgM antibodies can\npersist beyond 12 weeks after infection. Therefore, IgM test results\ncannot always reliably distinguish between an infection that occurred\nduring the current pregnancy and one that occurred before the current\npregnancy, particularly for women with possible Zika virus exposure\nbefore the current pregnancy. These limitations should be considered\nwhen counseling pregnant women about the risks and benefits of testing\nfor Zika virus infection during pregnancy. This updated guidance\nemphasizes a shared decision-making model for testing and screening\npregnant women, one in which patients and providers work together to\nmake decisions about testing and care plans based on patient\npreferences and values, clinical judgment, and a balanced assessment\nof risks and expected outcomes. For these recommendations, the definition of possible Zika virus\nexposure has not changed and includes travel to, or residence in an\narea with risk for mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission or sex with\na partner who has traveled to or resides in an area with risk for\nmosquito-borne Zika virus transmission. These areas can be found on\nthe CDC \"Zika Travel Information\" webpage. Key recommendations include the following:\n1- All pregnant women in the United States and US territories should\nbe asked about possible Zika virus exposure before and during the\ncurrent pregnancy, at every prenatal care visit. CDC recommends that\npregnant women not travel to any area with risk for Zika virus\ntransmission. It is also recommended that pregnant women with a sex\npartner who has traveled to or lives in an area with risk for Zika\nvirus transmission use condoms or abstain from sex for the duration of\nthe pregnancy.\n2- Pregnant women with recent possible Zika virus exposure and\nsymptoms of Zika virus disease should be tested to diagnose the cause\nof their symptoms. The updated recommendations include concurrent Zika\nvirus nucleic acid test (NAT) and serologic testing as soon as\npossible through 12 weeks after symptom onset.\n3- Asymptomatic pregnant women with ongoing possible Zika virus\nexposure should be offered Zika virus NAT testing 3 times during\npregnancy. IgM testing is no longer routinely recommended because IgM\ncan persist for months after infection; therefore, IgM results cannot\nreliably determine whether an infection occurred during the current\npregnancy. The optimal timing and frequency of testing of asymptomatic\npregnant women with NAT alone is unknown. For pregnant women who have\nreceived a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection (by\neither NAT or serology positive/equivocal Zika virus or dengue virus\nIgM and Zika virus plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) 10 and\nhigher and dengue virus PRNT less than 10 results) any time before or\nduring the current pregnancy, additional Zika virus testing is not\nrecommended. For pregnant women without a prior laboratory-confirmed\ndiagnosis of Zika virus, NAT testing should be offered at the\ninitiation of prenatal care, and if Zika virus RNA is not detected on\nclinical specimens, 2 additional tests should be offered during the\ncourse of the pregnancy coinciding with prenatal visits.\n4- Asymptomatic pregnant women who have recent possible Zika virus\nexposure (that is, through travel or sexual exposure) but without\nongoing possible exposure are not routinely recommended to have Zika\nvirus testing. Testing should be considered using a shared\npatient-provider decision-making model, one in which patients and\nproviders work together to make decisions about testing and care plans\nbased on patient preferences and values, clinical judgment, a balanced\nassessment of risks and expected outcomes, and the jurisdiction's\nrecommendations. Based on the epidemiology of Zika virus transmission\nand other epidemiologic considerations (such as, seasonality),\njurisdictions might recommend testing of asymptomatic pregnant women,\neither for clinical care or as part of Zika virus surveillance. With\nthe decline in the prevalence of Zika virus disease, the updated\nrecommendations for the evaluation and testing of pregnant women with\nrecent possible Zika virus exposure but without ongoing possible\nexposure are now the same for all areas with any risk for Zika virus\ntransmission.\n5- Pregnant women who have recent possible Zika virus exposure and who\nhave a fetus with prenatal ultrasound findings consistent with\ncongenital Zika virus syndrome should receive Zika virus testing to\nassist in establishing the etiology of the birth defects. Testing\nshould include both NAT and IgM tests.\n6- The comprehensive approach to testing placental and fetal tissues\nhas been updated. Testing placental and fetal tissue specimens can be\nperformed for diagnostic purposes in certain scenarios (e.g., women\nwithout a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection and\nwho have a fetus or infant with possible Zika virus-associated birth\ndefects). However, testing of placental tissues for Zika virus\ninfection is not routinely recommended for asymptomatic pregnant women\nwho have recent possible Zika virus exposure but without ongoing\npossible exposure and who have a live born infant without evidence of\npossible Zika virus-associated birth defects.\n7- Zika virus IgM testing as part of preconception counseling to\nestablish baseline IgM results for non pregnant women with ongoing\npossible Zika virus exposure is not warranted because Zika virus IgM\ntesting is no longer routinely recommended for asymptomatic pregnant\nwomen with ongoing possible Zika virus exposure. also at the source URL above:\nAdditional interim guidance:\n- Laboratory testing of pregnant women with exposure to areas with\nrisk for Zika virus transmission\n- Prenatal management of pregnant women with laboratory evidence of\npossible Zika virus infection\n- Evaluation of placental and fetal tissue specimens for Zika virus\ninfection \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org)\nand\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be)(promed@promedmail.org) Readers interested in accessing the full report can find it at the\nsource URL above.

Abstract\n\nImportance. There are no prospective cohort studies assessing the\nincidence and spectrum of neurologic manifestations secondary to Zika\nvirus (ZIKV) infection in adults.\nObjective. To evaluate the rates of acute ZIKV infection among\npatients hospitalized with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS),\nmeningoencephalitis, or transverse myelitis.\nDesign, setting, and participants. A prospective, observational cohort\nstudy was conducted at a tertiary referral center for neurological\ndiseases in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between 5 Dec 2015-10 May 2016,\namong consecutive hospitalized adults (older than 18 years of age)\nwith new-onset acute parainfectious or neuroinflammatory disease. All\nparticipants were tested for a series of arbovirosis. 3-month\nfunctional outcome was assessed.\nInterventions. Samples of serum and cerebrospinal fluid were tested\nfor ZIKV using real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain\nreaction and an IgM antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent\nassay. Clinical, radiographic (magnetic resonance imaging),\nelectrophysiological, and 3-month functional outcome data were\ncollected.\nMain outcomes and measures. The detection of neurologic complications\nsecondary to ZIKV infection.\nResults. 40 patients (15 women and 25 men; median age, 44 years\nrange, 22-72 years) were enrolled, including 29 patients (73\npercent) with GBS (90 percent Brighton level 1 certainty), 7 (18\npercent) with encephalitis, 3 (8 percent) with transverse myelitis,\nand 1 (3 percent) with newly diagnosed chronic inflammatory\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy. Of these, 35 patients (88 percent) had\nmolecular and/or serologic evidence of recent ZIKV infection in the\nserum and/or cerebrospinal fluid. Of the patients positive for ZIKV\ninfection, 27 had GBS (18 demyelinating, 8 axonal, and 1 Miller Fisher\nsyndrome), 5 had encephalitis (3 with concomitant acute neuromuscular\ndisease), 2 had transverse myelitis, and 1 had chronic inflammatory\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy. Admission to the intensive care unit was\nrequired for 9 patients positive for ZIKV infection (26 percent), and\n5 (14 percent) required mechanical ventilation. Compared with\nadmission during the period from 5 Dec 2013 - 10 May 2014 (before the\nBrazilian outbreak of ZIKV), admissions for GBS increased from a mean\nof 1.0 per month to 5.6 per month, admissions for encephalitis\nincreased from 0.4 per month to 1.4 per month, and admissions for\ntransverse myelitis remained constant at 0.6 per month. At 3 months, 2\npatients positive for ZIKV infection (6 percent) died (1 with GBS and\n1 with encephalitis), 18 (51 percent) had chronic pain, and the median\nmodified Rankin score among survivors was 2 (range, 0-5).\nConclusions and relevance. In this single-center Brazilian cohort,\nZIKV infection was associated with an increase in the incidence of a\ndiverse spectrum of serious neurologic syndromes. The data also\nsuggest that serologic and molecular testing using blood and\ncerebrospinal fluid samples can serve as a less expensive, alternative\ndiagnostic strategy in developing countries, where plaque reduction\nneutralization testing is impractical. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) This study illustrates the need to consider post-Zika virus infection\nas a cause of a variety of neurological diseases.

We found that ZIKV\npersistently infects brain endothelial cells that normally protect\nneurons from viral exposure. hBMECs are not damaged by ZIKV infection\nand, analogous to persistent HCV infection, ZIKV constitutively\ninduces and evades antiviral ISG IFN-stimulated genes and IFN\ninterferon responses to continuously replicate in hBMECs. As a\nresult, hBMECs provide a protective niche for systemic ZIKV spread and\na viral reservoir localized in the normally protective blood-brain\nbarrier. Consistent with the spread of ZIKV into neuronal\ncompartments, ZIKV was released basolaterally from hBMECs. Our\nfindings define hBMEC responses that contribute to persistent ZIKV\ninfection and potential targets for clearing ZIKV infections from\nhBMECs.

PLoS\nPathog. 2017; 13(8): e1006487. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006487\n-\nAbstract\n\nStudies have demonstrated cross-reactivity of anti-dengue virus (DENV)\nantibodies in human sera against Zika virus (ZIKV), promoting\nincreased ZIKV infection in vitro. However, the correlation between in\nvitro and in vivo findings is not well characterized. Thus, we\nevaluated the impact of heterotypic flavivirus immunity on ZIKV titers\nin biofluids of rhesus macaques. Animals previously infected (420 days\nor longer) with DENV2, DENV4, or yellow fever virus were compared to\nflavivirus-naïve animals following infection with a Brazilian ZIKV\nstrain. Sera from DENV-immune macaques demonstrated cross-reactivity\nwith ZIKV by antibody-binding and neutralization assays prior to ZIKV\ninfection, and promoted increased ZIKV infection in cell culture\nassays. Despite these findings, no significant differences between\nflavivirus-naïve and immune animals were observed in viral titers,\nneutralizing antibody levels, or immune cell kinetics following ZIKV\ninfection. These results indicate that prior infection with\nheterologous flaviviruses neither conferred protection nor increased\nobserved ZIKV titers in this non-human primate ZIKV infection model. Author summary\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne, emerging flavivirus. In\naddition to asymptomatic or mild febrile manifestations, ZIKV\ninfection in humans is associated with comparatively rare congenital\nand neurological abnormalities. Previous in vitro studies have\ndemonstrated cross-reactivity of antibodies derived from dengue virus\ninfections with ZIKV, as well as antibody-mediated enhancement of\ninfection in cell culture. Therefore, there is concern among\nvaccinologists and the public health community that the more severe\ndisease manifestations could result from prior immunity, either from\nnatural infection or vaccination, to antigenically-related\nflaviviruses (such as, dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis).\nIn this study, we evaluated the impact of prior immunity to dengue or\nyellow fever virus on ZIKV infection in a non-human primate model.\nAfter confirming that our immune cohorts were capable of\nrecapitulating the published in vitro observations of cross-reactivity\nand enhancement, we looked for alteration of viral titers in\nperipheral blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, and vaginal\nsecretions, as well as alterations in gross pathology, clinical\nparameters, and immune response, as compared to our flavivirus-naïve\ncohort. Importantly, no significant differences between\nflavivirus-naïve and primed animals were observed in viral titers or\nbiofluid distribution, neutralizing antibody levels, or immune cell\nkinetics following ZIKV infection. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org)\nand\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be)(promed@promedmail.org) Previous dengue infection, whether acquired naturally or antibody\nelicited by vaccines, has been a concern due to the possibility of\nantibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) with more severe disease. This\nconcern also relates to Zika virus antibody from vaccination for\nenhancement of dengue virus infections with resulting more severe\ndisease. The monkey studies reported above indicated that this may not\nbe a problem for Zika virus vaccinated individuals. Another effort to\navoid ADE is development of a vaccine that has epitopes specific for\nZika virus that are not shared by other flaviviruses.

We show that Z2 interacts with ZIKV surface\nprotein and disrupts the integrity of the viral membrane. Z2 can\npenetrate the placental barrier to enter fetal tissues and is safe for\nuse in pregnant mice. Intraperitoneal administration of Z2 inhibits\nvertical transmission of ZIKV in pregnant C57BL/6 mice and protects\ntype I or type I/II interferon receptor-deficient mice against lethal\nZIKV challenge. Thus, Z2 has potential to be further developed as an\nantiviral treatment against ZIKV infection in high-risk populations,\nparticularly pregnant women. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall It will be interesting to see if the same protective effect occurs\nwhen tested with Zika virus infections of non-human primates. -\nMod.TY \n<br><br><strong>{9}</strong> Female reproductive tract infection.\nDate: Wed 26 Jul 2017.\nSource: PLoS (Public Library of Science) Pathogens (edited)\n(http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006537) \nCarroll T, Lo M, Lanteri M, et al.

PLoS Pathog. 2017; 13(7): e1006537. doi:\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1006537\n-\nAbstract\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted virus that can cause\nsevere defects in an infected fetus. ZIKV is also transmitted by\nsexual contact, although the relative importance of sexual\ntransmission is unclear. To better understand the role of sexual\ntransmission in ZIKV pathogenesis, a nonhuman primate (NHP) model of\nvaginal transmission was developed. ZIKV was readily transmitted to\nmature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by vaginal inoculation was\nreadily transmitted to mature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by\nvaginal individual RM with 1-5 vaginal inoculations required to\nestablish infection. After treatment with Depoprovera, a widely used\ncontraceptive progestin, 2 RM that initially resisted 8 vaginal ZIKV\ninoculations became infected after one ZIKV inoculation. Thus,\nDepoprovera seemed to enhance susceptibility to vaginal ZIKV\ntransmission. Unexpectedly, the kinetics of virus replication and\ndissemination after intravaginal ZIKV inoculation were markedly\ndifferent from RM infected with ZIKV by subcutaneous (SQ) virus\ninoculation. Several groups have reported that after SQ ZIKV\ninoculation vRNA is rapidly detected in blood plasma with vRNA less\ncommon in urine and saliva and only rarely detected in female\nreproductive tract (FRT) secretions. In contrast, in vaginally\ninoculated RM, plasma vRNA is delayed for several days and ZIKV\nreplication in, and vRNA shedding from, the FRT was found in all 6\nanimals. Further, after intravaginal transmission ZIKV RNA shedding\nfrom FRT secretions was detected before or simultaneously with plasma\nvRNA, and persisted for at least as long. Thus, ZIKV replication in\nthe FRT was independent of, and often preceded virus replication in\nthe tissues contributing to plasma vRNA. These results support the\nconclusion that ZIKV preferentially replicates in the FRT after\nvaginal transmission, but not after SQ transmission, and raise the\npossibility that there is enhanced fetal infection and pathology after\nvaginal ZIKV transmission compared to a mosquito transmitted ZIKV. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{10}</strong> _Aedes albopictus_ populations as vectors.\nDate: 2 Aug 2017.\nSource: American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (edited)\n(http://www.ajtmh.org/content/journals/10.4269/ajtmh.16-0969) \nref: Azar SR, Roundy CM, Rossi SL, et al.

Positive saliva samples were assayed for\ninfectious titer. Although all 3 mosquito populations were susceptible\nto all ZIKV strains, rates of infection, dissemination, and\ntransmission differed among mosquito and virus strains. _Aedes\nalbopictus_ from Salvador, Brazil, were the least efficient vectors,\ndemonstrating susceptibility to infection to 2 American strains of\nZIKV but failing to shed virus in saliva. Mosquitoes from the Rio\nGrande Valley were the most efficient vectors and were capable of\nshedding all 3 tested ZIKV strains into saliva after 14 days of\nextrinsic incubation. In particular, ZIKV strain DakAR 41525 (Senegal\n1954) was significantly more efficient at dissemination and saliva\ndeposition than the others tested in Rio Grande mosquitoes. Overall,\nour data indicate that, while _Ae. albopictus_ is capable of\ntransmitting ZIKV, its competence is potentially dependent on\ngeographic origin of both the mosquito population and the viral\nstrain. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) This study illustrates that fact that not all Zika virus strains and\n_Ae. albopictus_ populations are created equal in terms of efficiency\nof transmission of this virus.

Zika virus replication in\nthe mosquito _Culex quinquefasciatus_ in Brazil. Emerg Microbes\nInfect. 2017; 6(8): e69. doi: 10.1038/emi.2017.59\n-\nAbstract\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has recently been associated\nwith an increased incidence of neonatal microcephaly and other\nneurological disorders. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito\nbite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some\ncases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main\nvector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other\nmosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the\nvirus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit\nZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of\nlaboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_.\nInterestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the\nmidgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in\nRecife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially\nfed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced.\nCollectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range\nof ZIKV vectors than anticipated. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be) Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active\nvirus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their\nability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step\ntoward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_\nfed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in\nsaliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing.\nThe study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a\ncompetent vector. Several other studies have shown this species to be\ninefficient vectors or refractory to Zika virus infection. One wonders\nif the specific _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ used or the Zika virus isolates\nwith which they were tested could account for these very different\nresults. Resolving these discrepancies is important because this\nmosquito species is very widely distributed around the world and bears\ndirectly on risk of outbreaks in geographic areas where _Aedes\naegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_ , Zika virus vectors, do not occur. -\nMod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"72":{"title":"Chikungunya (27) - Americas, Europe, Asia ","date":["18","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Chikungunya (27) - Americas, Europe, Asia [EXTERNAL]","summary":"\nCHIKUNGUNYA (27) - AMERICAS, EUROPE, ASIA\n*\nA ProMED-mail post\n(http://www.promedmail.org)\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n(http://www.isid.org) In this update:\nCases in various countries:\nRegional summaries\n\nAmericas\n\nRegional summary\nWHO/PAHO report Mexico and Central America\n\nMexico (Jalisco state)\nCosta Rica South America\n\nArgentina (Salto province)\nBrazil:\n- Roraima state\n- Ceara state\nPeru (Piura region) Europe\n\nFrance (Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region in Provence) Asia\n\nTaiwan (Tainan)\nIndia:\n- Delhi\n- Ludhiana, Punjab\n- Chandigarh, Haryana and Punjab states\n- Tamil Nadu state\n- Baramati tehsil, Pune, Maharastra state\n- Pune Maharashtra state ex Assam state\n- Kerala state\nBangladesh (Dhaka)\nNepal (Bhaktapur, province 3) \nCases in various countries:\nRegional summaries\n\nAmericas\n\nWHO/PAHO report\n18 Aug 2017\n(http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_topics&view=rdmore&cid=8975&Itemid=40931&lang=en) \nReported cases of chikungunya fever in the Americas, by country or\nterritory - 2017 to EW 33 week ending 18 Aug 2017.

Source: Sun Star (edited) (http://www.sunstar.com.ph/pampanga/local-news/2017/08/18/22-cases-japanese-encephalitis-recorded-pampanga-559150)   The Department of Health (DOH) has recorded a total of 149 cases of the deadly Japanese encephalitis with at least 22 cases in noted Pampanga , the highest in the Central Luzon region during the 1st quarter of 2017.  Japanese encephalitis is a viral disease spread by blood-sucking insects, particularly mosquitoes. The mosquitoes of the _Culex_ species are known to be the viral carriers.  The DOH said it affects the nervous system, causes severe complications and even death. The disease can infect not only humans but domestic animals, birds, bats, snakes, and frogs as well.  Among the symptoms of Japanese encephalitis, according to the DOH, are flu-like illnesses, fever, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, and tiredness. The symptoms usually appear 6-8 days after the mosquito bite.  If untreated, patients could suffer brain damage or paralysis as it also affects the spinal cord. In 30 percent of the cases, death could occur. Young children are more vulnerable due to their weak immune system.  While there is no cure, the virus could be prevented through vaccination.  A separate report from the World Health Organization (WHO) said that Japanese encephalitis is an illness that is endemic in the Philippines and is fatal in almost 3 out of 10 serious cases.  The WHO report also said that nearly all survivors of this mosquito-borne disease experience permanent damage, including physical disabilities, cognitive and language problems, learning disabilities and behavioral problems.  Byline: Ian Ocampo Flora   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  This is a cluster of Japanese encephalitis in central Luzon Island. Clusters have been relatively rare in the Philippines. There have been relatively few reports of human Japanese encephalitis (JE) cases in the Philippines in recent years, although the islands are within the JE virus endemic zone.  Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable encephalitis in Asia and the western Pacific. It is caused by a virus transmitted by culicine mosquitoes. Ardeid birds (including herons) are the reservoir species in nature.  Most human infections are asymptomatic or result in only mild symptoms. However, a small percentage of infected persons develop encephalitis, with symptoms including sudden onset of headache, high fever, disorientation, coma, tremors, and convulsions. About 1 in 4 encephalitis cases is fatal. Apparently, none of the cases in the report above died. There is no specific treatment for JE. Patient management focuses on supportive care and management of complications. Steps to prevent JE virus infections include vaccination and use of personal protective measures to prevent mosquito bites.

This was\nconfirmed upon receipt of laboratory results from test samples that\nwere sent to Australia. Agriculture officials were quick to assure,\nhowever, that the strain is slow to spread and causes few deaths. \"The rate of transmission is very, very low,\" Arlene Vytiaco, who\nheads animal disease control in the Bureau of Animal Industry, said in\na press briefing on Thursday. She explained that countries like Japan\nand Myamnar have been affected by H5N6 but have reported no humans\ninfected by the avian influenza. \"The mortality rate is also low,\"\nVytiaco said. Since H5N6 started in 2014, only 20 deaths have been\nreported worldwide. The Department of Health has been conducting regular check-ups on\nfarmers and workers in areas hit by the bird flu outbreak. Vytiaco\nsaid no new patients have been admitted since 2 farm workers reported\nflu-like symptoms last week week of Sun 13 Aug 2017 but eventually\ntested negative for bird flu. The government had been waiting to see what the bird flu's specific N\nstrain was - particularly on the lookout for the N1 and N6 strains,\nwhich can be passed on to humans. Local tests had confirmed it was not\nthe far deadlier H5N1 virus. However, it had to send samples to\nAustralia to check whether it was H5N6, since the government did not\nhave its own test kits here. This was said by Dr Arlene Vytiaco, who\noversees disease control for the Bureau of Animal Industry. Reports of bird flu being present were 1st reported earlier this month\nAugust 2017. The virus was found in birds from 7 farms in San Luis,\nPampanga. The Department of Agriculture DA earlier said the virus\nhad been present since April 2017, but was only reported in August\n2017 after 37 000 birds had died. It added the strain of avian flu\npresent in these birds was not transmissible to humans. On Sun 13 Aug 2017, agriculture secretary Manny Piñol said another\nround of tests was under way to determine whether H5N6  the strain\nof the virus that can be passed on to humans  was present. The DA imposed a ban on the shipment of poultry and poultry products\nfrom Luzon to other parts of the country on Sun 13 Aug 2017 as a\nprecautionary measure, but it was lifted on Tue 22 Aug 2017. byline: Claire Jiao \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) The above report provides follow-up information on an earlier post\nAvian influenza, human (66): Philippines, H5\nhttp://promedmail.org/post/20170818.5254521, in which 2 human cases\nwere suspected to have avian influenza H5, but were confirmed as\nnegative.

This came about after 2\nkidney recipients in Taiwan were diagnosed with dengue 2 days after\nreceiving a kidney each from the same donor, said National Cheng Kung\nUniversity microbiology and immunology professor Dr Oscar Perng\nGuey-chuen. \"This indicates a potential risk,\" the Taiwan-based\nscientist said, adding that no dengue virus was detected in the\ndonor's blood. He said the donor contracted dengue in 2015 and in mid-2016, he died\nin an accident. His family donated his corneas, liver, heart, and\nkidneys. Both patients had the same strain of the dengue virus the\ndonor had in 2015 and one of the recipients died of dengue\nhaemorrhagic fever, he said. Asked where the virus could be hiding since it could not be detected\nin the blood, he said it was a question scientists are trying to\nanswer. Interestingly, those who received the donor's corneas, liver,\nand heart did not develop dengue, Dr Perng said on the sidelines of\nthe National Dengue And Arboviruses Infection Conference 2017\nyesterday 12 Aug 2017. He said although there was not enough\nevidence to show the virus came from the donor as the kidneys were not\ntested for dengue before the transplant, the same virus was found in\nthe patients' bodies after that. Dr Perng said his team had studied mice for dengue virus in the blood\ntestes, kidney, liver, spleen and brain, and found the virus present\nin the kidneys and brain. \"We believe the virus probably resided in\nthe kidneys and was not cleared by the body,\" he said, adding that the\nvirus could have been activated after transplant. He said this raised\nconcerns about asymptomatic people who are dengue carriers. Health Ministry deputy director, general Datuk Dr S Jeyaindran said\npatients with severe dengue would have better recovery if they were\ngiven colloids, a more concentrated fluid, at the early stage in fluid\nmanagement for dengue patients. Dr Jeyaindran, who was representing\nHealth Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam, said colloids may be\nintroduced at an earlier stage, instead of saline because it has not\nbeen successful in treating patients with severe dengue. He said more\nstudies will be conducted to find out at which stage the colloids\nshould be given. byline: Loh Foon Fong \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) - Air travel related spread of dengue.\nDate: Thu 3 Aug 2017.\nSource: Medical Xpress (edited)\n(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-08-air-responsible-dengue-asia.html) \nWhile the incidences of many other infectious diseases have declined\nover the past decade, the number of cases and outbreaks of dengue\nvirus have continued to increase. The spread of dengue to new areas is\nlikely due in large part to trends in air travel, researchers now\nreport in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Dengue virus affects as estimated 390 million people around the globe\neach year, and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild fever and\nheadache to severe low blood pressure. The virus has mostly caused\ndisease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, but a 2014\noutbreak in Japan broke that pattern. Overall, the geographic area\naffected by dengue has been growing in recent years. In the new work, Huaiyu Tian and Bing Xu, both of Beijing Normal\nUniversity, China, together with colleagues from the University of\nOxford and elsewhere analyzed the spread of dengue viruses in Asia\nfrom 1956 to 2015. They used 2202 genetic sequences of dengue viruses,\ncollected in 20 countries or regions of Asia over the 59 years, to\ndetermine how different strains were related. They also investigated\ntrends in air travel, maritime mobility, migration, and\nsocio-economics to determine what factors impact the spread of\ndengue. The spread of 3 different dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1, -2, and -3,\nis associated with air traffic more so than any other factors, the\ndata revealed. Air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India, the\nresearchers found, help seed dengue epidemics, while China, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, and Singapore help diffuse the virus to other Asian\ncountries. \"Future trends in global mobility could potentially accelerate the\nappearance and diffusion of DENV worldwide,\" the researchers say.\n\"Prevention and control of dengue epidemics requires a better\nunderstanding of its mode of geographic dissemination, especially for\ncountries in the tropics.\" Reference: Tian H, Sun Z, Faria NR, et al.

On Tue 29 Aug 2017, Dr Rene Bagamasbad, Laguna health officer, said the victims were a 9-year-old boy in Calauan town and a 6-year-old boy in San Pablo City. He said the children died around 2 weeks ago.  Calauan and San Pablo City, being adjacent to each other, were also placed under investigation by the health office.  Only the Calauan case has so far reached the Calabarzon office of the Department of Health, according to Dr Rio Magpantay, DOH regional director.  The regional office, however, had also started monitoring \"signs and symptoms\" of possible Japanese encephalitis incidence in other parts of Laguna.  Calabarzon stands for the provinces of Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, and Quezon.  The disease, which is transmitted by the _Culex_ mosquito, commonly causes abdominal pains, fever, and seizures. It may also cause a part of the brain to swell.  Vaccines are available. But there is no cure yet for the disease. Vaccines are currently not part of the government's immunization program.  Magpantay said there was no declaration of an outbreak. But the DOH regional office would strengthen the surveillance of communities and hospitals.  It usually takes some time to confirm a case of Japanese encephalitis because specimens, such as the patient's blood sample, would have to be collected and submitted for testing at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine in Muntinlupa in Metro Manila.

According to the latest disease surveillance report of the DOH, 910 leptospirosis cases were recorded from 1 Jan to 5 Aug 2017. \"This is 71.1 percent higher compared to what was recorded in the same period as last year 2016, which was 532,\" said the DOH report.  Leptospirosis is an infectious disease caused by the _Leptospira interrogans_ bacteria. The leptospira bacteria are transmitted through wounds when in contact with floodwaters, vegetation, and moist soil contaminated with the urine of infected animals, especially rats. Leptospirosis is characterized by fever, muscle pain, reddish-yellowish body discoloration, dark-colored urine, light stools, low urine output, and severe headache.  There was also a higher number of deaths; with 96 or a 10.55 percent case fatality rate. In the same period last year 2016, there were only 50 deaths or 9.40 percent case fatality rate.  The majority of the leptospirosis cases were recorded in the National Capital Region with 172 cases; Davao Region with 112 cases; Western Visayas with 98; Central Luzon with 80; and Eastern Visayas with 72. Regions with the highest increase in cases were Eastern Visayas with 620 percent increase; Davao Region with 558 percent increase; Central Visayas with 390 percent increase; Caraga with 240 percent increase; and Cagayan Valley with 103 percent increase.  \nByline: Charina Clarisse Echaluce   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Currently, the Philippines is divided into 17 regions (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_the_Philippines).

Source: The Pirbright Institute, UK, News (edited) (https://www.pirbright.ac.uk/news/2017/08/african-swine-fever-advance-through-europe)   The continued advance of African swine fever (ASF) through eastern European countries has triggered concern amongst pig farmers and governing bodies. DEFRA UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs has upgraded the threat to the UK from 'very low' to 'low'  meaning the risk is \"rare but could occur\" (EFSA European Food Safety Authority terminology). This severe disease of pigs entered Europe through Georgia in 2007, and has since continued to the Russian Federation and eastern Europe, including EU countries in the Baltic States, Poland and very recently the Czech Republic, in wild boar. In early August 2017, an outbreak was confirmed for the 1st time in Romania among backyard pigs.  African swine fever is caused by infection with ASF virus (ASFV), which can have fatality rates of up to 100 per cent. The virus causes acute disease in domestic pigs and wild boar, and may cause varying clinical signs that are similar to other pig diseases such as high fever, lethargy and loss of appetite. Pigs may also die suddenly without clinical signs.  Although the virus does not cause disease in humans, the impact it has on the economy, especially through trade and farming, is substantial. As a consequence of ASF in Poland and the Baltic States the value of pork and pig exports was reduced by USD 960 million (2014-2015). In Denmark, the predicted impact of an ASF outbreak is estimated at USD 12 million in direct losses and USD 349 million in exports.  Unless the appropriate control measures are put in place, additional outbreaks could occur across Europe, further into Russia and beyond to Asia. An outbreak in the UK is unlikely as imports of meat and pigs are extremely well regulated and the UK does not have a wild boar population substantial enough or widespread enough to maintain an outbreak. However, personal imports of pork products from affected areas could result in disease incursion if deliberately or accidently fed to pigs or wild boar, actions which are illegal.  The seriousness of an outbreak for some countries could be far worse than others; China is home to over half the world's pig population and an outbreak of ASF could result in devastating consequences. In a Veterinary Record article see reference below world-expert on ASF Dr Linda Dixon leader of the ASF group at The Pirbright Institute, outlines the factors that increase the likelihood of ASF spreading to China and highlights areas that could be improved to reduce the risk of an outbreak including biosecurity.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  Subscribers may refer to more data in the article above, addressing the following questions: - how does ASF spread? - how quickly does it spread? - how can the spread of ASFV be prevented? - what is The Pirbright Institute doing to help?  The last item includes the following statement: \"The vaccine research is crucial for the prevention and control of ASF, and good progress has so far been made. An effective vaccine will enable better control and prevention measures to be put in place in the future, helping stem the losses currently being suffered by farmers around the world.\"  The editorial \"Preparing for the worst: African swine fever in China\", by Linda K Dixon, was recently published in the Veterinary Record  Vet Rec. 2017; 181: 115-6, doi: 10.1136/vr.j3525.

The isolate from the product was almost identical by\nwhole genome sequencing to isolates from 3 of 4 patients, whose food\nhistory in 3 of the patients identified the smoked salmon as the\nlikely source. The smoked salmon product was recalled from about 600 stores in\nDenmark and a limited number in Metro Poland. Up to 3 of the 4 patients had become ill in the same week in August\n2017 and the 4th had become ill in May 2017. One of the 4 patients has\ndied. All 4 patients had severe underlying disease. DSG consists of chains (fotex, Bilka, Netto, and Salling) with more\nthan 1400 stores in Denmark, Germany, Poland and Sweden. Refrigerated smoked salmon is a recognized potential source for\nlisteriosis, similar to other cold cut meats and non-heat treated\ncured smoked meats, being a ready-to-eat product that does not require\nfurther cooking before eating. The news report said that more cases\nrelated to this outbreak were expected, despite the recall, as the\nincubation period for listeriosis is up to 3 weeks actually symptoms\ncan start up to as 70 days after exposure. - Mod.ML A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at:\n(http://healthmap.org/promed/p/113).

The total amount of dead wild boars discovered in the woods around\nZlín, in the far east of the Czech Republic, stood at 94 at the end\nof August 2017. In this month, 23 new infected carcasses were found,\nwhich is a downward trend from July 2017, when 68 reports were sent\nto the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). The 1st report of\nASF in Czech wild boars was on Wed 21 Jun 2017. Many neighbouring countries have alerted their local pig producers to\nbe very careful what to feed their pigs - and their inhabitants what\nto purchase and how to dispose of it. So did Slovakia, according to\nthe Slovak Spectator. Zlín is only a few km away from the western\nSlovak border, to its north is Poland where ASF has been around since\n2014 and on its eastern border is Ukraine, where ASF has been\nconfirmed since 2011. In a presentation, given in mid-July 2017 to the European\nCommission's Standing Committee On Animals, Plants, Food and Feed\n(SCoPAFF), Dr Petr Šatrán of the Czech State Veterinary\nAdministration indicated that human activities are most likely the\ncause of the spread of the virus, seeing that the nearest reported\ncases of ASF were roughly 500 km 310.68 mi away and that the\npositive dead wild boars were found in inhabited areas. In the other country where ASF was found for the 1st time in 2017,\nRomania, things appear relatively quiet. News broke early this month\nAugust 2017 that ASF was also found on 2 backyard farms in the north\nof the country. Ever since, the Romanian authorities did not report\nany further outbreaks of ASF to the OIE. Of all other countries in the European Union, especially Poland has\ncontinued to report outbreaks of African Swine Fever in smaller and\nmiddle-sized operations. In August alone, on 23 farm sites of various\nsizes, ASF was found to have infected at least one animal, after which\nthe entire herd would have to be culled. The biggest operation in this respect was a farm near Monki, Podlaskie\nprovince, where all remaining 431 pigs had to be culled after 11 had\ndied as a result of ASF, on Sat 19 Aug 2017. Noteworthy as well was\nthe ASF-related closure of 2 farms in Lack, Lubelskie province, in\nearly August. These farms had 136 and 141 pigs respectively see also\nitem 2.

EU disease control measures require designation of risk areas as Part\nI (wild boar at risk, but no cases found), Part II (wild boar testing\npositive but no spill over into domestic pigs), Part III (cases in\nwild boar and occasional spill over into domestic pigs) and Part IV\nwhich concerns the island of Sardinia only. Consignments of live pigs,\nlive wild boars, meat of either source and animal by-products of\neither source are only allowed under certain derogations. For a full\nexplanation, see European Commission Implementing Decision\n2014/708/EU. ASF, a viral disease against which no vaccine has become available so\nfar, is currently threatening central and western Europe, where dense\npopulations of wild boar are present. According to a recent update of DEFRA (UK) ASF situation assessment,\nthe continuing cases in the Czech Republic, the spread in Poland which\nappears to be due to several breakdowns in biosecurity and the new\noutbreaks in Romania are \"concerning\". This signifies a spread in\ngeographic distribution, a possible drop in biosecurity awareness and\ntherefore an increase in the weight of infection in East Europe. Despite the relatively low level of trade in live pigs, there could be\na substantial movement of people, vehicles and personal imports of\npork products, therefore the risk of ASF introduction to the UK has\nbeen raised from \"very low\" (that is, \"rare but could occur\") to\n\"low\". The Russian veterinary watchdog Rosselkhoznadzor believes ASF will\nkeep moving west via 2 main pathways. The southerly route, has already\nseen the virus spread from Ukraine to Moldova. Russian vets believe it\ncould penetrate central Romania, then move to the Balkans, including\nBulgaria and Serbia.

Nat Commun. 2017; 8(1):\n169. doi: 10.1038/s41467-017-00246-8\n-\nAbstract\n\nZika virus is present in urine, saliva, tears, and breast milk, but\nthe transmission risk associated with these body fluids is currently\nunknown. Here we evaluate the risk of Zika virus transmission through\nmucosal contact in rhesus macaques. Application of high-dose Zika\nvirus directly to the tonsils of 3 rhesus macaques results in\ndetectable plasma viremia in all animals by 2 days post-exposure;\nvirus replication kinetics are similar to those observed in animals\ninfected subcutaneously. 3 additional macaques inoculated\nsubcutaneously with Zika virus served as saliva donors to assess the\ntransmission risk from contact with oral secretions from an infected\nindividual. 7 naive animals repeatedly exposed to donor saliva via the\nconjunctivae, tonsils, or nostrils did not become infected. Our\nresults suggest that there is a risk of Zika virus transmission via\nthe mucosal route, but that the risk posed by oral secretions from\nindividuals with a typical course of Zika virus infection is low. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall It is good to learn that Zika virus transmission via mucosa is\nunlikely. It will be interesting to know if virus shedding in saliva\nis a common occurrence in infected humans. - Mod.TY \n<br><br><strong>{4}</strong> CDC guidance for pregnancy.\nDate: Mon 24 Jul 2017.\nSource: CDC.

Update: Interim guidance\nfor health care providers caring for pregnant women with possible Zika\nvirus exposure  United States (including US Territories), July 2017.\nMMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2017; 66(29): 781-93. doi:\n10.15585/mmwr.mm6629e1\n-\nCDC has updated the interim guidance for US health care providers\ncaring for pregnant women with possible Zika virus exposure in\nresponse to 1) declining prevalence of Zika virus disease in the World\nHealth Organization's Region of the Americas (Americas) and 2)\nemerging evidence indicating prolonged detection of Zika virus\nimmunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies. Zika virus cases were 1st reported\nin the Americas during 2015-2016; however, the incidence of Zika virus\ndisease has since declined. As the prevalence of Zika virus disease\ndeclines, the likelihood of false-positive test results increases. In\naddition, emerging epidemiologic and laboratory data indicate that, as\nis the case with other flaviviruses, Zika virus IgM antibodies can\npersist beyond 12 weeks after infection. Therefore, IgM test results\ncannot always reliably distinguish between an infection that occurred\nduring the current pregnancy and one that occurred before the current\npregnancy, particularly for women with possible Zika virus exposure\nbefore the current pregnancy. These limitations should be considered\nwhen counseling pregnant women about the risks and benefits of testing\nfor Zika virus infection during pregnancy. This updated guidance\nemphasizes a shared decision-making model for testing and screening\npregnant women, one in which patients and providers work together to\nmake decisions about testing and care plans based on patient\npreferences and values, clinical judgment, and a balanced assessment\nof risks and expected outcomes. For these recommendations, the definition of possible Zika virus\nexposure has not changed and includes travel to, or residence in an\narea with risk for mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission or sex with\na partner who has traveled to or resides in an area with risk for\nmosquito-borne Zika virus transmission. These areas can be found on\nthe CDC \"Zika Travel Information\" webpage. Key recommendations include the following:\n1- All pregnant women in the United States and US territories should\nbe asked about possible Zika virus exposure before and during the\ncurrent pregnancy, at every prenatal care visit. CDC recommends that\npregnant women not travel to any area with risk for Zika virus\ntransmission. It is also recommended that pregnant women with a sex\npartner who has traveled to or lives in an area with risk for Zika\nvirus transmission use condoms or abstain from sex for the duration of\nthe pregnancy.\n2- Pregnant women with recent possible Zika virus exposure and\nsymptoms of Zika virus disease should be tested to diagnose the cause\nof their symptoms. The updated recommendations include concurrent Zika\nvirus nucleic acid test (NAT) and serologic testing as soon as\npossible through 12 weeks after symptom onset.\n3- Asymptomatic pregnant women with ongoing possible Zika virus\nexposure should be offered Zika virus NAT testing 3 times during\npregnancy. IgM testing is no longer routinely recommended because IgM\ncan persist for months after infection; therefore, IgM results cannot\nreliably determine whether an infection occurred during the current\npregnancy. The optimal timing and frequency of testing of asymptomatic\npregnant women with NAT alone is unknown. For pregnant women who have\nreceived a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection (by\neither NAT or serology positive/equivocal Zika virus or dengue virus\nIgM and Zika virus plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) 10 and\nhigher and dengue virus PRNT less than 10 results) any time before or\nduring the current pregnancy, additional Zika virus testing is not\nrecommended. For pregnant women without a prior laboratory-confirmed\ndiagnosis of Zika virus, NAT testing should be offered at the\ninitiation of prenatal care, and if Zika virus RNA is not detected on\nclinical specimens, 2 additional tests should be offered during the\ncourse of the pregnancy coinciding with prenatal visits.\n4- Asymptomatic pregnant women who have recent possible Zika virus\nexposure (that is, through travel or sexual exposure) but without\nongoing possible exposure are not routinely recommended to have Zika\nvirus testing. Testing should be considered using a shared\npatient-provider decision-making model, one in which patients and\nproviders work together to make decisions about testing and care plans\nbased on patient preferences and values, clinical judgment, a balanced\nassessment of risks and expected outcomes, and the jurisdiction's\nrecommendations. Based on the epidemiology of Zika virus transmission\nand other epidemiologic considerations (such as, seasonality),\njurisdictions might recommend testing of asymptomatic pregnant women,\neither for clinical care or as part of Zika virus surveillance. With\nthe decline in the prevalence of Zika virus disease, the updated\nrecommendations for the evaluation and testing of pregnant women with\nrecent possible Zika virus exposure but without ongoing possible\nexposure are now the same for all areas with any risk for Zika virus\ntransmission.\n5- Pregnant women who have recent possible Zika virus exposure and who\nhave a fetus with prenatal ultrasound findings consistent with\ncongenital Zika virus syndrome should receive Zika virus testing to\nassist in establishing the etiology of the birth defects. Testing\nshould include both NAT and IgM tests.\n6- The comprehensive approach to testing placental and fetal tissues\nhas been updated. Testing placental and fetal tissue specimens can be\nperformed for diagnostic purposes in certain scenarios (e.g., women\nwithout a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection and\nwho have a fetus or infant with possible Zika virus-associated birth\ndefects). However, testing of placental tissues for Zika virus\ninfection is not routinely recommended for asymptomatic pregnant women\nwho have recent possible Zika virus exposure but without ongoing\npossible exposure and who have a live born infant without evidence of\npossible Zika virus-associated birth defects.\n7- Zika virus IgM testing as part of preconception counseling to\nestablish baseline IgM results for non pregnant women with ongoing\npossible Zika virus exposure is not warranted because Zika virus IgM\ntesting is no longer routinely recommended for asymptomatic pregnant\nwomen with ongoing possible Zika virus exposure. also at the source URL above:\nAdditional interim guidance:\n- Laboratory testing of pregnant women with exposure to areas with\nrisk for Zika virus transmission\n- Prenatal management of pregnant women with laboratory evidence of\npossible Zika virus infection\n- Evaluation of placental and fetal tissue specimens for Zika virus\ninfection \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org)\nand\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be)(promed@promedmail.org) Readers interested in accessing the full report can find it at the\nsource URL above.

This cohort study evaluated adult patients with new-onset\nparainfectious or neuroinflammatory disease for the presence of acute\nZika virus infection in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples\nusing molecular and serological testing. An increase in the incidence\nof Guillain-Barré syndrome and encephalitis was observed compared\nwith the period before the outbreak of the Zika virus.\nMeaning The Zika virus may be associated with a rapid increase in the\nincidence of life-threatening neurologic syndromes; serologic and\nmolecular testing using blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples can\nserve as an alternative diagnostic strategy. Abstract\n\nImportance. There are no prospective cohort studies assessing the\nincidence and spectrum of neurologic manifestations secondary to Zika\nvirus (ZIKV) infection in adults.\nObjective. To evaluate the rates of acute ZIKV infection among\npatients hospitalized with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS),\nmeningoencephalitis, or transverse myelitis.\nDesign, setting, and participants. A prospective, observational cohort\nstudy was conducted at a tertiary referral center for neurological\ndiseases in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between 5 Dec 2015-10 May 2016,\namong consecutive hospitalized adults (older than 18 years of age)\nwith new-onset acute parainfectious or neuroinflammatory disease. All\nparticipants were tested for a series of arbovirosis. 3-month\nfunctional outcome was assessed.\nInterventions. Samples of serum and cerebrospinal fluid were tested\nfor ZIKV using real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain\nreaction and an IgM antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent\nassay. Clinical, radiographic (magnetic resonance imaging),\nelectrophysiological, and 3-month functional outcome data were\ncollected.\nMain outcomes and measures. The detection of neurologic complications\nsecondary to ZIKV infection.\nResults. 40 patients (15 women and 25 men; median age, 44 years\nrange, 22-72 years) were enrolled, including 29 patients (73\npercent) with GBS (90 percent Brighton level 1 certainty), 7 (18\npercent) with encephalitis, 3 (8 percent) with transverse myelitis,\nand 1 (3 percent) with newly diagnosed chronic inflammatory\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy. Of these, 35 patients (88 percent) had\nmolecular and/or serologic evidence of recent ZIKV infection in the\nserum and/or cerebrospinal fluid. Of the patients positive for ZIKV\ninfection, 27 had GBS (18 demyelinating, 8 axonal, and 1 Miller Fisher\nsyndrome), 5 had encephalitis (3 with concomitant acute neuromuscular\ndisease), 2 had transverse myelitis, and 1 had chronic inflammatory\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy. Admission to the intensive care unit was\nrequired for 9 patients positive for ZIKV infection (26 percent), and\n5 (14 percent) required mechanical ventilation. Compared with\nadmission during the period from 5 Dec 2013 - 10 May 2014 (before the\nBrazilian outbreak of ZIKV), admissions for GBS increased from a mean\nof 1.0 per month to 5.6 per month, admissions for encephalitis\nincreased from 0.4 per month to 1.4 per month, and admissions for\ntransverse myelitis remained constant at 0.6 per month. At 3 months, 2\npatients positive for ZIKV infection (6 percent) died (1 with GBS and\n1 with encephalitis), 18 (51 percent) had chronic pain, and the median\nmodified Rankin score among survivors was 2 (range, 0-5).\nConclusions and relevance. In this single-center Brazilian cohort,\nZIKV infection was associated with an increase in the incidence of a\ndiverse spectrum of serious neurologic syndromes. The data also\nsuggest that serologic and molecular testing using blood and\ncerebrospinal fluid samples can serve as a less expensive, alternative\ndiagnostic strategy in developing countries, where plaque reduction\nneutralization testing is impractical. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) This study illustrates the need to consider post-Zika virus infection\nas a cause of a variety of neurological diseases.

We found that ZIKV\npersistently infects brain endothelial cells that normally protect\nneurons from viral exposure. hBMECs are not damaged by ZIKV infection\nand, analogous to persistent HCV infection, ZIKV constitutively\ninduces and evades antiviral ISG IFN-stimulated genes and IFN\ninterferon responses to continuously replicate in hBMECs. As a\nresult, hBMECs provide a protective niche for systemic ZIKV spread and\na viral reservoir localized in the normally protective blood-brain\nbarrier. Consistent with the spread of ZIKV into neuronal\ncompartments, ZIKV was released basolaterally from hBMECs. Our\nfindings define hBMEC responses that contribute to persistent ZIKV\ninfection and potential targets for clearing ZIKV infections from\nhBMECs.

PLoS\nPathog. 2017; 13(8): e1006487. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006487\n-\nAbstract\n\nStudies have demonstrated cross-reactivity of anti-dengue virus (DENV)\nantibodies in human sera against Zika virus (ZIKV), promoting\nincreased ZIKV infection in vitro. However, the correlation between in\nvitro and in vivo findings is not well characterized. Thus, we\nevaluated the impact of heterotypic flavivirus immunity on ZIKV titers\nin biofluids of rhesus macaques. Animals previously infected (420 days\nor longer) with DENV2, DENV4, or yellow fever virus were compared to\nflavivirus-naïve animals following infection with a Brazilian ZIKV\nstrain. Sera from DENV-immune macaques demonstrated cross-reactivity\nwith ZIKV by antibody-binding and neutralization assays prior to ZIKV\ninfection, and promoted increased ZIKV infection in cell culture\nassays. Despite these findings, no significant differences between\nflavivirus-naïve and immune animals were observed in viral titers,\nneutralizing antibody levels, or immune cell kinetics following ZIKV\ninfection. These results indicate that prior infection with\nheterologous flaviviruses neither conferred protection nor increased\nobserved ZIKV titers in this non-human primate ZIKV infection model. Author summary\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne, emerging flavivirus. In\naddition to asymptomatic or mild febrile manifestations, ZIKV\ninfection in humans is associated with comparatively rare congenital\nand neurological abnormalities. Previous in vitro studies have\ndemonstrated cross-reactivity of antibodies derived from dengue virus\ninfections with ZIKV, as well as antibody-mediated enhancement of\ninfection in cell culture. Therefore, there is concern among\nvaccinologists and the public health community that the more severe\ndisease manifestations could result from prior immunity, either from\nnatural infection or vaccination, to antigenically-related\nflaviviruses (such as, dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis).\nIn this study, we evaluated the impact of prior immunity to dengue or\nyellow fever virus on ZIKV infection in a non-human primate model.\nAfter confirming that our immune cohorts were capable of\nrecapitulating the published in vitro observations of cross-reactivity\nand enhancement, we looked for alteration of viral titers in\nperipheral blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, and vaginal\nsecretions, as well as alterations in gross pathology, clinical\nparameters, and immune response, as compared to our flavivirus-naïve\ncohort. Importantly, no significant differences between\nflavivirus-naïve and primed animals were observed in viral titers or\nbiofluid distribution, neutralizing antibody levels, or immune cell\nkinetics following ZIKV infection. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org)\nand\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be)(promed@promedmail.org) Previous dengue infection, whether acquired naturally or antibody\nelicited by vaccines, has been a concern due to the possibility of\nantibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) with more severe disease. This\nconcern also relates to Zika virus antibody from vaccination for\nenhancement of dengue virus infections with resulting more severe\ndisease. The monkey studies reported above indicated that this may not\nbe a problem for Zika virus vaccinated individuals. Another effort to\navoid ADE is development of a vaccine that has epitopes specific for\nZika virus that are not shared by other flaviviruses.

PLoS Pathog. 2017; 13(7): e1006537. doi:\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1006537\n-\nAbstract\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted virus that can cause\nsevere defects in an infected fetus. ZIKV is also transmitted by\nsexual contact, although the relative importance of sexual\ntransmission is unclear. To better understand the role of sexual\ntransmission in ZIKV pathogenesis, a nonhuman primate (NHP) model of\nvaginal transmission was developed. ZIKV was readily transmitted to\nmature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by vaginal inoculation was\nreadily transmitted to mature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by\nvaginal individual RM with 1-5 vaginal inoculations required to\nestablish infection. After treatment with Depoprovera, a widely used\ncontraceptive progestin, 2 RM that initially resisted 8 vaginal ZIKV\ninoculations became infected after one ZIKV inoculation. Thus,\nDepoprovera seemed to enhance susceptibility to vaginal ZIKV\ntransmission. Unexpectedly, the kinetics of virus replication and\ndissemination after intravaginal ZIKV inoculation were markedly\ndifferent from RM infected with ZIKV by subcutaneous (SQ) virus\ninoculation. Several groups have reported that after SQ ZIKV\ninoculation vRNA is rapidly detected in blood plasma with vRNA less\ncommon in urine and saliva and only rarely detected in female\nreproductive tract (FRT) secretions. In contrast, in vaginally\ninoculated RM, plasma vRNA is delayed for several days and ZIKV\nreplication in, and vRNA shedding from, the FRT was found in all 6\nanimals. Further, after intravaginal transmission ZIKV RNA shedding\nfrom FRT secretions was detected before or simultaneously with plasma\nvRNA, and persisted for at least as long. Thus, ZIKV replication in\nthe FRT was independent of, and often preceded virus replication in\nthe tissues contributing to plasma vRNA. These results support the\nconclusion that ZIKV preferentially replicates in the FRT after\nvaginal transmission, but not after SQ transmission, and raise the\npossibility that there is enhanced fetal infection and pathology after\nvaginal ZIKV transmission compared to a mosquito transmitted ZIKV. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{10}</strong> _Aedes albopictus_ populations as vectors.\nDate: 2 Aug 2017.\nSource: American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (edited)\n(http://www.ajtmh.org/content/journals/10.4269/ajtmh.16-0969) \nref: Azar SR, Roundy CM, Rossi SL, et al.

Positive saliva samples were assayed for\ninfectious titer. Although all 3 mosquito populations were susceptible\nto all ZIKV strains, rates of infection, dissemination, and\ntransmission differed among mosquito and virus strains. _Aedes\nalbopictus_ from Salvador, Brazil, were the least efficient vectors,\ndemonstrating susceptibility to infection to 2 American strains of\nZIKV but failing to shed virus in saliva. Mosquitoes from the Rio\nGrande Valley were the most efficient vectors and were capable of\nshedding all 3 tested ZIKV strains into saliva after 14 days of\nextrinsic incubation. In particular, ZIKV strain DakAR 41525 (Senegal\n1954) was significantly more efficient at dissemination and saliva\ndeposition than the others tested in Rio Grande mosquitoes.

Emerg Microbes\nInfect. 2017; 6(8): e69. doi: 10.1038/emi.2017.59\n-\nAbstract\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has recently been associated\nwith an increased incidence of neonatal microcephaly and other\nneurological disorders. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito\nbite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some\ncases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main\nvector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other\nmosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the\nvirus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit\nZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of\nlaboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_.\nInterestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the\nmidgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in\nRecife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially\nfed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced.\nCollectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range\nof ZIKV vectors than anticipated. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be) Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active\nvirus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their\nability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step\ntoward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_\nfed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in\nsaliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing.\nThe study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a\ncompetent vector.

The recent outbreaks of ZIKV in Brazil and French\nPolynesia have been linked to a considerable increase in the incidence\nof fetal microcephaly and other diseases such as Guillain-Barre\nsyndrome. Because there is currently no specific therapy or vaccine,\nthe early exploitation of a method to prevent expansion of ZIKV is a\nhigh priority. To validate commonly used antiviral drugs, we evaluated\nthe effect of ribavirin, a drug used to treat hepatitis C with\ninterferon-beta (IFN-beta), on ZIKV replication. In mammalian cells,\nwe observed an inhibitory effect of ribavirin on ZIKV replication and\nZIKV-induced cell death without cytotoxic effect. Furthermore, we\nfound that STAT1-deficient mice, which lack type I IFN signaling, were\nhighly sensitive to ZIKV infection and exhibited lethal outcome.\nRibavirin abrogated viremia in ZIKV-infected STAT-1-deficient mice.\nThese data suggest that the inhibition of viral RNA-dependent RNA\npolymerases may be effective for treatment of ZIKV infection. Our data\nprovide a new insight into the mechanisms for inhibition of ZIKV\nreplication and prevention of Zika fever. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) It will be interesting to see if these encouraging results showing\ninhibition of Zika virus replication can be replicated in non-human\nprimates. The challenge for use of drugs to inhibit Zika virus\ninfection in humans is that most (around 80 percent) Zika virus\ninfections are asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms. These\nindividuals will probably not seek medical treatment, even though\ntheir fetuses are at risk of infection with teratogenic effects. -\nMod.TY \n<br><br><strong>{3}</strong> Zika virus skewed immunosuppression.\nDate: Mon 21 Aug 2017.\nSource: Nature Microbiology journal (edited)\n(http://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-017-0016-3) \nref: Foo SS, Chen W, Chan Y, et al. Asian Zika virus strains target\nCD14+ blood monocytes and induce M2-skewed immunosuppression during\npregnancy. Nat Microbiol. 2017. doi: 10.1038/s41564-017-0016-3\n-\nAbstract\nBlood CD14+ monocytes are frontline immunomodulators categorized into\nclassical, intermediate or non-classical subsets, and subsequently\ndifferentiated into M1 pro- or M2 anti-inflammatory macrophages on\nstimulation. Although the Zika virus (ZIKV) rapidly establishes\nviraemia, the target cells and immune responses, particularly during\npregnancy, remain elusive. Furthermore, it is unknown whether African-\nand Asian-lineage ZIKV have different phenotypic impacts on host\nimmune responses. Using human blood infection, we identified CD14+\nmonocytes as the primary target for African- or Asian-lineage ZIKV\ninfection. When immunoprofiles of human blood infected with ZIKV were\ncompared, a classical/intermediate monocyte-mediated M1-skewed\ninflammation by the African-lineage ZIKV infection was observed, in\ncontrast to a non-classical monocyte-mediated M2-skewed\nimmunosuppression by the Asian-lineage ZIKV infection. Importantly,\ninfection of the blood of pregnant women revealed an enhanced\nsusceptibility to ZIKV infection. Specifically, Asian-lineage ZIKV\ninfection of pregnant women's blood led to an exacerbated M2-skewed\nimmunosuppression of non-classical monocytes in conjunction with a\nglobal suppression of type I interferon-signaling pathway and an\naberrant expression of host genes associated with pregnancy\ncomplications. Also, 30 ZIKV+ sera from symptomatic pregnant patients\nshowed elevated levels of M2-skewed immunosuppressive cytokines and\npregnancy-complication-associated fibronectin-1. This study\ndemonstrates the differential immunomodulatory responses of blood\nmonocytes, particularly during pregnancy, on infection with different\nlineages of ZIKV. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{4}</strong> Virus alters mosquito genes.\nDate: Tue 22 Aug 2017.\nSource: bioRxiv journal (edited)\n(http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/22/179416) \nref: Etebari K, Hegde S, Saldana MA, et al. Global transcriptome\nanalysis of _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes in response to Zika virus\ninfection. bioRxiv 179416; doi:10.1101/179416\n-\nZika virus (ZIKV) of the Flaviviridae family is a recently emerged\nmosquito-borne virus that has been implicated in the surge of the\nnumber of microcephaly instances in South America. The recent rapid\nspread of the virus led to its declaration as a global health\nemergency by the World Health Organization. The virus is transmitted\nmainly by the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_ that also vectors dengue virus,\nhowever little is known about the interactions of the virus with the\nmosquito vector. In this study, we investigated the transcriptome\nprofiles of whole _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes in response to ZIKV\ninfection at 2, 7, and 14 days post-infection using RNA-Seq. Results\nshowed changes in the abundance of a large number of transcripts at\neach time point following infection, with 18 transcripts commonly\nchanged among the 3 time points. Gene ontology analysis revealed that\nmost of the altered genes are involved in metabolic process, cellular\nprocess and proteolysis. In addition, 486 long intergenic non-coding\nRNAs were identified altered upon ZIKV infection. Further, we found\ncorrelational changes of a number of potential mRNA target genes with\nthat of altered host microRNAs. The outcomes provide a basic\nunderstanding of _Ae. aegypti_ responses to ZIKV and helps to\ndetermine host factors involved in replication or mosquito host\nanti-viral response against the virus. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) Mosquito vector competence depends on the relationship of virus and\nthe mosquito, and the defenses that the mosquito can mobilize against\nthe virus infection. Studies, such as the one above, can document the\nchanges that occur when the virus infects the mosquito, and if\ndifferences in relative vector efficiency of different geographic\nstrains of this mosquito might be related to alternations in mosquito\ngenes when infected. It would be interesting to know if these gene\nchanges affect fitness, and especially longevity of infected\nmosquitoes. - Mod.TY \n<br><br><strong>{5}</strong> Virus effects on sperm, body fluids.\nDate: Mon 21 Aug 2017.\nSource: The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal (edited)\n(http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(17)30444-9/abstract) \nref: Joguet G, Mansuy JM, Matusali G, et al.

To investigate the effects of Zika\nvirus infection on semen and clearance of Zika virus from semen and\nbody fluids, we aimed to study a cohort of Zika virus-infected men. Methods\nThis prospective observational study recruited men presenting with\nacute Zika virus infection at Pointe-Ã -Pitre University Hospital in\nGuadeloupe, French Caribbean, where a Zika virus outbreak occurred\nbetween April and November, 2016. Blood, urine, and semen were\ncollected at days 7, 11, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 after symptom onset,\nand semen characteristics, such as total sperm count, sperm motility,\nvitality, and morphology, and reproductive hormone concentrations,\nsuch as testosterone, inhibin, follicle-stimulating hormone, and\nluteinising hormone, were assessed. At days 7, 11, and 20, semen was\nprocessed to isolate motile spermatozoa. Zika virus RNA was detected\nby RT-PCR using whole blood, serum, urine, seminal plasma, semen\ncells, and motile spermatozoa fractions. Zika virus was isolated from\ndifferent sperm fractions on Vero E6 cultures. Findings\n15 male volunteers (mean age 35 years SD 5; range 25-44) with acute\nZika virus infection and positive Zika virus RNA detection in blood or\nurine were enrolled. Total sperm count was decreased from median\n119âÃâ10^6 spermatozoa (IQR interquartile range 22-234)\nat day 7, to 45.2âÃâ10^6 (16.5-89.6) at day 30, and 70\nÃ 10^6 (28.5-81.4) at day 60, respectively, after Zika virus\ninfection. Inhibin values increased from 93.5 pg/mL (IQR 55-162) at\nday 7 to 150 pg/mL (78-209) at day 120 when total sperm count\nrecovered. In motile spermatozoa obtained after density gradient\nseparation, Zika virus RNA was found in 3 of 14 patients at day 7, 4\nof 15 at day 11, and 4 of 15 at day 20, and replication-competent\nvirus was found in the tested patient. Seminal shedding kinetics\nseemed heterogeneous among patients. Whole blood was the fluid most\nfrequently positive for Zika virus RNA (62 of 92 samples) and 3\npatients remained positive at day 120. Interpretation\nSemen alterations early after acute Zika virus infection might affect\nfertility and could be explained by virus effects on the testis and\nepididymis. Frequency of shedding and high viral load in semen,\ntogether with the presence of replicative virus in a motile\nspermatozoa fraction, can lead to Zika virus transmission during\nsexual contact and assisted reproduction procedures. Whole blood seems\nto be the best specimen for Zika virus RNA detection, diagnosis, and\nfollow-up. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall In a new study that included 12 men in French Guiana who had Zika\nvirus, 4 never had any detectable Zika in their semen, 1 excreted Zika\nvirus in his semen for at least 3 days, and 7 had Zika virus in semen\nfor at least 1 month.

Vaccines protect fetus from Zika. JAMA. 2017; 318(8):\n689. doi:10.1001/jama.2017.11200\n-\nResearchers funded in part by the National Institutes of Health have\nrecently demonstrated that 2 experimental vaccines can restrict\ntransmission of Zika virus from pregnant mice to their fetuses,\nthereby shielding offspring from congenital damage or death. Multiple candidate Zika vaccines have been shown protective against\ninfection with the virus in animal studies, with several now in human\ntrials, but none were tested in the context of pregnancy, according to\nthe authors of the study published in Cell\n(http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(17)30759-6). The 2\nvaccine candidates investigated in the new study are the 1st to\ndemonstrate efficacy in preventing vertical transmission of the virus\nand related fetal death in an animal model. Although the vaccines were\nadministered to female mice prior to pregnancy, the result is\nconsidered an important step toward developing a vaccine that could be\nsafely given to pregnant women. One of the 2 candidates is a modified messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine\nencoding Zika genes, developed by the biotechnology company Moderna.\nIt is already in safety trials in women who are not pregnant. The\nother is a live-attenuated Zika strain developed by researchers at the\nUniversity of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). The testing was carried out by scientists from the National Institute\nof Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Washington University School of\nMedicine, and UTMB. The researchers 1st vaccinated the mice with 1 of\nthe vaccines or a placebo. After mating, the animals were challenged\nwith the virus 6 days into pregnancy. A week later, more than 50\npercent of placentas and fetuses from mice administered the mRNA\nvaccine had virtually no Zika RNA. The remainder had \"substantially\nlower\" levels relative to placebo.\nThe live vaccine provided broader protection: 78 percent of placentas\nand 83 percent of fetuses had Zika RNA at or below the level of\ndetection, while the placebo group exhibited significantly higher\nlevels of placental and fetal Zika RNA. Mice vaccinated with either\nvaccine had significantly higher rates of fetal viability; whereas 100\npercent of fetuses from mice vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine were\nborn, none survived to term in the placebo group. A working group funded by the Wellcome Trust recently approved ethical\nguidelines for testing such vaccines in pregnant women, normally\nexcluded from drug trials. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) It is reassuring to learn that at least 2 vaccines are now entering\nclinical trials in women. Although anti-Zika virus drugs are under\ndevelopment, preventing infection through vaccination seems to be the\nmost effective measure to prevent fetal infection and adverse effects\nof the virus infection in adults. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Qatar":{},"Romania":{"13":{"title":"Measles update (41): Europe (Finland, Italy) ","date":["17","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Measles update (41): Europe (Finland, Italy) [EXTERNAL]","summary":"\nMEASLES UPDATE (41): EUROPE (FINLAND, ITALY)\n\nA ProMED-mail post\n(http://www.promedmail.org)\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n(http://www.isid.org) In this update:\nEurope\n\n<br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Finland\n<br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Italy\n<br><br><strong>{3}</strong> Italy \nEurope\n<br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Finland.\nDate: Thu 17 Aug 2017.\nSource: Eurosurveillance 2017;22(33) (edited)\n(http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=22857) \nA cluster of measles linked to an imported case, Finland, 2017\n\nSeppälä E, Zöldi V, Vuorinen S, Murtopuro S, et al. A young Italian adult was diagnosed with measles in Finland in June\n2017. During the stay in Finland and subsequent travel to Estonia, the\ncase exposed altogether several hundred persons to measles. As of Fri\n11 Aug 2017, 5 secondary cases of measles have been detected. As the\ninvestigation is still ongoing, we present here the preliminary\nfindings and implemented control measures regarding this cluster of\nmeasles. Description of the cluster\n\nIndex Case 1 was a young Italian adult who arrived in Finland on Sun\n11 Jun 2017 and attended an international camp in Finland from 12 to\n25 Jun 2017 (Figure 1 for Figures/Tables, see original URL -\nMod.LL). After developing fever and respiratory symptoms on Fri 16 Jun 2017\nand rash on Wed 21 Jun 2017, Case 1 was admitted to the hospital of\nCity A and was isolated and monitored because enterovirus infection or\nmeasles was suspected. Serum and throat specimens were taken on Thu\n22 Jun 2017. While the confirmatory laboratory results were still\npending, the case was discharged and returned to the camp premises on\nSat 24 Jun 2017. On Sun 25 Jun 2017, Case 1 traveled to Helsinki\nby train (without a designated seat, 3.5 hours) and to Tallinn by\nferry (no cabin booked, 2.5 hours), staying one night before flying\nback to Italy. On Tue 27 Jun 2017, Case 1 was laboratory-confirmed\nfor measles infection. The case self-reported to be vaccinated with 2\ndoses of measles-containing vaccine; however, the laboratory results\ncontradicted this as the case tested negative for measles-specific IgG\nantibodies (Table). Subsequently, 5 secondary cases of measles were identified (Figures 1\nand 2). 4 of them were laboratory-confirmed (Cases 2, 4, 5 and 6).\nCase 3 was classified as a probable case (no laboratory testing\nbecause of parental objection). Cases 2 and 3 were adolescent siblings\nliving in City A. Both attended a summer camp organized at the same\npremises as the international camp. Both were placed in home\nisolation. Case 4 was a person working in a cafeteria in City B who\nhad visited the camp premises on Mon 19 Jun 2017. Cases 2, 3 and 4\nhad lunch in the same canteen used by other camp attendees including\nCase 1. Epidemiological investigations for Case 5 are still ongoing\nbut so far no link between other cases has been established. It is\npossible that there is an unknown case in the transmission chain. Case\n6 was a close contact of Case 5, identified during contact tracing.\nThe case had been vaccinated with 2 doses of the measles-mumps-rubella\n(MMR) vaccine in childhood; all other secondary cases were\nunvaccinated (Table). Laboratory findings\n-\nHealthcare providers were asked to send all clinical samples from\nsuspected measles cases to the measles reference laboratory of the\nFinnish National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL). Measles\nsequences available for 5 cases were identical and genotyped as D8\n(Table). Based on the Measles Nucleotide Surveillance database, this\nstrain was identical to strains isolated in Italy during 2017 and to a\nstrain identified in a British traveler, and it shared very high\nnucleotide similarity () 99.78 percent) with more than 600 sequences\ndetected on 5 continents between 2015 and 2017, indicating recent\nglobal spread of nearly identical measles viruses 1,2. 6 suspected\ncases were discarded after laboratory analysis. In addition, 3\npotentially exposed, asymptomatic people tested negative for measles. Conclusion\n\nIn Finland, a country with nationally high MMR vaccination coverage,\nextensive outbreaks of measles are unlikely to occur.

A large measles outbreak has been ongoing in Milan and surrounding\nareas, a densely populated area with nearly 4 million inhabitants.\nRapid and active surveillance was set up by the Subnational Reference\nLaboratories (SRL) Milan, established as part of the measles and\nrubella surveillance network MoRoNet <br><br><strong>{1}</strong> in March 2017, with 303\ninvestigated cases at the time of submission of this report. We\npresent a detailed analysis of the period 1 Mar 2017 to 30 Jun 2017,\nwith the aim to conduct a complete and rapid characterization of\nwild-type measles virus (MV) strains circulating. Confirmation and investigation of cases and clusters in Milan\n\nFrom 1 Mar to 30 Jun 2017, 233 suspected cases of measles were\ninvestigated: there were 203 (87 percent) laboratory-confirmed cases\n(median age: 30 years; range: 2 months-77 years) and 30 (13 percent)\nwere discarded. Overall 60 percent (n = 121) of the confirmed\ncases were individuals aged 15-39 years and 6 percent (n = 12)\nwere ≤ 1 year of age; 88 percent (n = 179) were not\nvaccinated and 12 percent (n = 24) were vaccinated (6 with 2 doses\nof measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, 10 with one dose, and 8 did\nnot know the number of doses). According to the epidemiological\nregional database, 108 of 203 were sporadic cases and 95 were related\nto 47 clusters. Cases were classified as sporadic when an\nepidemiological link to other cases could not be established. Molecular surveillance for cases and clusters\n\nThe genotype of MV strains was successfully identified in 187 of 203\n(92 percent) of the confirmed cases by sequencing the highly variable\nregion of nucleoprotein (N) gene (N-450) <br><br><strong>{2}</strong>. Phylogenetic analysis\nrevealed that the MV strains belonged to genotypes D8 and B3. The most\ncommon genotype detected was genotype D8 (86 percent; 160/187 cases)\nwhich was related to 77 cases in 42 clusters and 83 sporadic cases.\nAll of the D8 cases and clusters were autochthonous or from unknown\nsource. In March 2017, the B3 genotype was detected in 5 imported cases: 2\nsporadic cases and 3 cases which subsequently caused 3 import-related\nclusters. From Apr 2017 to end of Jun 2017, a further 14 autochthonous\nsporadic cases and one cluster were reported. The geographical and\ntemporal distribution, respectively, of sporadic cases and clusters\nrelated to D8 and B3 genotypes are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2 for\nFigures, see original URL - Mod.LL. Measles virus genotype D8\n\nPhylogenetic analysis showed that all the D8 sequences (n = 160)\nfell into the Osaka lineage (MVi/Osaka.JPN/29.15; similarity range:\n99-100 percent). From March to May, D8 MV strains mainly caused\nclusters in work and family settings, which occurred principally in\nthe north-eastern area of Milan. During the week starting on Mon 27\nMar 2017, a serious family cluster affected 3 cases causing the death\nof one of them. The D8 MV strain was isolated from the biological\nsamples of one of these cases. In Jun 2017, the D8 Osaka variant spread through the city of Milan and\ncaused a nosocomial cluster in a hospital. Based on epidemiological\ndata, a link was established between 12 cases: 8 healthcare workers\n(HCWs), 3 patients and one visitor. Phylogenetic analysis showed that\nthe 9 sequences obtained were 100 percent identical. The match of\nepidemiological data and phylogenetic analysis highlighted a single\ntransmission chain for all cases (Figure 3). Measles virus genotype B3\n\nPhylogenetic analysis showed that all B3 sequences (n = 27) were\nidentical to the variant Dublin (MVs/Dublin.IRL/8.16; similarity: 100\npercent) which is circulating in European countries and responsible\nfor an ongoing epidemic in Romania <br><br><strong>{3}</strong>. The B3 Dublin variant was 1st\nintroduced in the east of Milan at the beginning of March 2017, and\nthere was an epidemiological link to the Roma community in France. By\nthe end of March 2017, this variant was detected in a sporadic case\nreturning from Piedmont (northern Italy). Subsequently, the same\nvariant was isolated in a cluster caused by an index case returning\nfrom the Apulia Region (southern Italy) and in a cluster that was\nimported from Romania. In April 2017, genotype B3 was identified in a\nsporadic case returning from the Lazio Region (central Italy). During May 2017 and June 2017, 12 autochthonous cases were notified in\nthe eastern and south-eastern suburbs of Milan. In June 2017, 3\nnosocomial clusters were identified in an emergency department.\nAlthough initially reported as unrelated clusters, the phylogenetic\nanalysis showed a single source of transmission (n = 7, 2 HCWs, 4\npatients, and one visitor) (Figure 3). Conclusions\n\nEliminating measles and rubella is a core goal of World Health\nOrganization European Region Member States. Effective surveillance is\nessential for eliminating measles and rubella and its verification\n<br><br><strong>{4}</strong>. Since the beginning of 2017 and up to Sun 6 Aug 2017, the\nItalian Ministry of Health has reported 4087 cases of measles and 3\ndeaths. Most cases occurred in Piedmont and Lombardy (northern Italy),\nTuscany, Lazio and Abruzzo (central Italy) and Sicily (southern\nItaly). Most were older than 15 years (median age: 27 years) and 89\npercent of the cases were not vaccinated. Overall, 42 percent of the\ncases were hospitalized and 277 cases were reported among HCWs <br><br><strong>{5}</strong>. Timely measles surveillance is critical to disease control.\nIdentifying and confirming suspected measles cases through\nsurveillance allows early detection of outbreaks and analysis of\nongoing transmission in order to mount more effective vaccination\nmeasures. MV genotyping can play an important role in tracking\ntransmission pathways during outbreak investigations <br><br><strong>{6}</strong>. From March to June 2017, the genotypes D8 and B3 co-circulated in\nMilan and surrounding areas. The most common genotype detected was\ngenotype D8, related to 83 sporadic cases and 42 clusters. The high\nsimilarity between the D8 MV strains, all belonging to the Osaka\nlineage, suggests a unique initiating transmission event. This is the\n1st evidence of the Osaka D8 variant in northern Italy, which seems to\nbe replacing the D8 variants that had been circulating in this area\nsince 2013 7,8. Moreover, our data show multiple imported cases of\nB3 MV strains which subsequently spread across Italy and caused\nseveral autochthonous cases and clusters. The B3 Dublin variant has\nreplaced the B3 variant Como that had been present in this Italian\narea from August 2015 to November 2016 <br><br><strong>{9}</strong>. By the end of June 2017, D8 MV strains and B3 MV strains had caused\nclusters in 2 major Milanese hospitals. In August (current month)\n2017, the epidemic is still ongoing and the number of notified cases\nduring the month of July was almost twice the number of cases notified\nin June 2017. Other authors have already reported that where there\nis evidence of both nosocomial and community transmission of measles,\nnosocomial transmission appeared to precede community transmission\nwith a peak of hospital-acquired cases occurring almost 2 weeks before\nthe peak of the community outbreak <br><br><strong>{10}</strong>. In conclusion, the suboptimal immunization level (92.5 percent\nvaccination coverage rate in Lombardy Region; <br><br><strong>{11}</strong>) and the consequent\naccumulation of susceptible population have led to an increase in the\ntransmission of measles in northern Italy with detrimental effects on\nboth public health and ongoing measles elimination efforts.\nFurthermore, the nosocomial outbreaks highlight the importance of\nimproving measles vaccination coverage of healthcare workers.

Measles vaccination coverage is suboptimal in Italy (ranging between\n85.4 percent and 90.6 percent for one dose during the period\n2007-2016) <br><br><strong>{1}</strong>, which has led to large pockets of susceptible adults.\nWe describe an outbreak in an Italian hospital between February and\nApril 2017 among healthcare workers (HCW), hospital support personnel\n(hospital workers in activities not involving direct contact with\npatients), hospital visitors and community contacts. This outbreak was\npart of a wider epidemic in Italy that started in January 2017 and\nhas, as at Sun 30 Jul 2017, led to 4001 cases nationwide (275 in\nHCW) <br><br><strong>{2}</strong>. Outbreak description\n\nA HCW was referred to the emergency department (ED) of an Italian\nhospital for a rash developed after taking antibacterials for a mild\ncough and coryza. The rash was considered an allergic reaction to the\nantibacterial and the HCW was admitted to the hospital inpatient\nclinic. Three days later, the HCW's child was admitted to hospital for\na rash diagnosed as due to a non-communicable systemic disease. Subsequent serology showed that both the HCW and the child had\nmeasles. The origin of the infection for the index case is still\nunknown. It should be noted, however, that at least 10 community cases\nof measles occurred in the same period in the area of residence of the\nHCW. Using the standard case definition of the European Commission <br><br><strong>{3}</strong>, a\ntotal of 34 measles cases during the following weeks were identified\nby tracing the contacts of the index case. Among them, 15 were HCWs, 5\nwere support personnel, 4 were hospital visitors and 11 were community\ncontacts of the above cases. The secondary cases to the index (n = 8) occurred in 2 of the\nHCW's relatives, in 4 other HCWs, and in 2 support workers who were\nnot immediately recognized as belonging to the hospital outbreak. One\nof the secondary cases, a HCW, was in service until the onset of\nsymptoms, accessing all rooms on 2 inpatient wards. Tertiary cases\n(n = 6) involved the family of this HCW, 3 HCWs and a member of\nsupport personnel. A total of 2 weeks after the admission of the index case, 2 of the\nHCWs belonging to tertiary cases presented during the night to the ED\nwhere they stayed for nearly 10 hours. An additional 15 cases could be\ntraced following this single exposure window, namely 7 HCWs, 2 support\nworkers, 3 relatives of theirs and 3 visitors to the ED during the\ntime the 2 HCWs were present. One more community case was related to\ncontact outside hospital with one of the tertiary HCW cases.\nAdditional cases were related to a visitor at one of the involved\ninpatient wards, who probably got in contact with one of the tertiary\ncases who were HCW during the incubation period and generated 3 cases\nin the community, among them a family pediatrician. Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the epidemic curve and the outbreak tree\nfor figures, see original URL - Mod.LL. Characteristics of cases\n-\nUp to 6 cases occurred in children up to 9 years of age, while 2\noccurred in adolescents between 10 and 17 years and the majority of\ncases (n = 27) in adults 18 years and older. Figure 3 describes\nthe age distribution among different categories of cases. Vaccination status was known for 24 cases. Sixteen were unvaccinated\n(2 children, 14 adults), 2 had received one dose, one a full course of\n2 doses, and 5 cases occurred in contacts who received one dose of\npost-exposure vaccination. Of the 5 contacts who received post\nexposure vaccine, one was an infant younger than one year for whom\ninformation about the date of vaccination is not available; for the\nother 4, the delay between presumed contact date and immunization was\n3 days in 2 cases, 6 and 12 days for the remaining 2 cases. Among the\nHCWs, 2 were vaccinated, 11 were unvaccinated and for 2 of them the\ndata was unavailable. Among the 5 cases belonging to support personnel\n2 were unvaccinated and the status was unknown for the remaining 3. Genotyping was available for 3 cases: genotype B3, subtype 3.1 was\nfound in all of them. Conclusion and recommendations\n\nMeasles elimination in Europe, despite the immunization efforts, is\nstill jeopardized by recurrent outbreaks in susceptible populations\n4-7. Nosocomial transmission of measles is an important and emerging\nway of spreading the infection 8-11. Anyone staying in the hospital\nenvironment, regardless of role, can be affected because measles is\nhighly contagious and persists in the environment for up to 2 hours,\nthus requiring appropriate and timely infection control measures\n12,13.\nConsidering that transmission may occur 3 days before the onset of\nrash, early diagnosis when only non-specific preliminary symptoms\n(cough, coryza and conjunctivitis) are present is crucial for\ncontaining the outbreak <br><br><strong>{14}</strong>.\nA single exposure window, that occurred 2 weeks after the admission of\nthe index case, when 2 cases were present in the ED, resulted in\nfurther 15 cases. \nAppropriate procedures are needed for patients with suspect\ntransmissible infection in the ED, an issue not limited to measles but\nshared with several other highly infective conditions <br><br><strong>{13}</strong>.\nA 2-dose vaccination is the most effective measure to prevent measles\n<br><br><strong>{15}</strong>. This is of crucial importance for HCWs, with a view to their\nhigher risk of exposure and of transmission to vulnerable patients. However, it should be noted that in at least 5 cases in this outbreak,\nmeasles occurred in personnel working in the hospital environment in\nsupport functions, highlighting the need to take into consideration\nthe role of such personnel in the spread of the infection. Given that\nmost of the support personnel belong to outsourced services,\ncoordination is needed between occupational health unit and\noccupational health responsible of outsourced services. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) The full report can be found at the source URL. - Mod.ML There is no doubt that inadequate immunization levels are the major\ncontributor to outbreaks of measles. Most of this is due to not\nreceiving the 2 doses of vaccine due to personal or parenteral choice.\nAggressive programs to reverse this unfortunate trend are needed to\nprevent outbreaks of this potentially lethal disease. The nosocomial\nsetting as reflected in the 3rd post represents a special case\nsituation. It is not clear why health care workers are not required to\nbe immunized for measles. Additionally, when a case of measles is\nintroduced into a health care facility, it has been my experience that\nthe infection is not recognized promptly to minimize nosocomial\nspread. - Mod.LL  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at:\n(http://healthmap.org/promed/p/75).

Measles outbreaks have been registered in all 41 counties,\nthe most affected  with over 1000 cases each  being Timis (1215\ncases), Caras-Severin (1110), and Arad (1002). The measles outbreak in Romania in 2016 is not circumstantial, but a\ndirect consequence of the \"major\" malfunctions in public policy\nregarding vaccination, minister of health Florian Bodog stated on Fri\n11 Aug in a press release. \"For years now Romania has been below the\nsafety threshold of vaccination coverage. That is, the risk of a\nmeasles outbreak was imminent. Which is what actually happened. The\noutbreak of the measles epidemic in 2016 is not conjectural, it is a\ndirect consequence of major malfunctions in the public policy on\nvaccination,\" the minister of health stated. According to him, the Vaccination Law corrects the irregularities that\nled to the epidemic, providing the best conditions for protecting\nchildren's health. \"For Romania, the stake of the vaccination bill is\nhuge. Ensuring a healthy future for 4 million children lies in our\nhands. The Romanian parliament, the highest institution of democracy,\nwill decide on the final content of this law. However, beyond the\ndebates in parliament, it is important that all the public opinion be\ninformed and understand the true meaning of the law and the profound\nchanges it brings. (..) We have a moral duty towards our children, to\nprevent harm before it happens. As we also have a moral duty to the\ncommunity in which we live to prevent harm before it happens to other\nchildren or parents,\" Bodog said, quoted in the press release. He added that any bill is amendable and that is why it is open to any\npublic debates as long as they are carried out with honesty, good\nsense and decency. \"But this project is the day-to-day work of\nspecialists in the field of vaccination and who have faced all the\nflaws of the current framework. That is why the law has been carefully\nand correctly thought through by those who best understand how to\nregulate the vaccination policy,\" the minister of health also said. The bill on the organisation and funding of public vaccination in\nRomania was adopted by the government on Wed 9 Aug 2017. The bill\nwas submitted to parliament for debate and adoption. The normative act\nwould come into force on 1 Jan 2018. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) A similar report can be found in El Pais (12 Aug 2017) which states\nin addition that, of the 95 per cent vaccine coverage recommended by\nthe World Health Organization (WHO), 86 per cent have been\nvaccinated since 2007, according to its national epidemiological\ncentre. \"Highly worrying\" figures, acknowledged the prime minister,\nMihai Tudose, this week. \"More than 180 000 children in our country,\nfrom 9 months to 9 years, are not immunized against measles. In some\nregions, the rate of immunization of the 2nd dose does not reach 50\nper cent; and this is very serious.\" Timis and Caras-Severin, Arad\n(all to the west of the country, near the border with Serbia or\nHungary), are the most affected, with more than 1000 measles cases\neach, reported in the last 10 months when the outbreak was declared. According to official estimates, nearly 50 000 children without\nimmunization are not even registered with a family doctor. Most is due\nto serious problems of social exclusion.

The 6 people are now\nout of danger, and the 4 hospitalised patients were able to return\nhome, says the regional Agency of health (ARS), Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes,\ncited by France Bleu. These are all people who live or work in this\nsmall town of 1100 habitats. The ARS called for vigilance and prompted the inhabitants of the\nnorthern Ardèche, to consult a doctor in case of fever and appearance\nof buttons rash. It alerted on the very high contagiousness of the\nvirus that can infect up to 20 people around a sick person, and they\ncan produce severe, even life-threatening disease  in fact, there is\nno curative treatment for measles. In addition, the ARS has been reported to France Bleu that the recent\nconfirmed cases of measles in Ardoix were unvaccinated. According to\nthe figures of the LRA, 71 per cent of the inhabitants of the Ardèche\nregion are vaccinated against measles, which is 10 per cent less than\nthe national average. The government has confirmed its willingness to make mandatory 8\nvaccines, including measles. On this disease, \"Vaccination coverage\namong children at 2 years of age reaches only 78 per cent. As long as\nit does not reach the 95 per cent the risk of epidemic wave periodic\nwill persist\", has declared Agnès Buzyn. Measles has made its 1st victim in France at the end of July 2017.

The index case had just returned from visiting family in the Ukraine\nwhere he likely contracted the disease. When he returned to Israel he\nvisited a clinic where he infected 8 other soldiers who were waiting\nin line to see a physician. \"The IDF, together with the Health\nMinistry, carried out an investigation to locate the cases and\nidentify the source of the infection,\" the army said in a statement,\nadding that all those who had contact with the soldiers had been\ngiven preventative treatment. An IDF spokesman told The Jerusalem Post\nthat the soldier who contracted the disease had 2 stopovers in Europe\non his way back to Israel from the Ukraine but was not able to specify\nwhich countries. WHO in March 2017 warned of a measles outbreak sweeping across\nEurope in places where immunization rates have plummeted. The figures\ncover the agency's entire European region  53 countries including\nIsrael, Kazakhstan, and Russia. According to WHO 559 measles cases\nwere reported in Europe between January and March 2017. While the\nlargest current measles outbreaks in Europe were reported in Romania\nand Italy, other countries reporting cases were France, Germany,\nPoland, Switzerland, and the Ukraine. \"With steady progress toward\nelimination over the past 2 years, it is of particular concern that\nmeasles cases are climbing in Europe,\" said Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO\nregional director for Europe. \"Today's travel patterns put no person\nor country beyond the reach of the measles virus. Outbreaks will\ncontinue in Europe, as elsewhere, until every country reaches the\nlevel of immunization needed to fully protect their populations.\" Israeli children are routinely immunized with the MMR measles, mumps,\nrubella vaccine which are given in 2 doses, at 1 year and a booster\nin the 1st grade. The Health Ministry has stated that the level of\nvaccine coverage in Israel is among the highest in the West, with 97\nper cent coverage for 1st and 2nd doses MMR and chickenpox vaccine. While no vaccine is 100 per cent effective, an infectious disease\nspecialist told the Post that measles is \"a nasty illness\" that is\npreventable by proper immunization. But while it is highly recommended\nby medical professionals and the Health Ministry, the vaccine is not\nmandatory and according to the IDF the measles vaccine is not part of\nthe vaccines given to new recruits. \"We cannot afford to have soldiers\nwho are severely ill with a highly contagious disease. It would be\nappropriate for the IDF to verify and update immunizations of all\npersonnel and new recruits,\" the infectious disease specialist told\nthe Post. Measles is spread by coughing and sneezing and close contact with\ninfected individuals. While most infected people usually experience\nonly mild symptoms it is one of the leading causes of death among\nyoung children globally. Measles takes about 8-12 days following\ncontact before the individual will show symptoms which include a\nfever, bad cough, red eyes, and a runny nose. A few days after the\nrespiratory symptoms, the infected individual will get a bad rash.\nOther complications of measles include gastroenteritis (diarrhea and\nvomiting), pneumonia, severe bleeding problems, and in some rare cases\nencephalitis (brain infections). In June 2017, 5 cases of measles were reported to the Health\nMinistry  all of them women between the ages of 20-40 who lived in\nJerusalem. byline: Anna Ahronheim \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) Even with 97 per cent vaccine coverage, measles virus can cause small\noutbreaks.

Measles is an airborne disease that affects mostly children between\nthe ages of 6 months and 10 years, although it can also affect\nadults. Although Prof Mbonye said there was no cause for alarm, he urged the\npublic to be vigilant and report any suspected cases to the nearest\nhealth facilities. The public has also been urged to look out for\ncommon early symptoms associated with the disease, which include high\nfever, cough, red swelling eyelids and muscle and body irritability. According to the Ministry of Health, an estimated 20 per cent of\npeople who get infected with measles often develop complications,\nwhich if not managed early enough can lead to death. Despite previous\nmass vaccination campaigns, Uganda has had several outbreaks of the\ndisease. Prof Mbonye blamed it on parents who do not take their\nchildren for immunisation at the right time. Current national\nimmunisation coverage stands at 85 per cent. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) According to WHO, in 2016 global vaccination coverage (all vaccines)\nwas stalled at 86 per cent, with no significant changes during the\npast year. For measles alone, by the end of 2016, 85 per cent of\nchildren had received 1 dose of vaccine by their 2nd birthday, and 164\ncountries had included a 2nd dose as part of routine immunization; 64\nper cent of children received 2 doses of measles vaccine according to\nnational immunization schedules. It is generally thought that because\nmeasles is such a highly transmissible disease, that 90-95 per cent of\npeople must be vaccinated in order to protect the entire population,\nor achieve herd immunity.

The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare is advising tourists to go to hospital if they develop a high fever or generalized rash after returning to Japan.  Although the World Health Organization verified that Japan has eliminated infections of endemic measles strains in 2015, group infections originating from people who contracted the disease abroad are spreading in the country. As of 6 Aug 2017, the number of patients reached 169 this year in Japan, already eclipsing the figure in the previous year.  About 4100 patients in Italy and around 6500 patients in Romania have already been confirmed as of August 2017 compared with about 860 and 2000, respectively, throughout 2016, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.  Symptoms of the highly contagious disease include runny nose, red and watery eyes, high fever, and rash. The virus is spread through coughing and sneezing and can cause complications such as pneumonia and can even result in death in one in 1000 patients, according to the ministry. The ministry recommends people traveling overseas to check their vaccination records and take an additional shot if they have only been vaccinated once.  The disease was prevalent about a decade ago in Japan with the number of patients soaring to over 10 000 in 2008 but the country was later considered as free from infections of the virus.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Japan can be found at (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/156). - Mod.LK   <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Australia (Perth, Western Australia): ex Italy.

Large measles outbreak introduced by asylum seekers and spread among the insufficiently vaccinated resident population, Berlin, October 2014 to August 2015. Euro Surveill. 2017; 22(34): pii=30599 - Abstract  The largest measles outbreak in Berlin since 2001 occurred from October 2014 to August 2015. Overall, 1344 cases were ascertained, 86 per cent (with available information) unvaccinated, including 146 (12 per cent) asylum seekers. Median age was 17 years (interquartile range: 4-29 years), 26 per cent were hospitalised and a 1 year old child died. Measles virus genotyping uniformly revealed the variant 'D8-Rostov-Don' and descendants. The virus was likely introduced by and initially spread among asylum seekers before affecting Berlin's resident population. Among Berlin residents, the highest incidence was in children younger than 2 years, yet most cases (52 per cent) were adults. Post-exposure vaccinations in homes for asylum seekers, not always conducted, occurred later (median: 7.5 days) than the recommended 72 hours after onset of the 1st case and reached only half of potential contacts. Asylum seekers should not only have non-discriminatory, equitable access to vaccination, they also need to be offered measles vaccination in a timely fashion, that is, immediately upon arrival in the receiving country. Supplementary immunisation activities targeting the resident population, particularly adults, are urgently needed in Berlin.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail.

Source: Romania Insider (edited) (https://www.romania-insider.com/measles-kills-iraqi-refugee/)   The ongoing measles outbreak keeps making victims in Romania. A 10 month old girl, who was a refugee from Iraq, became the 33rd person to die of the infection, reports local Digi24. The girl arrived in Romania on 7 Jul 2017 with her family, and the doctors diagnosed her with measles in August. They also discovered that the child was suffering from malnutrition and severe psychomotor retardation.  The measles outbreak is still a major problem in Romania, with more than 8900 cases reported across the country until 25 Aug 2017, including 33 deaths, according to data from the National Center for Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases (CNSCBT). Most deaths were registered in Timis (9), Dolj (7), and Arad (6) counties.  Measles is a highly contagious respiratory infection caused by a virus. It causes a total-body skin rash and flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough, and runny nose. According to information posted on WHO's website, the virus is highly contagious, spreading by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact, and direct contact with infected nasal or throat secretions. Unvaccinated young children pose the highest risk of measles and its complications, including death.  The Romanian Government adopted earlier this month August 2017 a draft bill on the organization and financing of population vaccination (https://www.romania-insider.com/romania-draft-bill-vaccination/). The project was sent to the Parliament for approval and could come into force in January 2018.  byline: Irina Marica   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Measles tends to be more severe in children who are malnourished, especially children who are also vitamin A deficient. And complications are commoner and more serious in malnourished children. Because of complications such as diarrhoea, measles may lead to failure to thrive. Infection with measles virus may lead to kwashiorkor or marasmus in children who are underweight at the time that they get infected. Therefore, measles may result in, or aggravate, malnutrition.

Date: Sat 26 Aug 2017. Source: News-Medical/Life Sciences (edited) (https://www.news-medical.net/news/20170826/New-study-highlights-role-played-by-demographics-in-the-spread-of-measles.aspx)   Even if the incidence of measles infection has decreased by at least 90 per cent worldwide since the introduction of the vaccine, measles is still one of the major causes of death in children among vaccine-preventable diseases. Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world.  A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries.  Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years.  \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\"  \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea\".  The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years 2 million DALYs since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln 13 million DALYs in the US, and 36-mln 36 million DALYs in Ethiopia.  \"Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,\" continues Prof Melegaro \"our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population. Tailoring immunization campaigns to achieve measles eradication goals is essential and currently, for some countries, this means considering also the role of unprotected adolescents and young adults.\"   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Reference - Trentini F, Poletti P, Merler S, Melegaro A.

The total amount of dead wild boars discovered in the woods around\nZlín, in the far east of the Czech Republic, stood at 94 at the end\nof August 2017. In this month, 23 new infected carcasses were found,\nwhich is a downward trend from July 2017, when 68 reports were sent\nto the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). The 1st report of\nASF in Czech wild boars was on Wed 21 Jun 2017. Many neighbouring countries have alerted their local pig producers to\nbe very careful what to feed their pigs - and their inhabitants what\nto purchase and how to dispose of it. So did Slovakia, according to\nthe Slovak Spectator. Zlín is only a few km away from the western\nSlovak border, to its north is Poland where ASF has been around since\n2014 and on its eastern border is Ukraine, where ASF has been\nconfirmed since 2011. In a presentation, given in mid-July 2017 to the European\nCommission's Standing Committee On Animals, Plants, Food and Feed\n(SCoPAFF), Dr Petr Šatrán of the Czech State Veterinary\nAdministration indicated that human activities are most likely the\ncause of the spread of the virus, seeing that the nearest reported\ncases of ASF were roughly 500 km 310.68 mi away and that the\npositive dead wild boars were found in inhabited areas. In the other country where ASF was found for the 1st time in 2017,\nRomania, things appear relatively quiet. News broke early this month\nAugust 2017 that ASF was also found on 2 backyard farms in the north\nof the country. Ever since, the Romanian authorities did not report\nany further outbreaks of ASF to the OIE. Of all other countries in the European Union, especially Poland has\ncontinued to report outbreaks of African Swine Fever in smaller and\nmiddle-sized operations. In August alone, on 23 farm sites of various\nsizes, ASF was found to have infected at least one animal, after which\nthe entire herd would have to be culled. The biggest operation in this respect was a farm near Monki, Podlaskie\nprovince, where all remaining 431 pigs had to be culled after 11 had\ndied as a result of ASF, on Sat 19 Aug 2017. Noteworthy as well was\nthe ASF-related closure of 2 farms in Lack, Lubelskie province, in\nearly August. These farms had 136 and 141 pigs respectively see also\nitem 2.

For a full\nexplanation, see European Commission Implementing Decision\n2014/708/EU. ASF, a viral disease against which no vaccine has become available so\nfar, is currently threatening central and western Europe, where dense\npopulations of wild boar are present. According to a recent update of DEFRA (UK) ASF situation assessment,\nthe continuing cases in the Czech Republic, the spread in Poland which\nappears to be due to several breakdowns in biosecurity and the new\noutbreaks in Romania are \"concerning\". This signifies a spread in\ngeographic distribution, a possible drop in biosecurity awareness and\ntherefore an increase in the weight of infection in East Europe. Despite the relatively low level of trade in live pigs, there could be\na substantial movement of people, vehicles and personal imports of\npork products, therefore the risk of ASF introduction to the UK has\nbeen raised from \"very low\" (that is, \"rare but could occur\") to\n\"low\". The Russian veterinary watchdog Rosselkhoznadzor believes ASF will\nkeep moving west via 2 main pathways. The southerly route, has already\nseen the virus spread from Ukraine to Moldova. Russian vets believe it\ncould penetrate central Romania, then move to the Balkans, including\nBulgaria and Serbia. On the northern route, now that ASF has been found in the Czech\nRepublic, Rosselkhoznadzor believes, if it gains a foothold, it is\nlikely to head further west, with Germany next in the firing line.

This came about after 2\nkidney recipients in Taiwan were diagnosed with dengue 2 days after\nreceiving a kidney each from the same donor, said National Cheng Kung\nUniversity microbiology and immunology professor Dr Oscar Perng\nGuey-chuen. \"This indicates a potential risk,\" the Taiwan-based\nscientist said, adding that no dengue virus was detected in the\ndonor's blood. He said the donor contracted dengue in 2015 and in mid-2016, he died\nin an accident. His family donated his corneas, liver, heart, and\nkidneys. Both patients had the same strain of the dengue virus the\ndonor had in 2015 and one of the recipients died of dengue\nhaemorrhagic fever, he said. Asked where the virus could be hiding since it could not be detected\nin the blood, he said it was a question scientists are trying to\nanswer. Interestingly, those who received the donor's corneas, liver,\nand heart did not develop dengue, Dr Perng said on the sidelines of\nthe National Dengue And Arboviruses Infection Conference 2017\nyesterday 12 Aug 2017. He said although there was not enough\nevidence to show the virus came from the donor as the kidneys were not\ntested for dengue before the transplant, the same virus was found in\nthe patients' bodies after that. Dr Perng said his team had studied mice for dengue virus in the blood\ntestes, kidney, liver, spleen and brain, and found the virus present\nin the kidneys and brain. \"We believe the virus probably resided in\nthe kidneys and was not cleared by the body,\" he said, adding that the\nvirus could have been activated after transplant. He said this raised\nconcerns about asymptomatic people who are dengue carriers. Health Ministry deputy director, general Datuk Dr S Jeyaindran said\npatients with severe dengue would have better recovery if they were\ngiven colloids, a more concentrated fluid, at the early stage in fluid\nmanagement for dengue patients. Dr Jeyaindran, who was representing\nHealth Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam, said colloids may be\nintroduced at an earlier stage, instead of saline because it has not\nbeen successful in treating patients with severe dengue. He said more\nstudies will be conducted to find out at which stage the colloids\nshould be given. byline: Loh Foon Fong \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) - Air travel related spread of dengue.\nDate: Thu 3 Aug 2017.\nSource: Medical Xpress (edited)\n(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-08-air-responsible-dengue-asia.html) \nWhile the incidences of many other infectious diseases have declined\nover the past decade, the number of cases and outbreaks of dengue\nvirus have continued to increase. The spread of dengue to new areas is\nlikely due in large part to trends in air travel, researchers now\nreport in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Dengue virus affects as estimated 390 million people around the globe\neach year, and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild fever and\nheadache to severe low blood pressure. The virus has mostly caused\ndisease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, but a 2014\noutbreak in Japan broke that pattern. Overall, the geographic area\naffected by dengue has been growing in recent years. In the new work, Huaiyu Tian and Bing Xu, both of Beijing Normal\nUniversity, China, together with colleagues from the University of\nOxford and elsewhere analyzed the spread of dengue viruses in Asia\nfrom 1956 to 2015. They used 2202 genetic sequences of dengue viruses,\ncollected in 20 countries or regions of Asia over the 59 years, to\ndetermine how different strains were related. They also investigated\ntrends in air travel, maritime mobility, migration, and\nsocio-economics to determine what factors impact the spread of\ndengue. The spread of 3 different dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1, -2, and -3,\nis associated with air traffic more so than any other factors, the\ndata revealed. Air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India, the\nresearchers found, help seed dengue epidemics, while China, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, and Singapore help diffuse the virus to other Asian\ncountries. \"Future trends in global mobility could potentially accelerate the\nappearance and diffusion of DENV worldwide,\" the researchers say.\n\"Prevention and control of dengue epidemics requires a better\nunderstanding of its mode of geographic dissemination, especially for\ncountries in the tropics.\" Reference: Tian H, Sun Z, Faria NR, et al.

Among the 26 newly reported cases, 13 are associated with a cluster in\na hospital in Al Jawf Region, Saudi Arabia. The initial case was a\n51-year-old reported on Wed 2 Aug 2017. To date, 12 cases have been\nidentified through contact tracing. These cases include 8 health care\nworkers (all asymptomatic) in the hospital where the initial case was\ntreated, one hospital contact (a 70-year-old male) and 3 household\ncontacts. Follow up of health care workers, hospital and household\ncontacts are ongoing. Globally, 2066 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV\nincluding at least 720 related deaths have been reported to WHO. Public health response\nThe Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia evaluates each case and their\ncontacts and implements measures to limit further human-to-human\ntransmission and bring Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)\noutbreaks under control. The measures taken by Ministry of Health\nofficials in Saudi Arabia include:  - Risk stratification and active tracing for contacts in healthcare\nand in communities. High risk contacts (e.g. unprotected exposure to a\ncase or engagement in an aerosol generating procedure) are tested by\nPCR regardless of having symptoms. Health care workers are exempted\nfrom work until they are cleared by infection control experts. - Trained hospital epidemiologists have been deployed to sites within\n24 hours of identifying an outbreak. - Enforcement of strict adherence to environmental disinfection and\nterminal cleaning of affected areas. - Enforcement of visual triage for respiratory diseases in emergency\ndepartment and outpatient departments and ensuring the 24/7\navailability of trained nurses for early detection of patients with\nrespiratory symptoms, and proper documentation on triage forms. - Extensive training of all health care workers on case definition\nfor early detection, implementation of isolation precautions, proper\nselection, donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE),\nhand hygiene and environmental cleaning and disinfection. - Ensuring availability of infection prevention supplies including\nhand sanitizer, PPEs, surface disinfectants, portable HEPA filters and\nfumigation machines. - Ensuring that all health care workers are fit tested for high\nefficiency respirators. - Implementing the policy of not allowing health care personnel\nworking in a facility affected by an outbreak to travel or work in\nHajj premises or in any healthcare facility until they are medical\ncleared. WHO risk assessment\nMERS-CoV causes severe human infections resulting in high mortality\nand has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far,\nthe observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred\nmainly in health care settings. The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk\nassessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection\nwill be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to\nbe exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the\ninfection after exposure to animals or animal products (for example,\nfollowing contact with dromedaries) or human source (for example, in a\nhealth care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological\nsituation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available\ninformation. WHO advice\nBased on the current situation and available information, WHO\nencourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute\nrespiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the\npossible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not\nalways possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like\nother respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are\nnon-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply\nstandard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of\ntheir diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard\nprecautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute\nrespiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should\nbe added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV\ninfection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing\naerosol generating procedures. Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal\nfailure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are\nconsidered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV\ninfection. Therefore, in addition to avoiding close contact with\nsuspected or confirmed human cases of the disease, people with these\nconditions should avoid close contact with animals, particularly\ncamels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is\nknown to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as\nregular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding\ncontact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid\ndrinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not\nbeen properly cooked. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard\nto this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any\ntravel or trade restrictions. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp In summary, according to the WHO update, as of Sat 12 Aug 2017,\nthere have been a total of 2066 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV\ninfection reported to WHO, including at least 720 related deaths\n(reported case fatality rate 34.8 percent). In the period covered by\nthe above update (4 Jul - 12 Aug 2017), there were 26 newly confirmed\nlaboratory confirmed infections with the MERS-CoV including 8\nasymptomatic infections associated with the outbreak in Dawmet\nAljandal (Asir region). In addition to the 6 fatalities among these 26 newly confirmed\ninfections, official recovery reports from the MOH were available for\ncases no. 1 (on Tue 11 Jul 2017), no. 3 (on Mon 31 Jul 2017), no 5 (on\nThu 17 Aug 2017), and no. 9 (Tue 15 Aug 2017). Classifications of the 26 cases reported by the MOH included:\nA total of 8 primary cases with high risk exposures still under\ninvestigation (cases nos. 1, 2, 3, 7, 11, 20, 21, and 26)\nOne primary case with no known high risk exposure (case no. 6)\nUp to 4 primary cases with contact with camels (3 direct contact, one\nindirect contact  cases nos. 4, 5, 8 and 12)\nA total of 8 secondary healthcare associated cases in healthcare\nworkers (cases nos. 10, 15, 16, 17, 22, 23, 24, and 25)\nOne secondary healthcare associated case in a patient (case no.19)\nUp to 4 secondary cases in household contacts (cases nos. 9, 13, 14\nand 18) According to the WHO update, case no. 11 had a history of contact with\ncamels that was not known at the time of the MOH report. Interpretation of the details above is that outside of the outbreak in\nAsir region, the pattern of transmission was primarily sporadic cases,\naround the country, the majority of whom were classified as primary\ncases with unidentified high risk exposures (8 out of 13) and the\nremaining 5 cases had a history of known contact with camels and camel\nproducts in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. So the question\nremains, what is the high risk exposure that is not being identified?\n....- Mod.MPP ","keywordsMatched":[]},"129":{"title":"MERS-CoV (56): UAE, Saudi Arabia (JF, HA, RI),\r\n\tWHO ","date":["29","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH/EDR> MERS-CoV (56): UAE, Saudi Arabia (JF, HA, RI),\r\n\tWHO [EXTERNAL]","summary":"\nMERS-COV (56): UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, SAUDI ARABIA (AL JAWF, HAIL,\nRIYADH), WHO\n\nA ProMED-mail post\n(http://www.promedmail.org)\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n(http://www.isid.org) In this update:\n<br><br><strong>{1}</strong> UAE, 1 new case - WHO\n<br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Saudi Arabia, 7 new cases - Saudi MOH 19-29 Aug 2017 \n<br><br><strong>{1}</strong> UAE, 1 new case - WHO.\nDate: Mon 28 Aug 2017.\nSource: WHO Emergencies preparedness, response, Disease Outbreak News\n(DONs) (edited)\n(http://www.who.int/csr/don/28-august-2017-mers-uae/en/) \nMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - United Arab\nEmirates\n\nOn 29 Jul 2017, the national IHR focal point of the United Arab\nEmirates reported one additional case of Middle East Respiratory\nSyndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) Details of the case\n-\nMERS-CoV case reported on 29 July 2017*\nPlease note, data corresponds to Disease Outbreak News as published on\n28 Aug 2017.\n* Data subject to change due to ongoing investigations.

On 25 Jul 2017, his symptoms worsened and\na sputum sample was collected and tested for MERS-CoV and influenza.\nOn 26 Jul 2017, showing no signs of improvement, the patient was\ntransferred to a 2nd hospital in Al Ain and placed in an intensive\ncare unit. A 2nd sputum sample was collected on 26 Jul 2017 and both samples\ntested positive for MERS-CoV on 27 Jul 2017. The patient is\ncurrently in ICU on mechanical ventilation. Investigations into the\nsource of infection are ongoing. At the time of writing the results of\nthe investigation were not yet provided to WHO. Globally, 2067 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV\nincluding at least 720 related deaths have been reported to WHO. Public health response\n-\nThe Ministry of Health in Abu Dhabi carried out contact tracing and\nfollowed up 89 health care workers and 95 contacts at his place of\nemployment. All identified contacts were monitored for 14 days from\nthe last date of exposure. No additional cases were detected. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp I have been unable to find additional information on both official\nsources as well as unofficial sources of information related to the\ncase described in the UAE in the above WHO report.

Information\non results of contact tracing continuing until 14 days following last\nknown contact with the case (one incubation period) was available for\nall contacts. Hence, this is a nice historical archive of\nidentification of a sporadic case of MERS-CoV infection, although the\ninformation on the investigation of possible high risk exposures of\nthe actual case is not available at present. This is now the 5th case of MERS-CoV infection identified in the UAE\nthis year, with 2 previous cases in May 2017 from Al Ain, and 2\nadditional previous cases from Abu Dhabi reported in April 2017,\nbringing the total number of cases reported by the UAE since 2012 up\nto 84.

Clearly\ntransmission is continuing in this area, with 3 newly confirmed\nsecondary cases in household contacts - at least 2 of whom were\nidentified through screening of asymptomatic household contacts, and 2\nadditional cases in which high risk exposures are still under\ninvestigation. We do not know if these household contacts are\nassociated with the earlier identified transmission chain in Dawmat\nAljandal or if these are newly identified chains of transmission. The\nother 2 newly confirmed cases involve \"sporadic\" cases - an individual\nin Hail whose high risk exposure history is still under investigation,\nand an individual from Alaflaj (Riyadh region) with a history of\ndirect contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. As to be expected, concern is being voiced on the international level\nwith the upcoming Hajj and this recent increase in cases reported both\nin Saudi Arabia and in the UAE. We now have gone through 5 Hajj\nperiods since the identification of the MERS-CoV and to date there\nhave been no cases of MERS-CoV infection identified in returning\nHajjis. The case in the UAE (see section <br><br><strong>{1}</strong> above) actually had onset\nof illness over 1 month ago with no secondary cases/infections\nidentified among known contacts of this case. As for the cases in\nSaudi Arabia, and more specifically the Hajj, population movement is\nvery well defined during the Hajj, no camels are permitted in the\nareas where Hajjis are congregated, and there are Hajj specific health\nservices that are separate from those that are available for the\ngeneral Saudi population, all factors that are reducing the likelihood\nof Hajjis having inadvertent (or intentional) high risk exposures.\nHopefully my optimism is well placed and we will pass through a 6th\nHajj period without impact on international transmission of the\nMERS-CoV associated with this Hajj.

Update: Interim guidance\nfor health care providers caring for pregnant women with possible Zika\nvirus exposure  United States (including US Territories), July 2017.\nMMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2017; 66(29): 781-93. doi:\n10.15585/mmwr.mm6629e1\n-\nCDC has updated the interim guidance for US health care providers\ncaring for pregnant women with possible Zika virus exposure in\nresponse to 1) declining prevalence of Zika virus disease in the World\nHealth Organization's Region of the Americas (Americas) and 2)\nemerging evidence indicating prolonged detection of Zika virus\nimmunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies. Zika virus cases were 1st reported\nin the Americas during 2015-2016; however, the incidence of Zika virus\ndisease has since declined. As the prevalence of Zika virus disease\ndeclines, the likelihood of false-positive test results increases. In\naddition, emerging epidemiologic and laboratory data indicate that, as\nis the case with other flaviviruses, Zika virus IgM antibodies can\npersist beyond 12 weeks after infection. Therefore, IgM test results\ncannot always reliably distinguish between an infection that occurred\nduring the current pregnancy and one that occurred before the current\npregnancy, particularly for women with possible Zika virus exposure\nbefore the current pregnancy. These limitations should be considered\nwhen counseling pregnant women about the risks and benefits of testing\nfor Zika virus infection during pregnancy. This updated guidance\nemphasizes a shared decision-making model for testing and screening\npregnant women, one in which patients and providers work together to\nmake decisions about testing and care plans based on patient\npreferences and values, clinical judgment, and a balanced assessment\nof risks and expected outcomes. For these recommendations, the definition of possible Zika virus\nexposure has not changed and includes travel to, or residence in an\narea with risk for mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission or sex with\na partner who has traveled to or resides in an area with risk for\nmosquito-borne Zika virus transmission. These areas can be found on\nthe CDC \"Zika Travel Information\" webpage. Key recommendations include the following:\n1- All pregnant women in the United States and US territories should\nbe asked about possible Zika virus exposure before and during the\ncurrent pregnancy, at every prenatal care visit. CDC recommends that\npregnant women not travel to any area with risk for Zika virus\ntransmission. It is also recommended that pregnant women with a sex\npartner who has traveled to or lives in an area with risk for Zika\nvirus transmission use condoms or abstain from sex for the duration of\nthe pregnancy.\n2- Pregnant women with recent possible Zika virus exposure and\nsymptoms of Zika virus disease should be tested to diagnose the cause\nof their symptoms. The updated recommendations include concurrent Zika\nvirus nucleic acid test (NAT) and serologic testing as soon as\npossible through 12 weeks after symptom onset.\n3- Asymptomatic pregnant women with ongoing possible Zika virus\nexposure should be offered Zika virus NAT testing 3 times during\npregnancy. IgM testing is no longer routinely recommended because IgM\ncan persist for months after infection; therefore, IgM results cannot\nreliably determine whether an infection occurred during the current\npregnancy. The optimal timing and frequency of testing of asymptomatic\npregnant women with NAT alone is unknown. For pregnant women who have\nreceived a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection (by\neither NAT or serology positive/equivocal Zika virus or dengue virus\nIgM and Zika virus plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) 10 and\nhigher and dengue virus PRNT less than 10 results) any time before or\nduring the current pregnancy, additional Zika virus testing is not\nrecommended. For pregnant women without a prior laboratory-confirmed\ndiagnosis of Zika virus, NAT testing should be offered at the\ninitiation of prenatal care, and if Zika virus RNA is not detected on\nclinical specimens, 2 additional tests should be offered during the\ncourse of the pregnancy coinciding with prenatal visits.\n4- Asymptomatic pregnant women who have recent possible Zika virus\nexposure (that is, through travel or sexual exposure) but without\nongoing possible exposure are not routinely recommended to have Zika\nvirus testing. Testing should be considered using a shared\npatient-provider decision-making model, one in which patients and\nproviders work together to make decisions about testing and care plans\nbased on patient preferences and values, clinical judgment, a balanced\nassessment of risks and expected outcomes, and the jurisdiction's\nrecommendations. Based on the epidemiology of Zika virus transmission\nand other epidemiologic considerations (such as, seasonality),\njurisdictions might recommend testing of asymptomatic pregnant women,\neither for clinical care or as part of Zika virus surveillance. With\nthe decline in the prevalence of Zika virus disease, the updated\nrecommendations for the evaluation and testing of pregnant women with\nrecent possible Zika virus exposure but without ongoing possible\nexposure are now the same for all areas with any risk for Zika virus\ntransmission.\n5- Pregnant women who have recent possible Zika virus exposure and who\nhave a fetus with prenatal ultrasound findings consistent with\ncongenital Zika virus syndrome should receive Zika virus testing to\nassist in establishing the etiology of the birth defects. Testing\nshould include both NAT and IgM tests.\n6- The comprehensive approach to testing placental and fetal tissues\nhas been updated. Testing placental and fetal tissue specimens can be\nperformed for diagnostic purposes in certain scenarios (e.g., women\nwithout a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection and\nwho have a fetus or infant with possible Zika virus-associated birth\ndefects). However, testing of placental tissues for Zika virus\ninfection is not routinely recommended for asymptomatic pregnant women\nwho have recent possible Zika virus exposure but without ongoing\npossible exposure and who have a live born infant without evidence of\npossible Zika virus-associated birth defects.\n7- Zika virus IgM testing as part of preconception counseling to\nestablish baseline IgM results for non pregnant women with ongoing\npossible Zika virus exposure is not warranted because Zika virus IgM\ntesting is no longer routinely recommended for asymptomatic pregnant\nwomen with ongoing possible Zika virus exposure. also at the source URL above:\nAdditional interim guidance:\n- Laboratory testing of pregnant women with exposure to areas with\nrisk for Zika virus transmission\n- Prenatal management of pregnant women with laboratory evidence of\npossible Zika virus infection\n- Evaluation of placental and fetal tissue specimens for Zika virus\ninfection \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org)\nand\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be)(promed@promedmail.org) Readers interested in accessing the full report can find it at the\nsource URL above.

To evaluate the rates of acute ZIKV infection among\npatients hospitalized with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS),\nmeningoencephalitis, or transverse myelitis.\nDesign, setting, and participants. A prospective, observational cohort\nstudy was conducted at a tertiary referral center for neurological\ndiseases in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between 5 Dec 2015-10 May 2016,\namong consecutive hospitalized adults (older than 18 years of age)\nwith new-onset acute parainfectious or neuroinflammatory disease. All\nparticipants were tested for a series of arbovirosis. 3-month\nfunctional outcome was assessed.\nInterventions. Samples of serum and cerebrospinal fluid were tested\nfor ZIKV using real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain\nreaction and an IgM antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent\nassay. Clinical, radiographic (magnetic resonance imaging),\nelectrophysiological, and 3-month functional outcome data were\ncollected.\nMain outcomes and measures. The detection of neurologic complications\nsecondary to ZIKV infection.\nResults. 40 patients (15 women and 25 men; median age, 44 years\nrange, 22-72 years) were enrolled, including 29 patients (73\npercent) with GBS (90 percent Brighton level 1 certainty), 7 (18\npercent) with encephalitis, 3 (8 percent) with transverse myelitis,\nand 1 (3 percent) with newly diagnosed chronic inflammatory\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy. Of these, 35 patients (88 percent) had\nmolecular and/or serologic evidence of recent ZIKV infection in the\nserum and/or cerebrospinal fluid. Of the patients positive for ZIKV\ninfection, 27 had GBS (18 demyelinating, 8 axonal, and 1 Miller Fisher\nsyndrome), 5 had encephalitis (3 with concomitant acute neuromuscular\ndisease), 2 had transverse myelitis, and 1 had chronic inflammatory\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy. Admission to the intensive care unit was\nrequired for 9 patients positive for ZIKV infection (26 percent), and\n5 (14 percent) required mechanical ventilation. Compared with\nadmission during the period from 5 Dec 2013 - 10 May 2014 (before the\nBrazilian outbreak of ZIKV), admissions for GBS increased from a mean\nof 1.0 per month to 5.6 per month, admissions for encephalitis\nincreased from 0.4 per month to 1.4 per month, and admissions for\ntransverse myelitis remained constant at 0.6 per month. At 3 months, 2\npatients positive for ZIKV infection (6 percent) died (1 with GBS and\n1 with encephalitis), 18 (51 percent) had chronic pain, and the median\nmodified Rankin score among survivors was 2 (range, 0-5).\nConclusions and relevance. In this single-center Brazilian cohort,\nZIKV infection was associated with an increase in the incidence of a\ndiverse spectrum of serious neurologic syndromes. The data also\nsuggest that serologic and molecular testing using blood and\ncerebrospinal fluid samples can serve as a less expensive, alternative\ndiagnostic strategy in developing countries, where plaque reduction\nneutralization testing is impractical. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) This study illustrates the need to consider post-Zika virus infection\nas a cause of a variety of neurological diseases.

PLoS\nPathog. 2017; 13(8): e1006487. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006487\n-\nAbstract\n\nStudies have demonstrated cross-reactivity of anti-dengue virus (DENV)\nantibodies in human sera against Zika virus (ZIKV), promoting\nincreased ZIKV infection in vitro. However, the correlation between in\nvitro and in vivo findings is not well characterized. Thus, we\nevaluated the impact of heterotypic flavivirus immunity on ZIKV titers\nin biofluids of rhesus macaques. Animals previously infected (420 days\nor longer) with DENV2, DENV4, or yellow fever virus were compared to\nflavivirus-naïve animals following infection with a Brazilian ZIKV\nstrain. Sera from DENV-immune macaques demonstrated cross-reactivity\nwith ZIKV by antibody-binding and neutralization assays prior to ZIKV\ninfection, and promoted increased ZIKV infection in cell culture\nassays. Despite these findings, no significant differences between\nflavivirus-naïve and immune animals were observed in viral titers,\nneutralizing antibody levels, or immune cell kinetics following ZIKV\ninfection. These results indicate that prior infection with\nheterologous flaviviruses neither conferred protection nor increased\nobserved ZIKV titers in this non-human primate ZIKV infection model. Author summary\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne, emerging flavivirus. In\naddition to asymptomatic or mild febrile manifestations, ZIKV\ninfection in humans is associated with comparatively rare congenital\nand neurological abnormalities. Previous in vitro studies have\ndemonstrated cross-reactivity of antibodies derived from dengue virus\ninfections with ZIKV, as well as antibody-mediated enhancement of\ninfection in cell culture. Therefore, there is concern among\nvaccinologists and the public health community that the more severe\ndisease manifestations could result from prior immunity, either from\nnatural infection or vaccination, to antigenically-related\nflaviviruses (such as, dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis).\nIn this study, we evaluated the impact of prior immunity to dengue or\nyellow fever virus on ZIKV infection in a non-human primate model.\nAfter confirming that our immune cohorts were capable of\nrecapitulating the published in vitro observations of cross-reactivity\nand enhancement, we looked for alteration of viral titers in\nperipheral blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, and vaginal\nsecretions, as well as alterations in gross pathology, clinical\nparameters, and immune response, as compared to our flavivirus-naïve\ncohort. Importantly, no significant differences between\nflavivirus-naïve and primed animals were observed in viral titers or\nbiofluid distribution, neutralizing antibody levels, or immune cell\nkinetics following ZIKV infection. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org)\nand\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be)(promed@promedmail.org) Previous dengue infection, whether acquired naturally or antibody\nelicited by vaccines, has been a concern due to the possibility of\nantibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) with more severe disease. This\nconcern also relates to Zika virus antibody from vaccination for\nenhancement of dengue virus infections with resulting more severe\ndisease. The monkey studies reported above indicated that this may not\nbe a problem for Zika virus vaccinated individuals.

ZIKV is also transmitted by\nsexual contact, although the relative importance of sexual\ntransmission is unclear. To better understand the role of sexual\ntransmission in ZIKV pathogenesis, a nonhuman primate (NHP) model of\nvaginal transmission was developed. ZIKV was readily transmitted to\nmature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by vaginal inoculation was\nreadily transmitted to mature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by\nvaginal individual RM with 1-5 vaginal inoculations required to\nestablish infection. After treatment with Depoprovera, a widely used\ncontraceptive progestin, 2 RM that initially resisted 8 vaginal ZIKV\ninoculations became infected after one ZIKV inoculation. Thus,\nDepoprovera seemed to enhance susceptibility to vaginal ZIKV\ntransmission. Unexpectedly, the kinetics of virus replication and\ndissemination after intravaginal ZIKV inoculation were markedly\ndifferent from RM infected with ZIKV by subcutaneous (SQ) virus\ninoculation. Several groups have reported that after SQ ZIKV\ninoculation vRNA is rapidly detected in blood plasma with vRNA less\ncommon in urine and saliva and only rarely detected in female\nreproductive tract (FRT) secretions. In contrast, in vaginally\ninoculated RM, plasma vRNA is delayed for several days and ZIKV\nreplication in, and vRNA shedding from, the FRT was found in all 6\nanimals. Further, after intravaginal transmission ZIKV RNA shedding\nfrom FRT secretions was detected before or simultaneously with plasma\nvRNA, and persisted for at least as long. Thus, ZIKV replication in\nthe FRT was independent of, and often preceded virus replication in\nthe tissues contributing to plasma vRNA. These results support the\nconclusion that ZIKV preferentially replicates in the FRT after\nvaginal transmission, but not after SQ transmission, and raise the\npossibility that there is enhanced fetal infection and pathology after\nvaginal ZIKV transmission compared to a mosquito transmitted ZIKV. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{10}</strong> _Aedes albopictus_ populations as vectors.\nDate: 2 Aug 2017.\nSource: American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (edited)\n(http://www.ajtmh.org/content/journals/10.4269/ajtmh.16-0969) \nref: Azar SR, Roundy CM, Rossi SL, et al.

Positive saliva samples were assayed for\ninfectious titer. Although all 3 mosquito populations were susceptible\nto all ZIKV strains, rates of infection, dissemination, and\ntransmission differed among mosquito and virus strains. _Aedes\nalbopictus_ from Salvador, Brazil, were the least efficient vectors,\ndemonstrating susceptibility to infection to 2 American strains of\nZIKV but failing to shed virus in saliva. Mosquitoes from the Rio\nGrande Valley were the most efficient vectors and were capable of\nshedding all 3 tested ZIKV strains into saliva after 14 days of\nextrinsic incubation. In particular, ZIKV strain DakAR 41525 (Senegal\n1954) was significantly more efficient at dissemination and saliva\ndeposition than the others tested in Rio Grande mosquitoes. Overall,\nour data indicate that, while _Ae. albopictus_ is capable of\ntransmitting ZIKV, its competence is potentially dependent on\ngeographic origin of both the mosquito population and the viral\nstrain. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) This study illustrates that fact that not all Zika virus strains and\n_Ae. albopictus_ populations are created equal in terms of efficiency\nof transmission of this virus. Although some populations of this\nmosquito are able to efficiently transmits some Zika viruses, the fact\nthat _Ae. albopictus _ are not strictly human biters, further reduces\ntheir role as transmitters of this virus to people. - Mod.TY \n<br><br><strong>{11}</strong> _Culex quinquefasciatus_ as vectors.\nDate: Wed 9 Aug 2017.\nSource: Emerging Microbes & Infections (edited)\n(http://www.nature.com/emi/journal/v6/n8/full/emi201759a.html?foxtrotcallback=true) \nref: Guedes DR, Paiva MH, Donato MM, et al.

Emerg Microbes\nInfect. 2017; 6(8): e69. doi: 10.1038/emi.2017.59\n-\nAbstract\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has recently been associated\nwith an increased incidence of neonatal microcephaly and other\nneurological disorders. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito\nbite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some\ncases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main\nvector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other\nmosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the\nvirus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit\nZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of\nlaboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_.\nInterestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the\nmidgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in\nRecife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially\nfed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced.\nCollectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range\nof ZIKV vectors than anticipated. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be) Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active\nvirus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their\nability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step\ntoward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_\nfed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in\nsaliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing.\nThe study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a\ncompetent vector. Several other studies have shown this species to be\ninefficient vectors or refractory to Zika virus infection. One wonders\nif the specific _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ used or the Zika virus isolates\nwith which they were tested could account for these very different\nresults. Resolving these discrepancies is important because this\nmosquito species is very widely distributed around the world and bears\ndirectly on risk of outbreaks in geographic areas where _Aedes\naegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_ , Zika virus vectors, do not occur. -\nMod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Republic of Serbia":{},"Seychelles":{},"Sierra Leone":{"119":{"title":"Ebola update (36): news, research ","date":["23","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH/EDR> Ebola update (36): news, research [EXTERNAL]","summary":" A ProMED-mail post (http://www.promedmail.org) ProMED-mail is a program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases (http://www.isid.org)  In this update: <br><br><strong>{1}</strong> News - Disability rate in survivors - Ebola cemetery vandalism <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Research - Viremia and organ damage   <br><br><strong>{1}</strong> News - Disability rate in survivors 21 Aug 2017. Study finds high disability rate in Ebola survivors (http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2017/08/study-finds-high-disability-rate-ebola-survivors) Ebola survivors have 7 times the disability rate of their close contacts, and the virus likely causes muscle damage. The findings are among data from 2 new studies published in Clinical Infectious Diseases that observe survivors of Sierra Leone's Ebola outbreak to understand how often the disease causes disabilities and how it affects major organs. Though both studies are small, they provide new insight into the lasting damage that Ebola virus disease (EVD) causes survivors.  Ebola and long-lasting disabilities (1)  In the 1st study, researchers followed 27 Ebola survivors in Sierra Leone for 1 year after diagnosis and found they were 7 times more likely than their close contacts to report a disability. 77.8 percent of the survivors reported a disability 1 year post-infection, compared with 11.1 percent of their close contacts. Disabilities included major limitations in vision, mobility, and cognition. Disability was measured using the Washington group disability questionnaire, and the survivors were matched with 54 unaffected contacts. Mobility difficulties were the most frequent disability reported, with almost all survivors reporting musculoskeletal pain. \"This study has demonstrated that a year following acute disease, survivors of the recent EVD outbreak have higher odds of persisting disability in mobility, vision, and cognition,\" the authors concluded. \"Mental health issues such as anxiety and depression persist in EVD survivors and must not be neglected.\"  Ebola virus causes muscle damage (2)  In the other study based on EVD survivors in Sierra Leone, researchers looked at the relationship between Ebola viremia and specific organ damage. They found no evidence that Ebola virus specifically damages the liver or kidney, but they did find strong evidence to suggest that the virus destroys muscles and the body's coagulation system. This is the 1st study to compare Ebola viremia to specific biomarkers, the authors said. To conduct the study, data on biomarkers from 49 survivors and 51 non-survivors were collected and analyzed. 10 biomarkers, including bilirubin, creatinine, and Ebola viremia were used to determine which organ systems were under attack during an Ebola infection. While it has long been assumed that Ebola, a hemorrhagic fever, causes damage to the coagulation system, little else is known about how the virus attacks organs. Though the study provided no evidence that Ebola affected the kidneys, kidney damage is often seen in Ebola patients. The authors said this was because Ebola viremia was strongly related to evidence of rhabdomyolysis, the rapid breakdown of muscles, which stresses the kidneys.

Sierra Leone: Crooks dig up Sierra Leone's 'Ebola Cemetery'. Thieves pillage the tombs of the rich and the poor, desecrating their bodies, erasing their identities. (http://www.thedailybeast.com/crooks-dig-up-sierra-leones-ebola-cemetery) After a devastating mudslide hit Freetown, Sierra Leone, early last week week of 14 Aug 2017, the nation held a painful ceremony to bury the dead. The government hired about 600 gravediggers, while a huge crowd that included President Ernest Bai Koroma and his Liberian counterpart, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, looked on. Hundreds were interred in a new cemetery, a recent creation for people whose death arrived all of a sudden. But few there are allowed to rest in peace. This particular graveyard in Waterloo, about 15 miles 24 km east of the capital Freetown, is known in Sierra Leone as the \"Ebola cemetery.\" It was used to inter 4000 victims of the 2014-15 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak. But after the disease was contained, the cemetery was made available to the public for burial  and hoodlums saw an opportunity. During the EVD epidemic Waterloo was managed by the nongovernmental organization out of Ireland, Concern Worldwide, but since the charity handed it over to the Western Area Rural District Council, thieves have been on a rampage. They reportedly have stolen a giant tank that stores water for the cemetery's buildings, carted away zinc sheets in the toilet facility, and vandalized the pavilion that was built for visitors to sit.

We used concomitant determination of routine laboratory biomarkers and Ebola viremia to explore the potential role of viral replication in specific organ damage. Conclusion. This study provides evidence to support that Ebola virus may have a direct role in muscular damage and imbalance of the coagulation system. We did not found strong evidence suggestive of a direct role of Ebola virus in kidney damage. The role of the virus in liver damage remains unclear, but our evidence suggests that acute severe liver injury is not a typical feature of Ebola virus disease.  See source URL for full report.

Update: Interim guidance\nfor health care providers caring for pregnant women with possible Zika\nvirus exposure  United States (including US Territories), July 2017.\nMMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2017; 66(29): 781-93. doi:\n10.15585/mmwr.mm6629e1\n-\nCDC has updated the interim guidance for US health care providers\ncaring for pregnant women with possible Zika virus exposure in\nresponse to 1) declining prevalence of Zika virus disease in the World\nHealth Organization's Region of the Americas (Americas) and 2)\nemerging evidence indicating prolonged detection of Zika virus\nimmunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies. Zika virus cases were 1st reported\nin the Americas during 2015-2016; however, the incidence of Zika virus\ndisease has since declined. As the prevalence of Zika virus disease\ndeclines, the likelihood of false-positive test results increases. In\naddition, emerging epidemiologic and laboratory data indicate that, as\nis the case with other flaviviruses, Zika virus IgM antibodies can\npersist beyond 12 weeks after infection. Therefore, IgM test results\ncannot always reliably distinguish between an infection that occurred\nduring the current pregnancy and one that occurred before the current\npregnancy, particularly for women with possible Zika virus exposure\nbefore the current pregnancy. These limitations should be considered\nwhen counseling pregnant women about the risks and benefits of testing\nfor Zika virus infection during pregnancy. This updated guidance\nemphasizes a shared decision-making model for testing and screening\npregnant women, one in which patients and providers work together to\nmake decisions about testing and care plans based on patient\npreferences and values, clinical judgment, and a balanced assessment\nof risks and expected outcomes. For these recommendations, the definition of possible Zika virus\nexposure has not changed and includes travel to, or residence in an\narea with risk for mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission or sex with\na partner who has traveled to or resides in an area with risk for\nmosquito-borne Zika virus transmission. These areas can be found on\nthe CDC \"Zika Travel Information\" webpage. Key recommendations include the following:\n1- All pregnant women in the United States and US territories should\nbe asked about possible Zika virus exposure before and during the\ncurrent pregnancy, at every prenatal care visit. CDC recommends that\npregnant women not travel to any area with risk for Zika virus\ntransmission. It is also recommended that pregnant women with a sex\npartner who has traveled to or lives in an area with risk for Zika\nvirus transmission use condoms or abstain from sex for the duration of\nthe pregnancy.\n2- Pregnant women with recent possible Zika virus exposure and\nsymptoms of Zika virus disease should be tested to diagnose the cause\nof their symptoms. The updated recommendations include concurrent Zika\nvirus nucleic acid test (NAT) and serologic testing as soon as\npossible through 12 weeks after symptom onset.\n3- Asymptomatic pregnant women with ongoing possible Zika virus\nexposure should be offered Zika virus NAT testing 3 times during\npregnancy. IgM testing is no longer routinely recommended because IgM\ncan persist for months after infection; therefore, IgM results cannot\nreliably determine whether an infection occurred during the current\npregnancy. The optimal timing and frequency of testing of asymptomatic\npregnant women with NAT alone is unknown. For pregnant women who have\nreceived a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection (by\neither NAT or serology positive/equivocal Zika virus or dengue virus\nIgM and Zika virus plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) 10 and\nhigher and dengue virus PRNT less than 10 results) any time before or\nduring the current pregnancy, additional Zika virus testing is not\nrecommended. For pregnant women without a prior laboratory-confirmed\ndiagnosis of Zika virus, NAT testing should be offered at the\ninitiation of prenatal care, and if Zika virus RNA is not detected on\nclinical specimens, 2 additional tests should be offered during the\ncourse of the pregnancy coinciding with prenatal visits.\n4- Asymptomatic pregnant women who have recent possible Zika virus\nexposure (that is, through travel or sexual exposure) but without\nongoing possible exposure are not routinely recommended to have Zika\nvirus testing. Testing should be considered using a shared\npatient-provider decision-making model, one in which patients and\nproviders work together to make decisions about testing and care plans\nbased on patient preferences and values, clinical judgment, a balanced\nassessment of risks and expected outcomes, and the jurisdiction's\nrecommendations. Based on the epidemiology of Zika virus transmission\nand other epidemiologic considerations (such as, seasonality),\njurisdictions might recommend testing of asymptomatic pregnant women,\neither for clinical care or as part of Zika virus surveillance. With\nthe decline in the prevalence of Zika virus disease, the updated\nrecommendations for the evaluation and testing of pregnant women with\nrecent possible Zika virus exposure but without ongoing possible\nexposure are now the same for all areas with any risk for Zika virus\ntransmission.\n5- Pregnant women who have recent possible Zika virus exposure and who\nhave a fetus with prenatal ultrasound findings consistent with\ncongenital Zika virus syndrome should receive Zika virus testing to\nassist in establishing the etiology of the birth defects. Testing\nshould include both NAT and IgM tests.\n6- The comprehensive approach to testing placental and fetal tissues\nhas been updated. Testing placental and fetal tissue specimens can be\nperformed for diagnostic purposes in certain scenarios (e.g., women\nwithout a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection and\nwho have a fetus or infant with possible Zika virus-associated birth\ndefects). However, testing of placental tissues for Zika virus\ninfection is not routinely recommended for asymptomatic pregnant women\nwho have recent possible Zika virus exposure but without ongoing\npossible exposure and who have a live born infant without evidence of\npossible Zika virus-associated birth defects.\n7- Zika virus IgM testing as part of preconception counseling to\nestablish baseline IgM results for non pregnant women with ongoing\npossible Zika virus exposure is not warranted because Zika virus IgM\ntesting is no longer routinely recommended for asymptomatic pregnant\nwomen with ongoing possible Zika virus exposure. also at the source URL above:\nAdditional interim guidance:\n- Laboratory testing of pregnant women with exposure to areas with\nrisk for Zika virus transmission\n- Prenatal management of pregnant women with laboratory evidence of\npossible Zika virus infection\n- Evaluation of placental and fetal tissue specimens for Zika virus\ninfection \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org)\nand\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be)(promed@promedmail.org) Readers interested in accessing the full report can find it at the\nsource URL above.

To evaluate the rates of acute ZIKV infection among\npatients hospitalized with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS),\nmeningoencephalitis, or transverse myelitis.\nDesign, setting, and participants. A prospective, observational cohort\nstudy was conducted at a tertiary referral center for neurological\ndiseases in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between 5 Dec 2015-10 May 2016,\namong consecutive hospitalized adults (older than 18 years of age)\nwith new-onset acute parainfectious or neuroinflammatory disease. All\nparticipants were tested for a series of arbovirosis. 3-month\nfunctional outcome was assessed.\nInterventions. Samples of serum and cerebrospinal fluid were tested\nfor ZIKV using real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain\nreaction and an IgM antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent\nassay. Clinical, radiographic (magnetic resonance imaging),\nelectrophysiological, and 3-month functional outcome data were\ncollected.\nMain outcomes and measures. The detection of neurologic complications\nsecondary to ZIKV infection.\nResults. 40 patients (15 women and 25 men; median age, 44 years\nrange, 22-72 years) were enrolled, including 29 patients (73\npercent) with GBS (90 percent Brighton level 1 certainty), 7 (18\npercent) with encephalitis, 3 (8 percent) with transverse myelitis,\nand 1 (3 percent) with newly diagnosed chronic inflammatory\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy. Of these, 35 patients (88 percent) had\nmolecular and/or serologic evidence of recent ZIKV infection in the\nserum and/or cerebrospinal fluid. Of the patients positive for ZIKV\ninfection, 27 had GBS (18 demyelinating, 8 axonal, and 1 Miller Fisher\nsyndrome), 5 had encephalitis (3 with concomitant acute neuromuscular\ndisease), 2 had transverse myelitis, and 1 had chronic inflammatory\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy. Admission to the intensive care unit was\nrequired for 9 patients positive for ZIKV infection (26 percent), and\n5 (14 percent) required mechanical ventilation. Compared with\nadmission during the period from 5 Dec 2013 - 10 May 2014 (before the\nBrazilian outbreak of ZIKV), admissions for GBS increased from a mean\nof 1.0 per month to 5.6 per month, admissions for encephalitis\nincreased from 0.4 per month to 1.4 per month, and admissions for\ntransverse myelitis remained constant at 0.6 per month. At 3 months, 2\npatients positive for ZIKV infection (6 percent) died (1 with GBS and\n1 with encephalitis), 18 (51 percent) had chronic pain, and the median\nmodified Rankin score among survivors was 2 (range, 0-5).\nConclusions and relevance. In this single-center Brazilian cohort,\nZIKV infection was associated with an increase in the incidence of a\ndiverse spectrum of serious neurologic syndromes. The data also\nsuggest that serologic and molecular testing using blood and\ncerebrospinal fluid samples can serve as a less expensive, alternative\ndiagnostic strategy in developing countries, where plaque reduction\nneutralization testing is impractical. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) This study illustrates the need to consider post-Zika virus infection\nas a cause of a variety of neurological diseases.

We found that ZIKV\npersistently infects brain endothelial cells that normally protect\nneurons from viral exposure. hBMECs are not damaged by ZIKV infection\nand, analogous to persistent HCV infection, ZIKV constitutively\ninduces and evades antiviral ISG IFN-stimulated genes and IFN\ninterferon responses to continuously replicate in hBMECs.

Consistent with the spread of ZIKV into neuronal\ncompartments, ZIKV was released basolaterally from hBMECs.

PLoS\nPathog. 2017; 13(8): e1006487. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006487\n-\nAbstract\n\nStudies have demonstrated cross-reactivity of anti-dengue virus (DENV)\nantibodies in human sera against Zika virus (ZIKV), promoting\nincreased ZIKV infection in vitro. However, the correlation between in\nvitro and in vivo findings is not well characterized. Thus, we\nevaluated the impact of heterotypic flavivirus immunity on ZIKV titers\nin biofluids of rhesus macaques. Animals previously infected (420 days\nor longer) with DENV2, DENV4, or yellow fever virus were compared to\nflavivirus-naïve animals following infection with a Brazilian ZIKV\nstrain. Sera from DENV-immune macaques demonstrated cross-reactivity\nwith ZIKV by antibody-binding and neutralization assays prior to ZIKV\ninfection, and promoted increased ZIKV infection in cell culture\nassays. Despite these findings, no significant differences between\nflavivirus-naïve and immune animals were observed in viral titers,\nneutralizing antibody levels, or immune cell kinetics following ZIKV\ninfection. These results indicate that prior infection with\nheterologous flaviviruses neither conferred protection nor increased\nobserved ZIKV titers in this non-human primate ZIKV infection model. Author summary\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne, emerging flavivirus. In\naddition to asymptomatic or mild febrile manifestations, ZIKV\ninfection in humans is associated with comparatively rare congenital\nand neurological abnormalities. Previous in vitro studies have\ndemonstrated cross-reactivity of antibodies derived from dengue virus\ninfections with ZIKV, as well as antibody-mediated enhancement of\ninfection in cell culture. Therefore, there is concern among\nvaccinologists and the public health community that the more severe\ndisease manifestations could result from prior immunity, either from\nnatural infection or vaccination, to antigenically-related\nflaviviruses (such as, dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis).\nIn this study, we evaluated the impact of prior immunity to dengue or\nyellow fever virus on ZIKV infection in a non-human primate model.\nAfter confirming that our immune cohorts were capable of\nrecapitulating the published in vitro observations of cross-reactivity\nand enhancement, we looked for alteration of viral titers in\nperipheral blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, and vaginal\nsecretions, as well as alterations in gross pathology, clinical\nparameters, and immune response, as compared to our flavivirus-naïve\ncohort. Importantly, no significant differences between\nflavivirus-naïve and primed animals were observed in viral titers or\nbiofluid distribution, neutralizing antibody levels, or immune cell\nkinetics following ZIKV infection. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org)\nand\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be)(promed@promedmail.org) Previous dengue infection, whether acquired naturally or antibody\nelicited by vaccines, has been a concern due to the possibility of\nantibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) with more severe disease. This\nconcern also relates to Zika virus antibody from vaccination for\nenhancement of dengue virus infections with resulting more severe\ndisease. The monkey studies reported above indicated that this may not\nbe a problem for Zika virus vaccinated individuals. Another effort to\navoid ADE is development of a vaccine that has epitopes specific for\nZika virus that are not shared by other flaviviruses.

ZIKV is also transmitted by\nsexual contact, although the relative importance of sexual\ntransmission is unclear. To better understand the role of sexual\ntransmission in ZIKV pathogenesis, a nonhuman primate (NHP) model of\nvaginal transmission was developed. ZIKV was readily transmitted to\nmature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by vaginal inoculation was\nreadily transmitted to mature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by\nvaginal individual RM with 1-5 vaginal inoculations required to\nestablish infection. After treatment with Depoprovera, a widely used\ncontraceptive progestin, 2 RM that initially resisted 8 vaginal ZIKV\ninoculations became infected after one ZIKV inoculation. Thus,\nDepoprovera seemed to enhance susceptibility to vaginal ZIKV\ntransmission. Unexpectedly, the kinetics of virus replication and\ndissemination after intravaginal ZIKV inoculation were markedly\ndifferent from RM infected with ZIKV by subcutaneous (SQ) virus\ninoculation. Several groups have reported that after SQ ZIKV\ninoculation vRNA is rapidly detected in blood plasma with vRNA less\ncommon in urine and saliva and only rarely detected in female\nreproductive tract (FRT) secretions. In contrast, in vaginally\ninoculated RM, plasma vRNA is delayed for several days and ZIKV\nreplication in, and vRNA shedding from, the FRT was found in all 6\nanimals. Further, after intravaginal transmission ZIKV RNA shedding\nfrom FRT secretions was detected before or simultaneously with plasma\nvRNA, and persisted for at least as long. Thus, ZIKV replication in\nthe FRT was independent of, and often preceded virus replication in\nthe tissues contributing to plasma vRNA. These results support the\nconclusion that ZIKV preferentially replicates in the FRT after\nvaginal transmission, but not after SQ transmission, and raise the\npossibility that there is enhanced fetal infection and pathology after\nvaginal ZIKV transmission compared to a mosquito transmitted ZIKV. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{10}</strong> _Aedes albopictus_ populations as vectors.\nDate: 2 Aug 2017.\nSource: American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (edited)\n(http://www.ajtmh.org/content/journals/10.4269/ajtmh.16-0969) \nref: Azar SR, Roundy CM, Rossi SL, et al.

Positive saliva samples were assayed for\ninfectious titer. Although all 3 mosquito populations were susceptible\nto all ZIKV strains, rates of infection, dissemination, and\ntransmission differed among mosquito and virus strains. _Aedes\nalbopictus_ from Salvador, Brazil, were the least efficient vectors,\ndemonstrating susceptibility to infection to 2 American strains of\nZIKV but failing to shed virus in saliva. Mosquitoes from the Rio\nGrande Valley were the most efficient vectors and were capable of\nshedding all 3 tested ZIKV strains into saliva after 14 days of\nextrinsic incubation. In particular, ZIKV strain DakAR 41525 (Senegal\n1954) was significantly more efficient at dissemination and saliva\ndeposition than the others tested in Rio Grande mosquitoes. Overall,\nour data indicate that, while _Ae. albopictus_ is capable of\ntransmitting ZIKV, its competence is potentially dependent on\ngeographic origin of both the mosquito population and the viral\nstrain. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) This study illustrates that fact that not all Zika virus strains and\n_Ae. albopictus_ populations are created equal in terms of efficiency\nof transmission of this virus.

Emerg Microbes\nInfect. 2017; 6(8): e69. doi: 10.1038/emi.2017.59\n-\nAbstract\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has recently been associated\nwith an increased incidence of neonatal microcephaly and other\nneurological disorders. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito\nbite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some\ncases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main\nvector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other\nmosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the\nvirus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit\nZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of\nlaboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_.\nInterestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the\nmidgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in\nRecife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially\nfed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced.\nCollectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range\nof ZIKV vectors than anticipated. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be) Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active\nvirus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their\nability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step\ntoward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_\nfed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in\nsaliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing.\nThe study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a\ncompetent vector. Several other studies have shown this species to be\ninefficient vectors or refractory to Zika virus infection. One wonders\nif the specific _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ used or the Zika virus isolates\nwith which they were tested could account for these very different\nresults. Resolving these discrepancies is important because this\nmosquito species is very widely distributed around the world and bears\ndirectly on risk of outbreaks in geographic areas where _Aedes\naegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_ , Zika virus vectors, do not occur. -\nMod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"114":{"title":"Measles update (43): Asia and Pacific, Europe, demographics\r\n\t","date":["26","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Measles update (43): Asia and Pacific, Europe, demographics\r\n\t[EXTERNAL]","summary":" A ProMED-mail post (http://www.promedmail.org) ProMED-mail is a program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases (http://www.isid.org)  In this update: Asia and Pacific  <br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Japan: travel alert <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Australia (Perth, Western Australia): ex Italy  Europe  <br><br><strong>{3}</strong> Germany (Berlin): 2014-15 <br><br><strong>{4}</strong> Romania  Measles immunity gaps  <br><br><strong>{5}</strong> Role of demographics   Asia and Pacific  <br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Japan: travel alert.

The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare is advising tourists to go to hospital if they develop a high fever or generalized rash after returning to Japan.  Although the World Health Organization verified that Japan has eliminated infections of endemic measles strains in 2015, group infections originating from people who contracted the disease abroad are spreading in the country. As of 6 Aug 2017, the number of patients reached 169 this year in Japan, already eclipsing the figure in the previous year.  About 4100 patients in Italy and around 6500 patients in Romania have already been confirmed as of August 2017 compared with about 860 and 2000, respectively, throughout 2016, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.  Symptoms of the highly contagious disease include runny nose, red and watery eyes, high fever, and rash. The virus is spread through coughing and sneezing and can cause complications such as pneumonia and can even result in death in one in 1000 patients, according to the ministry. The ministry recommends people traveling overseas to check their vaccination records and take an additional shot if they have only been vaccinated once.  The disease was prevalent about a decade ago in Japan with the number of patients soaring to over 10 000 in 2008 but the country was later considered as free from infections of the virus.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Japan can be found at (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/156). - Mod.LK   <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Australia (Perth, Western Australia): ex Italy.

Large measles outbreak introduced by asylum seekers and spread among the insufficiently vaccinated resident population, Berlin, October 2014 to August 2015. Euro Surveill. 2017; 22(34): pii=30599 - Abstract  The largest measles outbreak in Berlin since 2001 occurred from October 2014 to August 2015. Overall, 1344 cases were ascertained, 86 per cent (with available information) unvaccinated, including 146 (12 per cent) asylum seekers. Median age was 17 years (interquartile range: 4-29 years), 26 per cent were hospitalised and a 1 year old child died. Measles virus genotyping uniformly revealed the variant 'D8-Rostov-Don' and descendants. The virus was likely introduced by and initially spread among asylum seekers before affecting Berlin's resident population. Among Berlin residents, the highest incidence was in children younger than 2 years, yet most cases (52 per cent) were adults. Post-exposure vaccinations in homes for asylum seekers, not always conducted, occurred later (median: 7.5 days) than the recommended 72 hours after onset of the 1st case and reached only half of potential contacts. Asylum seekers should not only have non-discriminatory, equitable access to vaccination, they also need to be offered measles vaccination in a timely fashion, that is, immediately upon arrival in the receiving country. Supplementary immunisation activities targeting the resident population, particularly adults, are urgently needed in Berlin.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail.

Source: Romania Insider (edited) (https://www.romania-insider.com/measles-kills-iraqi-refugee/)   The ongoing measles outbreak keeps making victims in Romania. A 10 month old girl, who was a refugee from Iraq, became the 33rd person to die of the infection, reports local Digi24. The girl arrived in Romania on 7 Jul 2017 with her family, and the doctors diagnosed her with measles in August. They also discovered that the child was suffering from malnutrition and severe psychomotor retardation.  The measles outbreak is still a major problem in Romania, with more than 8900 cases reported across the country until 25 Aug 2017, including 33 deaths, according to data from the National Center for Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases (CNSCBT). Most deaths were registered in Timis (9), Dolj (7), and Arad (6) counties.  Measles is a highly contagious respiratory infection caused by a virus. It causes a total-body skin rash and flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough, and runny nose. According to information posted on WHO's website, the virus is highly contagious, spreading by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact, and direct contact with infected nasal or throat secretions. Unvaccinated young children pose the highest risk of measles and its complications, including death.  The Romanian Government adopted earlier this month August 2017 a draft bill on the organization and financing of population vaccination (https://www.romania-insider.com/romania-draft-bill-vaccination/). The project was sent to the Parliament for approval and could come into force in January 2018.  byline: Irina Marica   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Measles tends to be more severe in children who are malnourished, especially children who are also vitamin A deficient. And complications are commoner and more serious in malnourished children. Because of complications such as diarrhoea, measles may lead to failure to thrive. Infection with measles virus may lead to kwashiorkor or marasmus in children who are underweight at the time that they get infected. Therefore, measles may result in, or aggravate, malnutrition.

Date: Sat 26 Aug 2017. Source: News-Medical/Life Sciences (edited) (https://www.news-medical.net/news/20170826/New-study-highlights-role-played-by-demographics-in-the-spread-of-measles.aspx)   Even if the incidence of measles infection has decreased by at least 90 per cent worldwide since the introduction of the vaccine, measles is still one of the major causes of death in children among vaccine-preventable diseases. Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world.  A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries.  Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years.  \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\"  \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea\".  The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years 2 million DALYs since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln 13 million DALYs in the US, and 36-mln 36 million DALYs in Ethiopia.  \"Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,\" continues Prof Melegaro \"our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population. Tailoring immunization campaigns to achieve measles eradication goals is essential and currently, for some countries, this means considering also the role of unprotected adolescents and young adults.\"   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Reference - Trentini F, Poletti P, Merler S, Melegaro A.

All 4 dengue serotypes are\npresent this year 2017. A total of 15 samples found to be\nco-infected. In an earlier study done in New Delhi, such multiple\ndengue serotype infections were reported in only 19 per cent of cases.\nAll 4 dengue serotypes were detected in almost equal number in blood\nsamples, unlike in an earlier study conducted in New Delhi wherein one\nserotype was found to be dominating. This has been indicated as a\npossible reason for the high prevalence of infection due to more than\none dengue serotype. Another finding of concern is that DEN-4 strain,\nresembling the one detected in Pune in 2009, was detected in as many\nas 11 samples. DEN-4 is associated with unusual symptoms like\nrespiratory distress, pleural effusion, and elevated levels of liver\nenzymes. Also, detection of a DEN-1 strain found closely related to a\nstrain from Thailand detected in 1980 that causes high severity\ninfection has been reported.

This came about after 2\nkidney recipients in Taiwan were diagnosed with dengue 2 days after\nreceiving a kidney each from the same donor, said National Cheng Kung\nUniversity microbiology and immunology professor Dr Oscar Perng\nGuey-chuen. \"This indicates a potential risk,\" the Taiwan-based\nscientist said, adding that no dengue virus was detected in the\ndonor's blood. He said the donor contracted dengue in 2015 and in mid-2016, he died\nin an accident. His family donated his corneas, liver, heart, and\nkidneys. Both patients had the same strain of the dengue virus the\ndonor had in 2015 and one of the recipients died of dengue\nhaemorrhagic fever, he said. Asked where the virus could be hiding since it could not be detected\nin the blood, he said it was a question scientists are trying to\nanswer. Interestingly, those who received the donor's corneas, liver,\nand heart did not develop dengue, Dr Perng said on the sidelines of\nthe National Dengue And Arboviruses Infection Conference 2017\nyesterday 12 Aug 2017. He said although there was not enough\nevidence to show the virus came from the donor as the kidneys were not\ntested for dengue before the transplant, the same virus was found in\nthe patients' bodies after that. Dr Perng said his team had studied mice for dengue virus in the blood\ntestes, kidney, liver, spleen and brain, and found the virus present\nin the kidneys and brain. \"We believe the virus probably resided in\nthe kidneys and was not cleared by the body,\" he said, adding that the\nvirus could have been activated after transplant. He said this raised\nconcerns about asymptomatic people who are dengue carriers. Health Ministry deputy director, general Datuk Dr S Jeyaindran said\npatients with severe dengue would have better recovery if they were\ngiven colloids, a more concentrated fluid, at the early stage in fluid\nmanagement for dengue patients. Dr Jeyaindran, who was representing\nHealth Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam, said colloids may be\nintroduced at an earlier stage, instead of saline because it has not\nbeen successful in treating patients with severe dengue. He said more\nstudies will be conducted to find out at which stage the colloids\nshould be given. byline: Loh Foon Fong \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) - Air travel related spread of dengue.\nDate: Thu 3 Aug 2017.\nSource: Medical Xpress (edited)\n(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-08-air-responsible-dengue-asia.html) \nWhile the incidences of many other infectious diseases have declined\nover the past decade, the number of cases and outbreaks of dengue\nvirus have continued to increase. The spread of dengue to new areas is\nlikely due in large part to trends in air travel, researchers now\nreport in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Dengue virus affects as estimated 390 million people around the globe\neach year, and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild fever and\nheadache to severe low blood pressure. The virus has mostly caused\ndisease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, but a 2014\noutbreak in Japan broke that pattern. Overall, the geographic area\naffected by dengue has been growing in recent years. In the new work, Huaiyu Tian and Bing Xu, both of Beijing Normal\nUniversity, China, together with colleagues from the University of\nOxford and elsewhere analyzed the spread of dengue viruses in Asia\nfrom 1956 to 2015. They used 2202 genetic sequences of dengue viruses,\ncollected in 20 countries or regions of Asia over the 59 years, to\ndetermine how different strains were related. They also investigated\ntrends in air travel, maritime mobility, migration, and\nsocio-economics to determine what factors impact the spread of\ndengue. The spread of 3 different dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1, -2, and -3,\nis associated with air traffic more so than any other factors, the\ndata revealed. Air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India, the\nresearchers found, help seed dengue epidemics, while China, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, and Singapore help diffuse the virus to other Asian\ncountries. \"Future trends in global mobility could potentially accelerate the\nappearance and diffusion of DENV worldwide,\" the researchers say.\n\"Prevention and control of dengue epidemics requires a better\nunderstanding of its mode of geographic dissemination, especially for\ncountries in the tropics.\" Reference: Tian H, Sun Z, Faria NR, et al.

Five districts in 3 governorates are now infected.  The total number of cVDPV2 cases is 33 (this includes the previously reported 29 cases from Mayadeen district, Deir ez-Zor governorate, and 1 case from Tell Abyad district, Raqqa governorate). All confirmed cases to date have had onset of paralysis before 11 Jul 2017.  Final lab results for an additional 9 poliovirus type-2 (PV2) isolates from Deir ez-Zor are pending.  Discussions around expanding the scope of the immunization response to include accessible areas of a Tadmour sub-district in Homs, bordering Deir ez-Zor , will be held in light of the confirmation of the cases in this area.  Raqqa governorate commenced its 1st immunization round on 12 Aug 2017 (Raqqa and Thawra districts) and 13 Aug 2017 (Tell Abyad district). The immunization round aims to reach 120 000 children under 5 years of age. Preliminary information suggests the rounds are reaching children in all 3 districts.  Preparations continue for the 2nd round in Deir ez-Zor governorate, scheduled for 19-23 Aug 2017. IPV inactivated polio vaccine for use in the 2nd rounds in Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa governorates has arrived in Damascus.  The total number of AFP acute flaccid paralysis cases detected in Deir ez-Zor governorate since the beginning of 2017 is 113 (83 from Mayadeen, 11 from Deir ez-Zor, and 19 from Boukamal districts). Raqqa governorate has reported 16 AFP cases (5 from Raqqa, 10 from Tell Abyad, and 1 from Thawra districts). Homs governorate has reported 26 AFP cases (11 from Homs city, 12 from Rastan, 1 from Tadmour, and 2 from Talkalakh districts).  The Eradication and Outbreak Management Group (EOMG) has approved the release of additional doses of IPV to cover high risk population groups in northwest Syria, Turkey, and Lebanon. Lebanon requested 144 000 doses and has begun to implement IPV campaigns across the country.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Unfortunately transmission of the cVDPV2 in Syria has continued. With each report, the date of onset of the most recent case shifts to a date approximately one month preceding the report, probably reflecting the time it takes from specimen collection to appropriate reference laboratory. We are fairly sure there will be an additional 9 cases confirmed from Deir ez-Zor, as the report above mentions that there are 9 poliovirus isolates pending typing (WPV vs cVDPV). The report also mentions a significant number of AFP cases identified in the 3 governorates, suggesting there may be more cases in the pipeline for confirmation. The control activities have been implemented during this week and will be implemented in additional areas next week week of 21 Aug 2017, so hopefully there will be interruption of transmission going forward.  The disturbing news in the situation report above, is that there is now involvement of 3 governorates. Deir ez-Zor, Raqqa, and now Homs. On a map of Syria showing provinces/governorates ((http://www.freeworldmaps.net/asia/syria/syria-political-map.jpg)), one can see that Deir ez-Zor, the main governorate involved in this outbreak is located in the northeast of the country sharing it's eastern border with Iraq. It shares a southern border with Homs, and a western border with Raqqa (Ar-Raqqah on this map) governorate. Hopefully the cVDPV2 will not continue to travel in the country outside of the currently 3 affected areas. - Mod.MPP   <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Somalia: declared polio free. Date: Mon 14 Aug 2017. Source: AllAfrica, Shabelle Media Network (Mogadishu) report (edited) (http://allafrica.com/stories/201708150227.html)   The UN World Health Organisation (WHO) said it had not recorded any case of polio disease in Somalia in the last 3 years, declaring the country polio free.  The WHO said the country recorded the last case of polio in 2014 in the central part of the country but has since then remained free of the paralyzing disease.  The UN health agency, however, warned Somalia remained vulnerable, calling for continued vaccination campaign, Xinhua News Agency reported.  The head of the WHO Eastern Mediterranean, which covers Somalia, Mohamed Fiqi said that massive vaccination campaigns and commitment from government and international actors had ensured the polio virus did not recur in the Horn of Africa country.  \"As the world edges closer to eradicating polio, keeping alert in countries that have high risk of polio importation like Somalia is more of priority than ever,\" Fiqi said.  \"As we move forward, the polio programme in Somalia needs to continue to work to maintain and improve the level of population immunity against polio through target vaccination campaign and strengthening of the routine immunisation services and infrastructure,\" Fiqi added.  The declaration by WHO keeps Somalia outside the last group of countries which still record cases of polio in the world.  Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan are the remaining countries where polio is still being recorded. The WHO chief warned Somalia remains at risk of importation of the virus from these countries.  Somalia President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo praised efforts to rid his country of the polio disease which he noted had subjected many children into suffering.  \"No cases were found for the past 3 years and no child was affected by this disease. Many of our children have suffered from polio for many years.  \"To eradicate polio was a big success and it was collective effort and commitment by many young men and women who sacrificed their lives,\" Farmaajo noted.  The 3 year polio-free celebration comes amidst the worst outbreak of measles the country has seen in years.  Somalia is also still responding to an outbreak of acute watery diarrhoea/cholera, which began in January 2017. Polio systems and networks are being used in both interventions.  \"Polio infrastructure has been critical in responding to these other serious outbreaks,\" said Fiqi.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  Achieving 3 years with no new cases of polio reported is a significant achievement for Somalia. That being said, it's important to remember that this too is a country with internal civil strife and warring factions, which may impede the identification of poliovirus associated disease either due to infrastructural challenges in good specimen collection and transport, or access of the population to the healthcare infrastructure. A reminder is the identification of WPV associated cases in Borno, Nigeria last year (2016), involving a virus last seen 5 years before in the same state.

We continue to work together to advance shared priorities, including governance and democracy, regional security, poverty reduction, polio eradication, trade, defense, and the fight against climate change.\"  - The 14th Emergency Committee for polio eradication under the International Health Regulations met on 3 Aug 2017 and has made its recommendations to the WHO Director-General, who has accepted them. The Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and recommended the extension of revised Temporary Recommendations for a further 3 months. The key change is the inclusion of DR Congo and Syria in the category 'States infected with cVDPV2s, with potential risk of international spread'.  - Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: Afghanistan: 1 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case; Pakistan: 1 new WPV1-positive environmental sample; Syrian Arab Republic: 3 new circulating vaccine-derived polio type 2 (cVDPV2) from Syria, 2 from Deir ez-Zor and 1 from Homs governorates. Details in country-specific sections below.  Afghanistan  - One new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week, bringing the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 to 6. It is the most recent case in the country, and had onset of paralysis on 10 Jul 2017, from Zabul province, neighbouring Kandahar province and Pakistan. - Afghanistan continues to coordinate activities with neighbouring Pakistan, to address both cross-border transmission and focus on reaching mobile populations with oral polio vaccine (OPV). Transmission linking both countries runs primarily across 3 corridors, namely: eastern Afghanistan and Khyber-Peshawar, Pakistan; greater Kandahar/Helmand and Quetta, Pakistan; and, Paktika/Patkya/Khost and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa/Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Pakistan.  Pakistan  - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week; the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 3. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 11 Jun 2017, from Killa Abdullah, Balochistan. - 1 new WPV1-positive environmental sample was reported in the past week, collected on 28 Jul 2017, from Quetta, Balochistan. - A special vaccination round is being implemented during August 2017 targeting areas with recent polio cases and positive environmental samples. These include Rawalpindi/Islamabad and demographically connected areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Quetta Block, and parts of Karachi. - Under the National Emergency Action Plan for polio eradication, the country is planning to implement 2 nation-wide and 2 sub-national vaccination rounds from September to December 2017.  Nigeria - - No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 21 Aug 2016 in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno. - Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016). - Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance.  Lake Chad Basin  - The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno, Nigeria in 2016) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) (Borno and Sokoto provinces in Nigeria in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak. - Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.  Central Africa  - No new cases of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). The total number of cVDPV2 cases this year 2017 remains 7, in 2 separate outbreaks: in Haut Lomami province (5 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on 13 Jun 2017); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on 26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017, with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May 2017). - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time. Outbreak response is taking place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols, targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 across the 2 provinces. - The 1st mOPV2 round was implemented on 27-29 Jun 2017 in the 2 affected provinces; and the 2nd mOPV2 round ran from 13-15 Jul 2017 in Haut Lomami and 20-22 Jul 2017 in Maniema. - Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.  Middle East  - In Syria, 3 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were officially reported in the past week. The total number of cases in this outbreak is 33. Onset of paralysis of these cases is between 3 Mar 2017 and 10 Jul 2017. 31 of the cases are from Deir ez-Zor governorate (29 from Mayadeen district, one from Deir ez-Zor district, and one from Boukamal district); 1 case is from Talabyad district, Raqqa governorate; and, 1 is from Tadmour district in Homs governorate. - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized and implemented, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Two vaccination campaigns are planned for both Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa governorates. If there is geographic spread, the extent of these campaigns will have to be adjusted. - The 1st mOPV2 round in Deir ez-Zor was successfully carried out between 22-26 Jul 2017. Independent post-campaign monitoring reflected coverage of 88.4 percent (based on caregiver recall). The 2nd round is planned for 19-23 Aug 2017, and will include mOPV2 and IPV. - Raqqa Governorate started mOPV2 campaigns on 12 Aug 2017. - Plans are being finalized to mitigate the risks of further spread from the outbreak zone to neighbouring areas and countries, including immunization of at-risk populations in northwest Syria, Turkey and Lebanon. Following confirmation of the case in Homs, discussions are ongoing to further extend the geographic reach of the outbreak response.

(promed@promedmail.org)  This week's global update is similar to prior weeks in terms of low level identification of WPV1 associated disease (a single case confirmed in Afghanistan this past week), one positive WPV1 isolated from an environmental sample in Pakistan, and 3 newly confirmed cVDPV2 associated cases in Syria.  That being said, there have only been 9 confirmed cases of WPV1 associated paralytic disease worldwide this year (2017), compared with 37 cases reported last year (2016). In contrast there have been 40 confirmed cases of cVDPV2 confirmed this year (2017) compared with 5 last year (2016). As a reminder, outbreaks due to cVDPV's are considered as significant in the big picture of polio eradication, as they are due to vaccine polioviruses that have reverted in neurovirulence following passage through multiple individuals while circulating in the susceptible population. The goal of the polio eradication initiative is to interrupt transmission of both the WPV's and the cVDPVs.

NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in\npress): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons,\nvaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside\nof Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as\n60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection\nlengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:\n- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam;\n- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis.

Professor Lucille Blumberg with the NICD said it was likely the\ninfected children did not receive all their vaccines. Diphtheria is a dangerous respiratory disease that is caused by a\npotent toxin produced by certain strains of the bacterium\n_Corynebacterium diphtheriae_. Diphtheria is extremely contagious\nthrough coughing or sneezing. Risk factors include crowding, poor\nhygiene, and lack of immunization. Symptoms usually appear within a\nweek of infection. This infection is characterized by a sore throat,\ncoughing, and fever very similar to many common diseases like strep\nthroat. Additional symptoms may be bloody, watery discharge from the\nnose and rapid breathing. However, a presumptive diagnosis can be made\nby observing a characteristic thick grayish patch (membrane) found in\nthe throat. In more severe cases, neck swelling, and airway\nobstruction may be observed. In the tropics, cutaneous and wound\ndiphtheria is much more common and can be a source of transmission. The real serious danger is when the toxin that is produced by the\nbacterium gets into the bloodstream and spreads to organs like the\nheart and nervous system. Myocarditis, congestive heart failure, and\nneurological illnesses of paralysis that mimic Guillain-Barré\nsyndrome are most severe. Even with treatment, fatalities are still\nseen in up to 10 percent of cases. Diphtheria can be treated and cured successfully with antitoxin and\nantimicrobials if started early enough.

It was previously\nconsidered to be one of the most dreaded diseases, with frequent\nlarge-scale outbreaks in the New England colonies between 1735 and\n1740. It was said that the disease killed as many as 80 per cent of\nthe children below 10 years of age. Diphtheria is otherwise called the\n\"Strangling Angel of Children\" and was a dreaded common childhood\nillness. Statistics show that in the 1920s, there were an estimated\n100 000 to 200 000 cases of diphtheria per year in the USA, with 13\n000 to 15 000 deaths.\" The following was extracted from\n(http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/dip.pdf):\n\"_C. diphtheriae_ is an aerobic Gram-positive bacillus. Toxin\nproduction (toxigenicity) occurs only when the bacillus is itself\ninfected (lysogenized) by a specific virus (bacteriophage) carrying\nthe genetic information for the toxin (tox gene). Only toxigenic\nstrains can cause severe disease. Culture of the organism requires\nselective media containing tellurite. If isolated, the organism must\nbe distinguished in the laboratory from other _Corynebacterium_\nspecies that normally inhabit the nasopharynx and skin (such as\ndiphtheroids). _C. diphtheriae_ has 4 biotypes: gravis, intermedius,\nmitis and belfanti. The most severe disease is associated with the\ngravis biotype, but any strain may produce toxin. All isolates of _C.\ndiphtheriae_ should be tested by the laboratory for toxigenicity. \"Susceptible persons may acquire toxigenic diphtheria bacilli in the\nnasopharynx. The organism produces a toxin that inhibits cellular\nprotein synthesis and is responsible for local tissue destruction and\nmembrane formation. The toxin produced at the site of the membrane is\nabsorbed into the bloodstream and then distributed to the tissues of\nthe body. The toxin is responsible for the major complications of\nmyocarditis and neuritis and can also cause low platelet counts\n(thrombocytopenia) and protein in the urine (proteinuria). Clinical\ndisease associated with non-toxin-producing strains is generally\nmilder. While rare severe cases have been reported, these may actually\nhave been caused by toxigenic strains that were not detected because\nof inadequate culture sampling. \"The incubation period of diphtheria is 2-5 days (range, 1-10 days).\nDisease can involve almost any mucous membrane. For clinical purposes,\nit is convenient to classify diphtheria into a number of\nmanifestations, depending on the site of disease. The most common\nsites of diphtheria infection are the pharynx and the tonsils.\nInfection at these sites is usually associated with substantial\nsystemic absorption of toxin. The onset of pharyngitis is insidious.\nEarly symptoms include malaise, sore throat, anorexia, and low-grade\nfever. Within 2-3 days, a bluish-white membrane forms and extends,\nvarying in size from covering a small patch on the tonsils to covering\nmost of the soft palate. Often by the time a physician is contacted,\nthe membrane is greyish-green, or black if bleeding has occurred.\nThere is a minimal amount of mucosal erythema surrounding the\nmembrane. The membrane is adherent to the tissue, and forcible\nattempts to remove it cause bleeding. Extensive membrane formation may\nresult in respiratory obstruction. \"The patient may recover at this point; or if enough toxin is\nabsorbed, develop severe prostration, striking pallor, rapid pulse,\nstupor, and coma, and may even die within 6 to 10 days. Fever is\nusually not high, even though the patient may appear quite toxic.\nPatients with severe disease may develop marked edema of the\nsubmandibular areas and the anterior neck along with lymphadenopathy,\ngiving a characteristic \"bull neck\" appearance. \"Most complications of diphtheria, including death, are attributable\nto effects of the toxin. The severity of the disease and complications\nare generally related to the extent of local disease. The toxin, when\nabsorbed, affects organs and tissues distant from the site of\ninvasion. The most frequent complications of diphtheria are\nmyocarditis and neuritis. Myocarditis may present as abnormal cardiac\nrhythms and can occur early in the course of the illness or weeks\nlater, and can lead to heart failure. If myocarditis occurs early, it\nis often fatal. Neuritis most often affects motor nerves and usually\nresolves completely. Paralysis of the soft palate is most frequent\nduring the 3rd week of illness. Paralysis of eye muscles, limbs, and\ndiaphragm can occur after the 5th week. Secondary pneumonia and\nrespiratory failure may result from diaphragmatic paralysis. Other\ncomplications include otitis media and respiratory insufficiency due\nto airway obstruction, especially in infants.\" - Mod.LL ","keywordsMatched":[]},"31":{"title":"Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (86): Africa,\r\n\tAsia ","date":["18","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (86): Africa,\r\n\tAsia [EXTERNAL]","summary":"\nCHOLERA, DIARRHEA AND DYSENTERY UPDATE (86): AFRICA, ASIA\n*\nA ProMED-mail post\n(http://www.promedmail.org)\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n(http://www.isid.org) In this update:\nAfrica\n\n<br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Cholera - Congo DR, West Africa\n<br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Cholera - Tanzania\n<br><br><strong>{3}</strong> Cholera - Sudan\nAsia\n\n<br><br><strong>{4}</strong> Cholera - Pakistan (Punjab Province) \n<br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Cholera - Congo DR, West Africa.\nDate: Fri 18 Aug 2017.\nSource: CAJ News Africa (edited)\n(http://cajnewsafrica.com/2017/08/18/hundreds-dead-in-raging-cholera-outbreak/) \nAt least 462 people have died in the conflict-torn Democratic Republic\nof Congo following a cholera outbreak sweeping through Central and\nWest Africa.

Ending the outbreak and preventing its spread beyond Tanzania's\nborders is a high priority for WHO. To that end, WHO and partners\nsupport a well-coordinated multisectoral response through the National\nCholera Task Force which plans, coordinates and support subnational\nauthorities. Indeed, learning requires a continuous assessment of performance, a\nreview of successes and failures and a robust support for improvement.\nAn After Action Review (AAR) is a simple methodology for facilitating\nthis assessment. It provides for a qualitative review of actions taken\nto respond to an emergency as a means of identifying best practices,\ngaps and lessons learned. As a component of the IHR Monitoring and\nEvaluation Framework (IHR MEF) and part of the preparedness and\nresponse cycle, an AAR seeks to identify what worked well or not and\nhow these practices can be maintained, improved, institutionalized and\nshared with relevant stakeholders. It is within this context that WHO\nsupported the Ministry of Health to convene a meeting of experts to\nconduct an After Action Review following the national response to the\ncholera outbreak. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{3}</strong> Cholera - Sudan.\nDate: Thu 17 Aug 2017.\nSource: Radio Dabanga (edited)\n(http://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/cholera-new-deaths-and-infections-across-sudan) \nSinga Hospital in Sudan's Sennar received 16 new cases of cholera\nduring the 1st half of this week week of Sun 13 Aug 2017.

From Saturday to Monday 12-14 Aug 2017,\n26 cases of cholera arrived from Um Benin village. This led the local\nhealth authorities to open a new cholera isolation centre at the\nvillage. El Gedaref State\nEl Gedaref Hospital in East Sudan recorded 15 cases of cholera on\nTuesday and Wednesday 15-16 Aug 2017. A medical source told Radio\nDabanga that the hospital received 9 cases on Tue 15 Aug 2017, while\n6 cases were recorded on Wed 16Aug 2017.

The 1st 2 cases of\ncholera were tested positive by National Institute of Health Islamabad\non Mon 31 Jul 2017 and another 2 confirmed positive for the\ninfection on Fri 4 Aug 2017. All the 4 patients were undergoing\ntreatment at Benazir Bhutto Hospital BH where as many as 4 more\nsuspects of the infection have been admitted for treatment. Data collected by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017 reveals that the\nallied hospitals have sent stool samples of over 10 child patients to\nNIH for confirmation of cholera in last week week of Sun 6 Aug\n2017. On Sat 12 Aug 2017, as many as 20 child patients with severe\ndiarrhoea were admitted at the BBH of which 4 were suspected as\npatients of cholera and their stool samples were sent to NIH for\nconfirmation, said Associate Professor of Paediatrics at Rawalpindi\nMedical University Dr Tariq Saeed when contacted by 'The News' on Mon\n14 Aug 2017. He added the hospital has not received confirmation reports from the\nNIH because of holidays there from Saturday to Monday. However, we\nhave been keeping the suspects in isolation under strict monitoring,\nhe said. He added that repeated rainfalls in the region and water inundation\ninside and outside homes in a number of localities particularly in\nthickly populated areas of the city are causing contamination of water\nand foodstuff that increases chances of spread of a number of\ninfections among population while children are at greater risk of\ncontracting life-threatening infections including cholera. It is important that the transmission of cholera occurs primarily by\ndrinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the feces\n(waste product) of an infected person, including one with no apparent\nsymptoms. It is observed that heavy rainfall causes collection of heavily\ncontaminated water in streets and houses and the waste water flooding\nout of various nullahs watercourses including Nullah Leh in town\ncauses infections including cholera, typhoid, dysentery,\ngastroenteritis, hepatitis A and E, shigellosis and giardiasis. Professor Tariq said the consumption of contaminated water and\nfoodstuff causes cholera, an infection in the small intestine caused\nby bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. Its main symptoms are watery diarrhea\nand vomiting that can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte\nimbalance, and death in cases which are not treated in time, he said. Health experts say that to avoid cholera and other infections, one\nmust use boiled water for drinking and should use vegetables after\nwashing with clean water and it must be kept in mind that raw\nvegetables should not be eaten in the existing weather conditions\ninstead these should be used after cooking. To a query, Professor Tariq said the heavy rainfall and water\naccumulation may contaminate water at sources and there may be chances\nof contamination of water at tube wells so individuals must boil water\nbefore drinking to avoid cholera and other infections. He added the appearance of cholera is alarming and it is time for\npeople to take extra ordinary preventive measures to safeguard their\nchildren and themselves from the disease. In case water is accumulated inside home due to heavy rainfall and\nflooded out of sewage lines, it must be wiped out immediately and the\nspace should be washed with clean water as soon as possible to avoid\ninfections. Avoiding inundation of contaminated water inside homes is\na must to avoid cholera and other infections, said Professor Tariq.

The\nfollowing is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In:\nChronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract.\nGreydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in\npress): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons,\nvaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside\nof Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as\n60-80 percent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection\nlengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are: - Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 percent (95 percent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam; - Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses.

Shipped from Amsterdam to Miami after participating in Sweden and UK  An American dressage horse returning to the United States after a competition tour in Europe could be euthanized or shipped back out of the country after testing positive for glanders during routine USDA equine import quarantine.  Glanders is a highly contagious upper respiratory disease that can be passed from horse-to-horse as well as to human handlers. Acute clinical signs include fever; cough; difficulty breathing; nasal discharge; swollen and painful submaxillary lymph nodes (the \"glands\" in \"glanders\"); rapidly spreading ulcers on the nasal mucosa, nodules, and chronic abscesses; and small abscesses in the lung and/or abscesses in the liver or spleen, among others. Clinical signs of chronic glanders include coughing; malaise; weight loss; intermittent fever; possible thick nasal discharge, usually out of one nostril; ulcers and nodules on the nasal mucosa; enlarged submaxillary lymph nodes; chronic enlargement and induration (hardening) of lymphatics and lymph nodes; joint swelling and painful leg edema (fluid swelling); and nodules, particularly on the legs, that rupture, release pus, and ulcerate. Glanders has been eradicated from North American and was last reported in the United States in the 1940s. It's recently been reported in several areas around the world, however, including South America, Eastern Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and a rare case in Germany in 2014.  Earlier this month August 2017, the 18-year-old Dutch Warmblood gelding Sagacious HF was shipped from Amsterdam to the Miami International Airport after participating in competitions in Sweden and England with Chase Hickok. Under USDA rules, all horses entering the United States, except those coming from Canada, must be quarantined and tested for 4 diseases  dourine, glanders, equine piroplasmosis, and equine infectious anemia  upon arrival.  Jeanine Neskey, interim public affairs specialist for the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), said an animal that produces a positive test result is denied entry to the United States.  \"Denied entry means that it must be either removed from the U.S. or be euthanized,\" she said. \"If the horse is denied entry into the U.S. (and not euthanized), the owner is free to take the horse to any other country that will accept it.\"  Scott Leibsle, DVM, Idaho's deputy state veterinarian, said Sagacious could have contracted the disease through contaminated feed or through water buckets also used by other horses participating in competitions. The gelding might also have been an asymptomatic carrier of the disease, possibly developing signs after experiencing stress  \"Transport is the most stressful thing you can do to a horse,\" he said. \"At the same time, you're putting it with new animals in a new area, and putting it under the stress of competition.\"  Currently APHIS uses a complement fixation test (CFT) to detect glanders. However, the agency is evaluating other testing methods, including the Western Blot procedure.  \"Advancing research and improved technology continue to develop new or improved testing methods for animal diseases,\" Neskey said. \"USDA routinely evaluates all testing methods available and incorporates the methods most appropriate to the needs of import quarantine testing.\"  After Sagacious produced a 2nd positive CFT glanders test, he produced a negative Western Blot glanders test. Arrangements were made to place him on extended quarantine pending the results of additional testing with both tests, slated for Wed 23 Aug 2017.  Byline: Pat Raia   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  Glanders, also known as farcy, is a contagious infectious disease of equines, acute or chronic, usually fatal, caused by the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_, and characterized by the development of ulcerated nodules that are most commonly found in the upper airway, lungs ,and skin. Felines and other animals are susceptible to infection, which is usually fatal. Humans can be infected and the microorganism (_B. mallei_) is considered a potential bioterrorism agent.  The disease, one among the oldest known and that used to be prevalent worldwide, is currently eradicated or effectively controlled in many countries. Recently the disease has been reported in some countries, including Iraq, Turkey, Pakistan, India, Mongolia, China, Brazil, United Arab Emirates, and countries in Africa. Glanders is one of the diseases contained in the list of diseases for mandatory reporting to the World Animal Health Organization (OIE).  The bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_ a clonal pathogen, can be found in nasal secretions and skin ulcers of infected animals. The transmission of glanders occurs commonly from intake of water or food contaminated with nasal secretions and exudates eliminated from infected animals, contact with contaminated equipment (saddles, harness) and by eating contaminated equine meat.  In the nasal form, nodules arise in septum and turbinates. Nodules progress to irregular edged ulcers; star-shaped scars are characteristic after the resolution of the ulcers. In the early stage, submandibular lymph nodes are enlarged and edematous, adhering to the skin and deep tissues in advanced stages of the disease. In the pulmonary form, inflammatory nodules with caseous or calcified centers are found in the lungs. With the progression of the disease areas of consolidation and pneumonia may be present. The nodules may break and eliminate the inflammatory content into the bronchial tree, spreading the infection to the upper respiratory tract. In the cutaneous form, nodules arise along the lymphatic vessels, especially on the extremities. The nodules may degenerate to form ulcers with drainage of highly infectious purulent material. The liver and spleen may have typical nodular lesions. Histologically, vasculitis, thrombosis, inflammatory cell infiltration and degeneration can be seen.  A test based on complement fixation can also be used for screening, but the ELISA test, although more sensitive, is not being routinely used. PCR can be used for specific identification ((https://www.merckvetmanual.com/generalized-conditions/glanders/overview-of-glanders)).  There are no vaccines. Prevention and control depend on early detection and eliminating infected animals in addition to quarantine and complete disinfection. Treatment, administered only in endemic areas, which does not lead to microbiological cure, is the use of doxycycline, ceftazidime, gentamycin, or streptomycin. Sulfa drugs (including in combination with trimethoprim) seem to be effective in prevention and glanders treatment ((http://www.merckmanuals.com/vet/generalized_conditions/glanders/overview_of_glanders.html?qt=glanders&alt=sh#Diagnosis)).  For glanders-free countries, there are OIE recommendations on importing equines. An international veterinary certificate is required attesting that the animals showed no clinical signs of glanders and were kept in an exporting country free of the disease for at least 6 months prior to shipment ((http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/GLA-EN.pdf)). It appears foreign horse owners will not be able to comply, therefore will be unable to repatriate their show horses? Further information would be welcome.  OIE WAHID's latest information shows continuing glanders in Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais states in 2014 (red circles on map; zoom in), but there have been no immediate or continuing event reports for Brazil in 2015. The OIE report and map are available at (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=11974).  As a horse owner, this would be devastating. We certainly hope Sagacious test later this month August 2017 clears him of this disease. - Mod.TG  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/212).

This came about after 2\nkidney recipients in Taiwan were diagnosed with dengue 2 days after\nreceiving a kidney each from the same donor, said National Cheng Kung\nUniversity microbiology and immunology professor Dr Oscar Perng\nGuey-chuen. \"This indicates a potential risk,\" the Taiwan-based\nscientist said, adding that no dengue virus was detected in the\ndonor's blood. He said the donor contracted dengue in 2015 and in mid-2016, he died\nin an accident. His family donated his corneas, liver, heart, and\nkidneys. Both patients had the same strain of the dengue virus the\ndonor had in 2015 and one of the recipients died of dengue\nhaemorrhagic fever, he said. Asked where the virus could be hiding since it could not be detected\nin the blood, he said it was a question scientists are trying to\nanswer. Interestingly, those who received the donor's corneas, liver,\nand heart did not develop dengue, Dr Perng said on the sidelines of\nthe National Dengue And Arboviruses Infection Conference 2017\nyesterday 12 Aug 2017. He said although there was not enough\nevidence to show the virus came from the donor as the kidneys were not\ntested for dengue before the transplant, the same virus was found in\nthe patients' bodies after that. Dr Perng said his team had studied mice for dengue virus in the blood\ntestes, kidney, liver, spleen and brain, and found the virus present\nin the kidneys and brain. \"We believe the virus probably resided in\nthe kidneys and was not cleared by the body,\" he said, adding that the\nvirus could have been activated after transplant. He said this raised\nconcerns about asymptomatic people who are dengue carriers. Health Ministry deputy director, general Datuk Dr S Jeyaindran said\npatients with severe dengue would have better recovery if they were\ngiven colloids, a more concentrated fluid, at the early stage in fluid\nmanagement for dengue patients. Dr Jeyaindran, who was representing\nHealth Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam, said colloids may be\nintroduced at an earlier stage, instead of saline because it has not\nbeen successful in treating patients with severe dengue. He said more\nstudies will be conducted to find out at which stage the colloids\nshould be given. byline: Loh Foon Fong \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) - Air travel related spread of dengue.\nDate: Thu 3 Aug 2017.\nSource: Medical Xpress (edited)\n(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-08-air-responsible-dengue-asia.html) \nWhile the incidences of many other infectious diseases have declined\nover the past decade, the number of cases and outbreaks of dengue\nvirus have continued to increase. The spread of dengue to new areas is\nlikely due in large part to trends in air travel, researchers now\nreport in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Dengue virus affects as estimated 390 million people around the globe\neach year, and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild fever and\nheadache to severe low blood pressure. The virus has mostly caused\ndisease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, but a 2014\noutbreak in Japan broke that pattern. Overall, the geographic area\naffected by dengue has been growing in recent years. In the new work, Huaiyu Tian and Bing Xu, both of Beijing Normal\nUniversity, China, together with colleagues from the University of\nOxford and elsewhere analyzed the spread of dengue viruses in Asia\nfrom 1956 to 2015. They used 2202 genetic sequences of dengue viruses,\ncollected in 20 countries or regions of Asia over the 59 years, to\ndetermine how different strains were related. They also investigated\ntrends in air travel, maritime mobility, migration, and\nsocio-economics to determine what factors impact the spread of\ndengue. The spread of 3 different dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1, -2, and -3,\nis associated with air traffic more so than any other factors, the\ndata revealed. Air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India, the\nresearchers found, help seed dengue epidemics, while China, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, and Singapore help diffuse the virus to other Asian\ncountries. \"Future trends in global mobility could potentially accelerate the\nappearance and diffusion of DENV worldwide,\" the researchers say.\n\"Prevention and control of dengue epidemics requires a better\nunderstanding of its mode of geographic dissemination, especially for\ncountries in the tropics.\" Reference: Tian H, Sun Z, Faria NR, et al.

Source: IOL (edited) (https://www.iol.co.za/capetimes/news/avian-flu-kills-30-000-chickens-on-farm-as-egg-scare-grows-10962801)   Avian flu has spread to a commercial layer poultry farm in the Western Cape province, killing at least 30 000 chickens. There are 140 000 chickens on the affected farm in the Paardeberg region, according to the provincial department of agriculture head of communication, Petro van Rhyn. She confirmed that at least 30 000 have died and said the rest would be culled.  The virus has not yet been confirmed as the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) type H5N8, which is the strain in outbreaks in other parts of the country. However, the H5 typing, and the nature of its effect on chickens, is indicative of it being the H5N8 strain, according to the department.  \nThe poultry industry raised concerns related to the principles and guidelines of compensating affected farms during a meeting with Zokwana last week. The draft guidelines have been completed and are subject to ministerial approval, Molapo said. The approved guidelines will be released by 1 Sep 2017.  \"The industry also requested to be given permission to import fertile eggs to close the supply gap as a result of culled birds.  \n\"Only one company has submitted an application for the importation of hatching eggs; the department is still performing the prescribed risk analyses to determine the appropriate level of risk.  \"We need to conduct a thorough risk assessment in order to avoid exposing the country to other disease risks,\" Molapo said.  There are 2 options which will be presented to the poultry industry - the 1st is for risk mitigation to be conducted in SA through stringent quarantine measures on arrival of the hatching eggs from their country of origin.  The 2nd option is for stringent quarantine measures in the country of origin where eggs will come from compartments free of specified diseases that Daff will approve, with less stringent post-arrival quarantine measures.  In Heidelberg a Western Cape town, 3 ostrich farms have tested positive for avian flu. No birds have died on the farms but they remain under quarantine. The 2 farms each have about 1000 ostriches. Van Rhyn said no decision to cull ostriches has been taken yet. She also said chicken in stores was safe for consumption.  \nBronwynne Jooste, spokesperson for Tourism, Economic Development and Agriculture MEC Alan Winde, said culling of the rest of the chickens and composting of mortalities had already been started.  Last week, the department's Veterinary Services programme confirmed the disease had spread to the farm. \"The cause is most likely through contact with wild birds. Since then, meetings with poultry veterinarians and stakeholders such as the National Institute for Communicable Diseases have taken place,\" Jooste said. The farm has been placed under quarantine.  She said farms within a 3 km approx 1.8 mi zone of an infected farm would be monitored closely and subjected to the control measures as laid out by the national Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (Daff)  \"It is strongly recommended that any movement of pet birds, racing pigeons, breeding birds and show birds be limited as far as possible and covered by a movement permit if coming from within 30 km approx 18 mi of an infected farm,\" said Jooste.  \nSick or dead birds - both wild birds and poultry - must be reported to local state vets, and exports of poultry and poultry products have been suspended except from poultry compartments registered with Daff, or where a country's import permit contains clauses that are able to be signed by a certifying veterinarian.  Winde said the virus presented a challenge to control, but the vets were working hard to contain the spread.  \n\"This is a priority for the poultry industry, and the entire agriculture sector. The outbreak and the current drought have made agriculture a tough space to be in.  \n\"This is a particularly difficult time for those affected farms, which are important employers. This is why we ask all stakeholders to continue working with us to mitigate the impact of this outbreak on our economy,\" Winde said.  Avian flu is a viral respiratory disease among birds, believed to be transmitted by wild migratory birds. The H5N8 strain of the disease has already wreaked havoc in the poultry industry in Zimbabwe, where thousands of commercial birds have died or had to be culled.  Bomikazi Molapo, spokesperson for Daff Minister Senzeni Zokwana, said South Africa had reported 8 further cases of HPAI H5N8 to the World Organisation for Animal Health see comment. This brings the total number of outbreaks to 24 since June this year 2017.  \"All affected properties have been placed under quarantine and disease control measures have commenced,\" she said.  \nByline: Lisa Isaacs   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail.

Source: Pajhwok Afghan News (edited) (https://www.pajhwok.com/en/2017/08/28/congo-virus-kills-13-infects-42-herat)   Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has killed 13 people in western Herat province this year 2017, with another 42 being treated for the deadly virus, according to officials.  CCHF is a viral disease. Symptoms may include fever, muscle pains, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding into the skin. The CCHF virus is typically spread by tick bites or contact with livestock carrying the disease.  Health officials in Herat advised people to be careful these days due to increased interaction with livestock in the wake of Eidul Adha Sacrifice Feast; 31 Aug-4 Sep 2017, when Muslims across the globe slaughter millions of animals.  Public health director in Herat Abdul Hakim Tamana said many people lost their lives to the Congo virus in the province this year 2017. He said 55 Congo cases were registered in the civil hospital since late March and of the patients, 13 had died. The deceased included 7 men and 6 women, he added.  Tamana said the virus spread from animals and people slaughtering animals should wear gloves.  A livestock farmer, who has contracted Congo virus, said: \"When I slaughtered the sheep, its blood covered my hands and later I started falling sick.\"  Ahmad Khalil Waez, animal healthcare director, said citizens should be careful while slaughtering animals to avoid contracting the Congo virus. He said a butcher should used special glasses, coat, gloves, mask, and shoes while slaughtering the animal.  People mainly contract the CCHF virus from infected ticks or contact with infected animal blood and tissue.  There are no vaccines available to immunize animals but precautionary measures include disinfection of livestock pens, submerging livestock in solutions for decontamination, and meat packaging safeguards.  The virus has had a presence in neighbouring Iran where the virus killed 3 people in 2015.  According to the World Health Organization, CCHF's mortality rate is about 30 percent and is endemic to Africa, the Balkans and Ukraine, the Middle East, and Central Asia.  CCHF was first detected in the Crimea in 1944 and then in the Congo in 1969. In 2011, it was detected for the first time in ticks in Spain.

(promed@promedmail.org)  In 2008, a major outbreak was reported in Herat City, western Afghanistan, with approximately 60 suspected and 6 confirmed cases. Later, a cross-sectional seroprevalence survey was conducted among livestock-owning households in the same districts of Herat City where the outbreak had occurred, which showed that IgG seroprevalence was 11.2 and 75.0 percent in humans (n = 330) and livestock (n = 132), respectively ((https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3310665/)).  In 2016, 66 cases had been reported by 7 Sep, with 12 deaths ((http://www.emro.who.int/afg/afghanistan-news/cchf-eid.html)). CCHF virus has been observed in over 30 countries, including in Africa (Democratic Republic of Congo, South Africa, Nigeria, Senegal, Uganda, Tanzania, Mauritania, Kenya), Asia (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, China), the Middle East (Iran, Iraq, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman), and southeastern Europe (the Russian Federation, Bulgaria, Albania, Kosovo, Turkey, Greece, and Spain) ((https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23458713)).  People most at risk of contracting CCHF include animal herders, livestock workers, butchers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Healthcare workers are also at risk of infection through unprotected contact with infectious blood and body fluids while caring for patients. There is no vaccine available for either people or animals, which means prevention is crucial. - Mod.UBA  Maps of Afghanistan can be seen at (http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/afghanistan_admin-2009.jpg) and (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1757). - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ  ","keywordsMatched":[]},"299":{"title":"Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (95): Africa, Asia","date":["31","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (95): Africa, Asia","summary":"\nCHOLERA, DIARRHEA AND DYSENTERY UPDATE (95): AFRICA, ASIA\n*\nA ProMED-mail post\n(http://www.promedmail.org)\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n(http://www.isid.org) In this update:\nAfrica\n\n<br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Cholera - Kenya (Nairobi)\n<br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Cholera - Kenya (Nairobi) police\n<br><br><strong>{3}</strong> Cholera - Kenya (Tana River county)\n<br><br><strong>{4}</strong>, <br><br><strong>{5}</strong> Cholera - Nigeria (Borno state) IDPs\n<br><br><strong>{6}</strong> Cholera - Sudan\n<br><br><strong>{7}</strong> Cholera, diarrhea - Eastern and Southern Africa Region\nAsia\n\n<br><br><strong>{8}</strong> Cholera - Pakistan (Punjab) \nAfrica\n\n<br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Cholera - Kenya (Nairobi).\nDate: Mon 4 Sep 2017 9:09 AM EAT.\nSource: Capital FM (edited)\n(https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2017/09/cholera-cases-in-nairobi-rise-to-88/) \nThe number of people admitted to various hospitals in Nairobi after\ntesting positive for cholera has now risen to 88.

Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as\n60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection\nlengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:\n- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit.

In Central America and the Caribbean, influenza activity continued to be reported in a few countries. Influenza activity remained at low levels in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere. Worldwide, influenza A(H3N2) viruses are predominating.  In temperate South America, respiratory illness indicators and influenza activity decreased in most of the sub-region, with influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominating.  In Southern Africa, influenza activity appeared to have plateaued in South Africa, with influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominantly detected.  In Oceania, seasonal influenza activity continued to increase, with influenza A(H3N2) and B viruses present in the region.  In tropical South America, influenza and other respiratory virus activity remained low.  In the Caribbean and Central American countries, respiratory illness indicators and influenza activity remained low in general, but respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) activity was increasing.  In Southern Asia, increased influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus detections were reported in India. Severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and influenza like illness (ILI) indicators remained high in Bhutan.  In South East Asia, increased influenza activity was reported in recent weeks, with all seasonal influenza subtypes present in the region.  In East and Western Asia, influenza activity remained low in general.  In Western Africa, influenza activity continued to be reported, with all seasonal influenza subtypes present in the region. Few influenza detections were reported in Eastern Africa.  In Northern Africa, no influenza virus detections were reported.  In Central Asia, there were no updated reports on virus detections or respiratory illness indicators.  In Europe and North America, little to no influenza activity was reported.  National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 64 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the period from 7-20 Aug 2017 (data as of 2017-09-01 04:28:36 UTC). The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 48522 specimens during that period. 7438 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 6637 (89.2 percent) were typed as influenza A and 801 (10.8 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 746 (14 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and 4586 (86 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 99 (53.8 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 85 (46.2 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail.

The students are from Sangmyung University's Cheonan Campus in South Chungcheong Province, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Mon 21 Aug 2017. They had visited India's northern region, including the cities of Agra and New Delhi, with 18 other students and 2 instructors as part of the school's overseas education program from 19 to 27 Jul 2017.  After they returned, 7 sought medical attention for fever, chills, and diarrhea. 4 were diagnosed with typhoid. In a follow-up check, another student was diagnosed with the disease. 4 of the 5 students remain in a hospital. One student was released on Fri 18 Aug 2017.  Of 225 Koreans who caught typhoid fever abroad between 2011-2016, 23 per cent had visited India. The health authority has advised that people planning to visit India should be vaccinated against the waterborne disease, which is also infectious through food.  Health officials also said that people who experience fever, chills, and diarrhea within 60 days  the disease's maximum latency period  after returning from India must report to a hospital to be checked for the disease.  byline: Ko Dong-hwan   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  Typhoid fever, so-called enteric fever caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi, often has a totally different presentation from that of the commoner kinds of salmonellosis. Epidemiologically, usually spread by contaminated food or water, typhoid is not a zoonosis like the commoner types of salmonellosis. Clinically, vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent; indeed, constipation is frequently reported. As it is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive.  The symptoms of classical typhoid fever typically include fever, anorexia, lethargy, malaise, dull continuous headache, non-productive cough, vague abdominal pain, and constipation. Despite the often high fever, the pulse is often only slightly elevated. During the 2nd week of the illness, there is protracted fever and mental dullness, classically called coma vigil. Diarrhea may develop but usually does not. Many patients develop hepatosplenomegaly both liver and spleen enlarged. After the 1st week or so, many cases develop a maculopapular rash on the upper abdomen. These lesions (\"rose spots\") are about 2 cm 0.78 in in diameter and blanch on pressure. They persist for 2-4 days and may come and go. Mild and atypical infections are common.  The word typhoid (as in typhus-like) reflects the similarity of the louseborne rickettsial disease epidemic typhus and that of typhoid fever; in fact, in some areas, typhoid fever is still referred to as abdominal typhus.

The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare is advising tourists to go to hospital if they develop a high fever or generalized rash after returning to Japan.  Although the World Health Organization verified that Japan has eliminated infections of endemic measles strains in 2015, group infections originating from people who contracted the disease abroad are spreading in the country. As of 6 Aug 2017, the number of patients reached 169 this year in Japan, already eclipsing the figure in the previous year.  About 4100 patients in Italy and around 6500 patients in Romania have already been confirmed as of August 2017 compared with about 860 and 2000, respectively, throughout 2016, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.  Symptoms of the highly contagious disease include runny nose, red and watery eyes, high fever, and rash. The virus is spread through coughing and sneezing and can cause complications such as pneumonia and can even result in death in one in 1000 patients, according to the ministry. The ministry recommends people traveling overseas to check their vaccination records and take an additional shot if they have only been vaccinated once.  The disease was prevalent about a decade ago in Japan with the number of patients soaring to over 10 000 in 2008 but the country was later considered as free from infections of the virus.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Japan can be found at (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/156). - Mod.LK   <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Australia (Perth, Western Australia): ex Italy.

Large measles outbreak introduced by asylum seekers and spread among the insufficiently vaccinated resident population, Berlin, October 2014 to August 2015. Euro Surveill. 2017; 22(34): pii=30599 - Abstract  The largest measles outbreak in Berlin since 2001 occurred from October 2014 to August 2015. Overall, 1344 cases were ascertained, 86 per cent (with available information) unvaccinated, including 146 (12 per cent) asylum seekers. Median age was 17 years (interquartile range: 4-29 years), 26 per cent were hospitalised and a 1 year old child died. Measles virus genotyping uniformly revealed the variant 'D8-Rostov-Don' and descendants. The virus was likely introduced by and initially spread among asylum seekers before affecting Berlin's resident population. Among Berlin residents, the highest incidence was in children younger than 2 years, yet most cases (52 per cent) were adults. Post-exposure vaccinations in homes for asylum seekers, not always conducted, occurred later (median: 7.5 days) than the recommended 72 hours after onset of the 1st case and reached only half of potential contacts. Asylum seekers should not only have non-discriminatory, equitable access to vaccination, they also need to be offered measles vaccination in a timely fashion, that is, immediately upon arrival in the receiving country. Supplementary immunisation activities targeting the resident population, particularly adults, are urgently needed in Berlin.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail.

A 10 month old girl, who was a refugee from Iraq, became the 33rd person to die of the infection, reports local Digi24. The girl arrived in Romania on 7 Jul 2017 with her family, and the doctors diagnosed her with measles in August. They also discovered that the child was suffering from malnutrition and severe psychomotor retardation.  The measles outbreak is still a major problem in Romania, with more than 8900 cases reported across the country until 25 Aug 2017, including 33 deaths, according to data from the National Center for Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases (CNSCBT). Most deaths were registered in Timis (9), Dolj (7), and Arad (6) counties.  Measles is a highly contagious respiratory infection caused by a virus. It causes a total-body skin rash and flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough, and runny nose. According to information posted on WHO's website, the virus is highly contagious, spreading by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact, and direct contact with infected nasal or throat secretions. Unvaccinated young children pose the highest risk of measles and its complications, including death.  The Romanian Government adopted earlier this month August 2017 a draft bill on the organization and financing of population vaccination (https://www.romania-insider.com/romania-draft-bill-vaccination/). The project was sent to the Parliament for approval and could come into force in January 2018.  byline: Irina Marica   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Measles tends to be more severe in children who are malnourished, especially children who are also vitamin A deficient. And complications are commoner and more serious in malnourished children. Because of complications such as diarrhoea, measles may lead to failure to thrive. Infection with measles virus may lead to kwashiorkor or marasmus in children who are underweight at the time that they get infected. Therefore, measles may result in, or aggravate, malnutrition.

Source: News-Medical/Life Sciences (edited) (https://www.news-medical.net/news/20170826/New-study-highlights-role-played-by-demographics-in-the-spread-of-measles.aspx)   Even if the incidence of measles infection has decreased by at least 90 per cent worldwide since the introduction of the vaccine, measles is still one of the major causes of death in children among vaccine-preventable diseases. Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world.  A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries.  Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years.  \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\"  \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea\".  The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years 2 million DALYs since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln 13 million DALYs in the US, and 36-mln 36 million DALYs in Ethiopia.  \"Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,\" continues Prof Melegaro \"our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population. Tailoring immunization campaigns to achieve measles eradication goals is essential and currently, for some countries, this means considering also the role of unprotected adolescents and young adults.\"   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Reference - Trentini F, Poletti P, Merler S, Melegaro A.

Authorities are not ruling out the possibility that the 8 individuals contracted hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), widely known as \"hamburger disease,\" a bacterial infection that can leave the renal system severely damaged. Many cases are caused by _E. coli_, which can be found in undercooked meat like hamburgers. Children under the age of 5 are particularly vulnerable. On 25 Aug 2017, a group of 15 adults and elementary school students from the same church in Jeonju visited McDonald's Jeonju branch and ate bulgogi burgers together. A day later, 7 children and 1 adult experienced diarrhea and vomiting. The authorities declared an epidemiological probe into the case on Sat 2 Sep 2017.  As the case was publicized, McDonald's Korea halted selling bulgogi burgers nationwide starting on Sat 2 Sep 2017. On its website, a notice says, \"We have decided to stop selling bulgogi burgers pending the outcome of the ongoing investigation by authorities,\" adding that the multinational company's Korean branch was taking the issue seriously. It also said the company will do its best to help patients recover, though without elaborating on how or when.  The outcome of the ongoing probe is expected to be made public around Wed 6 Sep 2017.  The case in Jeonju is not the only incident that the corporation, which has 440 branches in Korea alone, has recently found itself in. In July 2017, the mother of a 5-year-old girl filed a complaint claiming irreparable harm was done to her child because of the fast food chain's mismanagement of its food products. The mother, claimed her daughter contracted HUS after eating a Happy Meal in September 2016, and she now must undergo peritoneal dialysis on a daily basis.  McDonald's Korea branch also received a complaint from the parents of a 2-year-old girl, who began to have diarrhea and bloody excrement after eating a hamburger patty on 17 May 2017 at a Jamsil branch in southern Seoul.

A one day incubation period is short for EHEC but the outbreak is occurring in the wake of several cases of EHEC linked to the chain in South Korea.  Classic bulgogi recipes use a marinade of soy, ginger, garlic, and gochujang (Korean chili paste) to flavor and tenderize strips of meat. Because combining a marinade into ground beef would change the consistency of the hamburger, making it more of a \"sloppy-joe\", usually a bulgogi inspired sauce is used on top of the burger although a Korean inspired spice combination can be added to the ground beef.

Ending the outbreak and preventing its spread beyond Tanzania's\nborders is a high priority for WHO. To that end, WHO and partners\nsupport a well-coordinated multisectoral response through the National\nCholera Task Force which plans, coordinates and support subnational\nauthorities. Indeed, learning requires a continuous assessment of performance, a\nreview of successes and failures and a robust support for improvement.\nAn After Action Review (AAR) is a simple methodology for facilitating\nthis assessment. It provides for a qualitative review of actions taken\nto respond to an emergency as a means of identifying best practices,\ngaps and lessons learned. As a component of the IHR Monitoring and\nEvaluation Framework (IHR MEF) and part of the preparedness and\nresponse cycle, an AAR seeks to identify what worked well or not and\nhow these practices can be maintained, improved, institutionalized and\nshared with relevant stakeholders. It is within this context that WHO\nsupported the Ministry of Health to convene a meeting of experts to\nconduct an After Action Review following the national response to the\ncholera outbreak. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{3}</strong> Cholera - Sudan.\nDate: Thu 17 Aug 2017.\nSource: Radio Dabanga (edited)\n(http://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/cholera-new-deaths-and-infections-across-sudan) \nSinga Hospital in Sudan's Sennar received 16 new cases of cholera\nduring the 1st half of this week week of Sun 13 Aug 2017.

From Saturday to Monday 12-14 Aug 2017,\n26 cases of cholera arrived from Um Benin village. This led the local\nhealth authorities to open a new cholera isolation centre at the\nvillage. El Gedaref State\nEl Gedaref Hospital in East Sudan recorded 15 cases of cholera on\nTuesday and Wednesday 15-16 Aug 2017. A medical source told Radio\nDabanga that the hospital received 9 cases on Tue 15 Aug 2017, while\n6 cases were recorded on Wed 16Aug 2017.

The 1st 2 cases of\ncholera were tested positive by National Institute of Health Islamabad\non Mon 31 Jul 2017 and another 2 confirmed positive for the\ninfection on Fri 4 Aug 2017. All the 4 patients were undergoing\ntreatment at Benazir Bhutto Hospital BH where as many as 4 more\nsuspects of the infection have been admitted for treatment. Data collected by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017 reveals that the\nallied hospitals have sent stool samples of over 10 child patients to\nNIH for confirmation of cholera in last week week of Sun 6 Aug\n2017. On Sat 12 Aug 2017, as many as 20 child patients with severe\ndiarrhoea were admitted at the BBH of which 4 were suspected as\npatients of cholera and their stool samples were sent to NIH for\nconfirmation, said Associate Professor of Paediatrics at Rawalpindi\nMedical University Dr Tariq Saeed when contacted by 'The News' on Mon\n14 Aug 2017. He added the hospital has not received confirmation reports from the\nNIH because of holidays there from Saturday to Monday. However, we\nhave been keeping the suspects in isolation under strict monitoring,\nhe said. He added that repeated rainfalls in the region and water inundation\ninside and outside homes in a number of localities particularly in\nthickly populated areas of the city are causing contamination of water\nand foodstuff that increases chances of spread of a number of\ninfections among population while children are at greater risk of\ncontracting life-threatening infections including cholera. It is important that the transmission of cholera occurs primarily by\ndrinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the feces\n(waste product) of an infected person, including one with no apparent\nsymptoms. It is observed that heavy rainfall causes collection of heavily\ncontaminated water in streets and houses and the waste water flooding\nout of various nullahs watercourses including Nullah Leh in town\ncauses infections including cholera, typhoid, dysentery,\ngastroenteritis, hepatitis A and E, shigellosis and giardiasis. Professor Tariq said the consumption of contaminated water and\nfoodstuff causes cholera, an infection in the small intestine caused\nby bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. Its main symptoms are watery diarrhea\nand vomiting that can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte\nimbalance, and death in cases which are not treated in time, he said. Health experts say that to avoid cholera and other infections, one\nmust use boiled water for drinking and should use vegetables after\nwashing with clean water and it must be kept in mind that raw\nvegetables should not be eaten in the existing weather conditions\ninstead these should be used after cooking. To a query, Professor Tariq said the heavy rainfall and water\naccumulation may contaminate water at sources and there may be chances\nof contamination of water at tube wells so individuals must boil water\nbefore drinking to avoid cholera and other infections. He added the appearance of cholera is alarming and it is time for\npeople to take extra ordinary preventive measures to safeguard their\nchildren and themselves from the disease. In case water is accumulated inside home due to heavy rainfall and\nflooded out of sewage lines, it must be wiped out immediately and the\nspace should be washed with clean water as soon as possible to avoid\ninfections. Avoiding inundation of contaminated water inside homes is\na must to avoid cholera and other infections, said Professor Tariq.

Date: Mon 21 Aug 2017. Source: Sudan Tribune (edited) (http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article63300)   An outbreak of malaria in South Sudan has killed over 4000 people since February 2017, a senior health official disclosed last week week of Sun 13 Aug 2017. \"This year's malaria is the most severe the country has ever seen,\" Dr Isaac Mapeer, the deputy head of the Malaria Control Program at South Sudan's Ministry of Health, told Anadolu Agency on Thu 17 Aug 2017. A total of over 900 000 malaria cases had so far been registered, according to Mapeer. \"Up to 4073 deaths were recorded since February 2017, while 2000 deaths were reported in 2016\", he stressed.  Malaria is a life-threatening mosquitoborne blood disease caused by a plasmodium parasite, which is usually transmitted to humans through the bite of the anopheles mosquito. Once an infected mosquito bites a human, the parasites multiply in the host's liver before infecting and destroying red blood cells.  According to the senior health official, the country's Epidemic Task Force, headed by the Ministry of Health in partnership with United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and other partners has also stepped up efforts to fight the disease.  The health official, however, decried the lack of funds to fight malaria and appealed for donations to help fight the disease. In July 2017, OCHA said more than 76 per cent of disease-related deaths in South Sudan are from malaria.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  According to the WHO 2016 World Malaria Report ((http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/252038/1/9789241511711-eng.pdf?ua=1)), malaria control in South Sudan was entirely dependent on foreign aid donations and the report stated that 60 per cent of the population sleeps under an impregnated bed net.  However, the civil war in the country probably means that malaria control activities and probably drug distribution have been impaired, which could be one explanation for the reported outbreak. - Mod.EP  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/8402).

A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam;\n- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however,\nhave suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be\neffective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and\noutbreak situations (63, 64). \"References\n\n57.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness\nand disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE,\nAtay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral\nrehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and\nother forms of diarrhea: \"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that\ncholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement,\nand, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not\nuntil 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of\nthe intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could\nbe effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the\nintravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could\nbe just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for\nexample, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy\n(ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the\nmorbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1)\nhighlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn\nBangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per\ncent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as\n\"potentially the most important medical advance\" of the 20th century.\nA variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice\npowder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially\nzinc (5). \"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to\napproximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those\nwith severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously\nwith a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of\n20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg\nover the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser\ndegrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or\nrice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those\nwith no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with\nfrequent reevaluation. \"References\n-\n1.

The\nfollowing is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In:\nChronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract.\nGreydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in\npress): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons,\nvaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside\nof Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as\n60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection\nlengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:\n- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam;\n- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however,\nhave suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be\neffective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and\noutbreak situations (63, 64). \"References\n\n57.

Source: Pajhwok Afghan News (edited) (https://www.pajhwok.com/en/2017/08/28/congo-virus-kills-13-infects-42-herat)   Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has killed 13 people in western Herat province this year 2017, with another 42 being treated for the deadly virus, according to officials.  CCHF is a viral disease. Symptoms may include fever, muscle pains, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding into the skin. The CCHF virus is typically spread by tick bites or contact with livestock carrying the disease.  Health officials in Herat advised people to be careful these days due to increased interaction with livestock in the wake of Eidul Adha Sacrifice Feast; 31 Aug-4 Sep 2017, when Muslims across the globe slaughter millions of animals.  Public health director in Herat Abdul Hakim Tamana said many people lost their lives to the Congo virus in the province this year 2017. He said 55 Congo cases were registered in the civil hospital since late March and of the patients, 13 had died. The deceased included 7 men and 6 women, he added.  Tamana said the virus spread from animals and people slaughtering animals should wear gloves.  A livestock farmer, who has contracted Congo virus, said: \"When I slaughtered the sheep, its blood covered my hands and later I started falling sick.\"  Ahmad Khalil Waez, animal healthcare director, said citizens should be careful while slaughtering animals to avoid contracting the Congo virus. He said a butcher should used special glasses, coat, gloves, mask, and shoes while slaughtering the animal.  People mainly contract the CCHF virus from infected ticks or contact with infected animal blood and tissue.  There are no vaccines available to immunize animals but precautionary measures include disinfection of livestock pens, submerging livestock in solutions for decontamination, and meat packaging safeguards.  The virus has had a presence in neighbouring Iran where the virus killed 3 people in 2015.  According to the World Health Organization, CCHF's mortality rate is about 30 percent and is endemic to Africa, the Balkans and Ukraine, the Middle East, and Central Asia.  CCHF was first detected in the Crimea in 1944 and then in the Congo in 1969. In 2011, it was detected for the first time in ticks in Spain.  Byline: Storai Karimi   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  In 2008, a major outbreak was reported in Herat City, western Afghanistan, with approximately 60 suspected and 6 confirmed cases. Later, a cross-sectional seroprevalence survey was conducted among livestock-owning households in the same districts of Herat City where the outbreak had occurred, which showed that IgG seroprevalence was 11.2 and 75.0 percent in humans (n = 330) and livestock (n = 132), respectively ((https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3310665/)).  In 2016, 66 cases had been reported by 7 Sep, with 12 deaths ((http://www.emro.who.int/afg/afghanistan-news/cchf-eid.html)). CCHF virus has been observed in over 30 countries, including in Africa (Democratic Republic of Congo, South Africa, Nigeria, Senegal, Uganda, Tanzania, Mauritania, Kenya), Asia (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, China), the Middle East (Iran, Iraq, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman), and southeastern Europe (the Russian Federation, Bulgaria, Albania, Kosovo, Turkey, Greece, and Spain) ((https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23458713)).  People most at risk of contracting CCHF include animal herders, livestock workers, butchers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Healthcare workers are also at risk of infection through unprotected contact with infectious blood and body fluids while caring for patients. There is no vaccine available for either people or animals, which means prevention is crucial. - Mod.UBA  Maps of Afghanistan can be seen at (http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/afghanistan_admin-2009.jpg) and (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1757). - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ  ","keywordsMatched":[]}},"Sri Lanka":{"115":{"title":"Dengue/DHF update (10): Asia, Pacific, Africa, research, WHO\r\n\t","date":["25","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Dengue/DHF update (10): Asia, Pacific, Africa, research, WHO\r\n\t[EXTERNAL]","summary":"\nDENGUE/DHF UPDATE (10): ASIA, PACIFIC, AFRICA, RESEARCH, WHO\n\nA ProMED-mail post\n(http://www.promedmail.org)\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n(http://www.isid.org) In this update:\n<br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Cases in various countries Asia\n\nSri Lanka\n- National\n- National\n- National\nIndia\n- National\n- Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Assam\n- Delhi\n- Tamil Nadu (Coimbatore)\n- Tamil Nadu\n- Tamil Nadu (Chennai)\n- Tamil Nadu (Chennai)\n- Kerala\n- Karnataka\n- Karnataka (Gulbarga)\n- Karnataka (Gulbarga)\n- West Bengal (Kolkata)\n- West Bengal (Birbhum)\n- West Bengal (Siliguri)\n- Odisha (Ganjam)\n- Odisha\n- Gujarat (Ahmedabad)\n- Jharkhand (Jamshedpur)\n- Telangana (Hyderabad)\nPakistan\n- Sindh (Karachi)\n- Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (Peshawar)\n- Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (Peshawar)\n- Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (Peshawar)\nChina\n- Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region ex Viet Nam (susp)\n- Hong Kong SAR\n- Macau SAR\n- Macau SAR\nTaiwan\nMyanmar\n- National\n- Kayah\nIndonesia\n- Papua (Jayapura)\nViet Nam\n- National\n- National\n- Mekong Delta\n- Hanoi\n- Ha Nam\nPhilippines\n- National\n- Cebu\n- Negros Occidental\n- Negros Occidental (Bacolod City)\n- Cavite (Trece Martires City)\nLaos\n- National\nJapan ex Côte d'Ivoire Pacific\n\n- Samoa\n- Samoa\n- Samoa\n- Samoa\n- Fiji\n- French Polynesia (Tahiti) Africa\n\n- Côte d'Ivoire\n- Côte d'Ivoire <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Research\n- Viral persistence\n- Air travel related spread of dengue\n- Visual impact <br><br><strong>{3}</strong> World Health Organization update \n<br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Cases in various countries\nAsia\n\nSri Lanka\n- National. 26 Jul 2017.

This came about after 2\nkidney recipients in Taiwan were diagnosed with dengue 2 days after\nreceiving a kidney each from the same donor, said National Cheng Kung\nUniversity microbiology and immunology professor Dr Oscar Perng\nGuey-chuen. \"This indicates a potential risk,\" the Taiwan-based\nscientist said, adding that no dengue virus was detected in the\ndonor's blood. He said the donor contracted dengue in 2015 and in mid-2016, he died\nin an accident. His family donated his corneas, liver, heart, and\nkidneys. Both patients had the same strain of the dengue virus the\ndonor had in 2015 and one of the recipients died of dengue\nhaemorrhagic fever, he said. Asked where the virus could be hiding since it could not be detected\nin the blood, he said it was a question scientists are trying to\nanswer. Interestingly, those who received the donor's corneas, liver,\nand heart did not develop dengue, Dr Perng said on the sidelines of\nthe National Dengue And Arboviruses Infection Conference 2017\nyesterday 12 Aug 2017. He said although there was not enough\nevidence to show the virus came from the donor as the kidneys were not\ntested for dengue before the transplant, the same virus was found in\nthe patients' bodies after that. Dr Perng said his team had studied mice for dengue virus in the blood\ntestes, kidney, liver, spleen and brain, and found the virus present\nin the kidneys and brain. \"We believe the virus probably resided in\nthe kidneys and was not cleared by the body,\" he said, adding that the\nvirus could have been activated after transplant. He said this raised\nconcerns about asymptomatic people who are dengue carriers.

The spread of dengue to new areas is\nlikely due in large part to trends in air travel, researchers now\nreport in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Dengue virus affects as estimated 390 million people around the globe\neach year, and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild fever and\nheadache to severe low blood pressure. The virus has mostly caused\ndisease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, but a 2014\noutbreak in Japan broke that pattern. Overall, the geographic area\naffected by dengue has been growing in recent years. In the new work, Huaiyu Tian and Bing Xu, both of Beijing Normal\nUniversity, China, together with colleagues from the University of\nOxford and elsewhere analyzed the spread of dengue viruses in Asia\nfrom 1956 to 2015. They used 2202 genetic sequences of dengue viruses,\ncollected in 20 countries or regions of Asia over the 59 years, to\ndetermine how different strains were related. They also investigated\ntrends in air travel, maritime mobility, migration, and\nsocio-economics to determine what factors impact the spread of\ndengue. The spread of 3 different dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1, -2, and -3,\nis associated with air traffic more so than any other factors, the\ndata revealed. Air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India, the\nresearchers found, help seed dengue epidemics, while China, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, and Singapore help diffuse the virus to other Asian\ncountries. \"Future trends in global mobility could potentially accelerate the\nappearance and diffusion of DENV worldwide,\" the researchers say.\n\"Prevention and control of dengue epidemics requires a better\nunderstanding of its mode of geographic dissemination, especially for\ncountries in the tropics.\" Reference: Tian H, Sun Z, Faria NR, et al.

Ending the outbreak and preventing its spread beyond Tanzania's\nborders is a high priority for WHO. To that end, WHO and partners\nsupport a well-coordinated multisectoral response through the National\nCholera Task Force which plans, coordinates and support subnational\nauthorities. Indeed, learning requires a continuous assessment of performance, a\nreview of successes and failures and a robust support for improvement.\nAn After Action Review (AAR) is a simple methodology for facilitating\nthis assessment. It provides for a qualitative review of actions taken\nto respond to an emergency as a means of identifying best practices,\ngaps and lessons learned.

The 1st 2 cases of\ncholera were tested positive by National Institute of Health Islamabad\non Mon 31 Jul 2017 and another 2 confirmed positive for the\ninfection on Fri 4 Aug 2017. All the 4 patients were undergoing\ntreatment at Benazir Bhutto Hospital BH where as many as 4 more\nsuspects of the infection have been admitted for treatment. Data collected by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017 reveals that the\nallied hospitals have sent stool samples of over 10 child patients to\nNIH for confirmation of cholera in last week week of Sun 6 Aug\n2017. On Sat 12 Aug 2017, as many as 20 child patients with severe\ndiarrhoea were admitted at the BBH of which 4 were suspected as\npatients of cholera and their stool samples were sent to NIH for\nconfirmation, said Associate Professor of Paediatrics at Rawalpindi\nMedical University Dr Tariq Saeed when contacted by 'The News' on Mon\n14 Aug 2017. He added the hospital has not received confirmation reports from the\nNIH because of holidays there from Saturday to Monday. However, we\nhave been keeping the suspects in isolation under strict monitoring,\nhe said. He added that repeated rainfalls in the region and water inundation\ninside and outside homes in a number of localities particularly in\nthickly populated areas of the city are causing contamination of water\nand foodstuff that increases chances of spread of a number of\ninfections among population while children are at greater risk of\ncontracting life-threatening infections including cholera. It is important that the transmission of cholera occurs primarily by\ndrinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the feces\n(waste product) of an infected person, including one with no apparent\nsymptoms. It is observed that heavy rainfall causes collection of heavily\ncontaminated water in streets and houses and the waste water flooding\nout of various nullahs watercourses including Nullah Leh in town\ncauses infections including cholera, typhoid, dysentery,\ngastroenteritis, hepatitis A and E, shigellosis and giardiasis. Professor Tariq said the consumption of contaminated water and\nfoodstuff causes cholera, an infection in the small intestine caused\nby bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. Its main symptoms are watery diarrhea\nand vomiting that can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte\nimbalance, and death in cases which are not treated in time, he said. Health experts say that to avoid cholera and other infections, one\nmust use boiled water for drinking and should use vegetables after\nwashing with clean water and it must be kept in mind that raw\nvegetables should not be eaten in the existing weather conditions\ninstead these should be used after cooking. To a query, Professor Tariq said the heavy rainfall and water\naccumulation may contaminate water at sources and there may be chances\nof contamination of water at tube wells so individuals must boil water\nbefore drinking to avoid cholera and other infections. He added the appearance of cholera is alarming and it is time for\npeople to take extra ordinary preventive measures to safeguard their\nchildren and themselves from the disease. In case water is accumulated inside home due to heavy rainfall and\nflooded out of sewage lines, it must be wiped out immediately and the\nspace should be washed with clean water as soon as possible to avoid\ninfections. Avoiding inundation of contaminated water inside homes is\na must to avoid cholera and other infections, said Professor Tariq.

NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in\npress): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons,\nvaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside\nof Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as\n60-80 percent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection\nlengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are: - Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit.

A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam; - Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however,\nhave suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be\neffective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and\noutbreak situations (63, 64). \"References\n-\n57.

Malaria is a life-threatening mosquitoborne blood disease caused by a plasmodium parasite, which is usually transmitted to humans through the bite of the anopheles mosquito. Once an infected mosquito bites a human, the parasites multiply in the host's liver before infecting and destroying red blood cells.  According to the senior health official, the country's Epidemic Task Force, headed by the Ministry of Health in partnership with United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and other partners has also stepped up efforts to fight the disease.  The health official, however, decried the lack of funds to fight malaria and appealed for donations to help fight the disease.

However, the civil war in the country probably means that malaria control activities and probably drug distribution have been impaired, which could be one explanation for the reported outbreak. - Mod.EP  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/8402).

Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as\n60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection\nlengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:\n- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam;\n- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness\nand disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE,\nAtay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral\nrehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and\nother forms of diarrhea: \"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that\ncholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement,\nand, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not\nuntil 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of\nthe intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could\nbe effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the\nintravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could\nbe just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for\nexample, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy\n(ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the\nmorbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1)\nhighlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn\nBangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per\ncent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as\n\"potentially the most important medical advance\" of the 20th century.\nA variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice\npowder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially\nzinc (5). \"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to\napproximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those\nwith severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously\nwith a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of\n20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg\nover the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser\ndegrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or\nrice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those\nwith no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with\nfrequent reevaluation. \"References\n-\n1.

According to the Health ministry, the\nofficers are said to have been infected after taking meals at the\nNairobi Area Police Canteen. On Sun 3 Sep 2017, some 59 officers were hospitalised in various\nhospitals in Nairobi with another 36 admitted Mon 4 Sep 2017, after\ncontracting the disease. They were part of a group of 430 officers\ndeployed to Nairobi ahead of the Supreme Court ruling on presidential\npoll petition on Fri 1 Sep 2017. They were residing at the\nMultimedia University Hotel in Rongai, about 17 kilometers 10.6 mi\nsouth of the capital. \"Those infected did not get the disease from the Multimedia University\nsince they had their lunch away from the institution. Investigations\nshow that the source is the Nairobi Area Police Canteen,\" said Dr\nRalph Muli, the Nairobi County head of Diseases Surveillance.\nConsequently, the City has temporarily closed the canteen. The Health Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu said the officers were in\nstable condition. Dr Mailu said investigations were underway to\nestablish whether the canteen had outsourced services to cater for the\nlarge number of officers. He said the ministry was concerned that\ninstead of eliminating cholera, new cases were emerging. Nairobi was first hit by the outbreak on 19 May 2017, with 56 cases\nhaving been reported. One of the police officers who requested anonymity said they ate ugali\n(a Kenyan staple made of maize flour) and meat stew at the canteen on\nSat 2 Sep 2017.

Shipped from Amsterdam to Miami after participating in Sweden and UK  An American dressage horse returning to the United States after a competition tour in Europe could be euthanized or shipped back out of the country after testing positive for glanders during routine USDA equine import quarantine.  Glanders is a highly contagious upper respiratory disease that can be passed from horse-to-horse as well as to human handlers. Acute clinical signs include fever; cough; difficulty breathing; nasal discharge; swollen and painful submaxillary lymph nodes (the \"glands\" in \"glanders\"); rapidly spreading ulcers on the nasal mucosa, nodules, and chronic abscesses; and small abscesses in the lung and/or abscesses in the liver or spleen, among others. Clinical signs of chronic glanders include coughing; malaise; weight loss; intermittent fever; possible thick nasal discharge, usually out of one nostril; ulcers and nodules on the nasal mucosa; enlarged submaxillary lymph nodes; chronic enlargement and induration (hardening) of lymphatics and lymph nodes; joint swelling and painful leg edema (fluid swelling); and nodules, particularly on the legs, that rupture, release pus, and ulcerate. Glanders has been eradicated from North American and was last reported in the United States in the 1940s. It's recently been reported in several areas around the world, however, including South America, Eastern Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and a rare case in Germany in 2014.  Earlier this month August 2017, the 18-year-old Dutch Warmblood gelding Sagacious HF was shipped from Amsterdam to the Miami International Airport after participating in competitions in Sweden and England with Chase Hickok. Under USDA rules, all horses entering the United States, except those coming from Canada, must be quarantined and tested for 4 diseases  dourine, glanders, equine piroplasmosis, and equine infectious anemia  upon arrival.  Jeanine Neskey, interim public affairs specialist for the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), said an animal that produces a positive test result is denied entry to the United States.  \"Denied entry means that it must be either removed from the U.S. or be euthanized,\" she said. \"If the horse is denied entry into the U.S. (and not euthanized), the owner is free to take the horse to any other country that will accept it.\"  Scott Leibsle, DVM, Idaho's deputy state veterinarian, said Sagacious could have contracted the disease through contaminated feed or through water buckets also used by other horses participating in competitions. The gelding might also have been an asymptomatic carrier of the disease, possibly developing signs after experiencing stress  \"Transport is the most stressful thing you can do to a horse,\" he said. \"At the same time, you're putting it with new animals in a new area, and putting it under the stress of competition.\"  Currently APHIS uses a complement fixation test (CFT) to detect glanders. However, the agency is evaluating other testing methods, including the Western Blot procedure.  \"Advancing research and improved technology continue to develop new or improved testing methods for animal diseases,\" Neskey said. \"USDA routinely evaluates all testing methods available and incorporates the methods most appropriate to the needs of import quarantine testing.\"  After Sagacious produced a 2nd positive CFT glanders test, he produced a negative Western Blot glanders test. Arrangements were made to place him on extended quarantine pending the results of additional testing with both tests, slated for Wed 23 Aug 2017.  Byline: Pat Raia   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  Glanders, also known as farcy, is a contagious infectious disease of equines, acute or chronic, usually fatal, caused by the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_, and characterized by the development of ulcerated nodules that are most commonly found in the upper airway, lungs ,and skin. Felines and other animals are susceptible to infection, which is usually fatal. Humans can be infected and the microorganism (_B. mallei_) is considered a potential bioterrorism agent.  The disease, one among the oldest known and that used to be prevalent worldwide, is currently eradicated or effectively controlled in many countries. Recently the disease has been reported in some countries, including Iraq, Turkey, Pakistan, India, Mongolia, China, Brazil, United Arab Emirates, and countries in Africa. Glanders is one of the diseases contained in the list of diseases for mandatory reporting to the World Animal Health Organization (OIE).  The bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_ a clonal pathogen, can be found in nasal secretions and skin ulcers of infected animals. The transmission of glanders occurs commonly from intake of water or food contaminated with nasal secretions and exudates eliminated from infected animals, contact with contaminated equipment (saddles, harness) and by eating contaminated equine meat.  In the nasal form, nodules arise in septum and turbinates. Nodules progress to irregular edged ulcers; star-shaped scars are characteristic after the resolution of the ulcers. In the early stage, submandibular lymph nodes are enlarged and edematous, adhering to the skin and deep tissues in advanced stages of the disease. In the pulmonary form, inflammatory nodules with caseous or calcified centers are found in the lungs. With the progression of the disease areas of consolidation and pneumonia may be present. The nodules may break and eliminate the inflammatory content into the bronchial tree, spreading the infection to the upper respiratory tract. In the cutaneous form, nodules arise along the lymphatic vessels, especially on the extremities. The nodules may degenerate to form ulcers with drainage of highly infectious purulent material. The liver and spleen may have typical nodular lesions. Histologically, vasculitis, thrombosis, inflammatory cell infiltration and degeneration can be seen.  A test based on complement fixation can also be used for screening, but the ELISA test, although more sensitive, is not being routinely used. PCR can be used for specific identification ((https://www.merckvetmanual.com/generalized-conditions/glanders/overview-of-glanders)).  There are no vaccines. Prevention and control depend on early detection and eliminating infected animals in addition to quarantine and complete disinfection. Treatment, administered only in endemic areas, which does not lead to microbiological cure, is the use of doxycycline, ceftazidime, gentamycin, or streptomycin. Sulfa drugs (including in combination with trimethoprim) seem to be effective in prevention and glanders treatment ((http://www.merckmanuals.com/vet/generalized_conditions/glanders/overview_of_glanders.html?qt=glanders&alt=sh#Diagnosis)).  For glanders-free countries, there are OIE recommendations on importing equines. An international veterinary certificate is required attesting that the animals showed no clinical signs of glanders and were kept in an exporting country free of the disease for at least 6 months prior to shipment ((http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/GLA-EN.pdf)). It appears foreign horse owners will not be able to comply, therefore will be unable to repatriate their show horses? Further information would be welcome.  OIE WAHID's latest information shows continuing glanders in Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais states in 2014 (red circles on map; zoom in), but there have been no immediate or continuing event reports for Brazil in 2015. The OIE report and map are available at (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=11974).  As a horse owner, this would be devastating. We certainly hope Sagacious test later this month August 2017 clears him of this disease. - Mod.TG  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/212).

Five districts in 3 governorates are now infected.  The total number of cVDPV2 cases is 33 (this includes the previously reported 29 cases from Mayadeen district, Deir ez-Zor governorate, and 1 case from Tell Abyad district, Raqqa governorate). All confirmed cases to date have had onset of paralysis before 11 Jul 2017.  Final lab results for an additional 9 poliovirus type-2 (PV2) isolates from Deir ez-Zor are pending.  Discussions around expanding the scope of the immunization response to include accessible areas of a Tadmour sub-district in Homs, bordering Deir ez-Zor , will be held in light of the confirmation of the cases in this area.  Raqqa governorate commenced its 1st immunization round on 12 Aug 2017 (Raqqa and Thawra districts) and 13 Aug 2017 (Tell Abyad district). The immunization round aims to reach 120 000 children under 5 years of age. Preliminary information suggests the rounds are reaching children in all 3 districts.  Preparations continue for the 2nd round in Deir ez-Zor governorate, scheduled for 19-23 Aug 2017. IPV inactivated polio vaccine for use in the 2nd rounds in Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa governorates has arrived in Damascus.  The total number of AFP acute flaccid paralysis cases detected in Deir ez-Zor governorate since the beginning of 2017 is 113 (83 from Mayadeen, 11 from Deir ez-Zor, and 19 from Boukamal districts). Raqqa governorate has reported 16 AFP cases (5 from Raqqa, 10 from Tell Abyad, and 1 from Thawra districts). Homs governorate has reported 26 AFP cases (11 from Homs city, 12 from Rastan, 1 from Tadmour, and 2 from Talkalakh districts).  The Eradication and Outbreak Management Group (EOMG) has approved the release of additional doses of IPV to cover high risk population groups in northwest Syria, Turkey, and Lebanon. Lebanon requested 144 000 doses and has begun to implement IPV campaigns across the country.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Unfortunately transmission of the cVDPV2 in Syria has continued. With each report, the date of onset of the most recent case shifts to a date approximately one month preceding the report, probably reflecting the time it takes from specimen collection to appropriate reference laboratory. We are fairly sure there will be an additional 9 cases confirmed from Deir ez-Zor, as the report above mentions that there are 9 poliovirus isolates pending typing (WPV vs cVDPV). The report also mentions a significant number of AFP cases identified in the 3 governorates, suggesting there may be more cases in the pipeline for confirmation. The control activities have been implemented during this week and will be implemented in additional areas next week week of 21 Aug 2017, so hopefully there will be interruption of transmission going forward.  The disturbing news in the situation report above, is that there is now involvement of 3 governorates. Deir ez-Zor, Raqqa, and now Homs. On a map of Syria showing provinces/governorates ((http://www.freeworldmaps.net/asia/syria/syria-political-map.jpg)), one can see that Deir ez-Zor, the main governorate involved in this outbreak is located in the northeast of the country sharing it's eastern border with Iraq. It shares a southern border with Homs, and a western border with Raqqa (Ar-Raqqah on this map) governorate. Hopefully the cVDPV2 will not continue to travel in the country outside of the currently 3 affected areas. - Mod.MPP   <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Somalia: declared polio free. Date: Mon 14 Aug 2017. Source: AllAfrica, Shabelle Media Network (Mogadishu) report (edited) (http://allafrica.com/stories/201708150227.html)   The UN World Health Organisation (WHO) said it had not recorded any case of polio disease in Somalia in the last 3 years, declaring the country polio free.  The WHO said the country recorded the last case of polio in 2014 in the central part of the country but has since then remained free of the paralyzing disease.  The UN health agency, however, warned Somalia remained vulnerable, calling for continued vaccination campaign, Xinhua News Agency reported.  The head of the WHO Eastern Mediterranean, which covers Somalia, Mohamed Fiqi said that massive vaccination campaigns and commitment from government and international actors had ensured the polio virus did not recur in the Horn of Africa country.  \"As the world edges closer to eradicating polio, keeping alert in countries that have high risk of polio importation like Somalia is more of priority than ever,\" Fiqi said.  \"As we move forward, the polio programme in Somalia needs to continue to work to maintain and improve the level of population immunity against polio through target vaccination campaign and strengthening of the routine immunisation services and infrastructure,\" Fiqi added.  The declaration by WHO keeps Somalia outside the last group of countries which still record cases of polio in the world.  Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan are the remaining countries where polio is still being recorded. The WHO chief warned Somalia remains at risk of importation of the virus from these countries.  Somalia President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo praised efforts to rid his country of the polio disease which he noted had subjected many children into suffering.  \"No cases were found for the past 3 years and no child was affected by this disease. Many of our children have suffered from polio for many years.  \"To eradicate polio was a big success and it was collective effort and commitment by many young men and women who sacrificed their lives,\" Farmaajo noted.  The 3 year polio-free celebration comes amidst the worst outbreak of measles the country has seen in years.  Somalia is also still responding to an outbreak of acute watery diarrhoea/cholera, which began in January 2017. Polio systems and networks are being used in both interventions.  \"Polio infrastructure has been critical in responding to these other serious outbreaks,\" said Fiqi.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  Achieving 3 years with no new cases of polio reported is a significant achievement for Somalia. That being said, it's important to remember that this too is a country with internal civil strife and warring factions, which may impede the identification of poliovirus associated disease either due to infrastructural challenges in good specimen collection and transport, or access of the population to the healthcare infrastructure. A reminder is the identification of WPV associated cases in Borno, Nigeria last year (2016), involving a virus last seen 5 years before in the same state.

We continue to work together to advance shared priorities, including governance and democracy, regional security, poverty reduction, polio eradication, trade, defense, and the fight against climate change.\"  - The 14th Emergency Committee for polio eradication under the International Health Regulations met on 3 Aug 2017 and has made its recommendations to the WHO Director-General, who has accepted them. The Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and recommended the extension of revised Temporary Recommendations for a further 3 months. The key change is the inclusion of DR Congo and Syria in the category 'States infected with cVDPV2s, with potential risk of international spread'.  - Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: Afghanistan: 1 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case; Pakistan: 1 new WPV1-positive environmental sample; Syrian Arab Republic: 3 new circulating vaccine-derived polio type 2 (cVDPV2) from Syria, 2 from Deir ez-Zor and 1 from Homs governorates. Details in country-specific sections below.  Afghanistan  - One new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week, bringing the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 to 6. It is the most recent case in the country, and had onset of paralysis on 10 Jul 2017, from Zabul province, neighbouring Kandahar province and Pakistan. - Afghanistan continues to coordinate activities with neighbouring Pakistan, to address both cross-border transmission and focus on reaching mobile populations with oral polio vaccine (OPV). Transmission linking both countries runs primarily across 3 corridors, namely: eastern Afghanistan and Khyber-Peshawar, Pakistan; greater Kandahar/Helmand and Quetta, Pakistan; and, Paktika/Patkya/Khost and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa/Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Pakistan.  Pakistan  - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week; the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 3. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 11 Jun 2017, from Killa Abdullah, Balochistan. - 1 new WPV1-positive environmental sample was reported in the past week, collected on 28 Jul 2017, from Quetta, Balochistan. - A special vaccination round is being implemented during August 2017 targeting areas with recent polio cases and positive environmental samples. These include Rawalpindi/Islamabad and demographically connected areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Quetta Block, and parts of Karachi. - Under the National Emergency Action Plan for polio eradication, the country is planning to implement 2 nation-wide and 2 sub-national vaccination rounds from September to December 2017.  Nigeria - - No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 21 Aug 2016 in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno. - Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016). - Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance.  Lake Chad Basin  - The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno, Nigeria in 2016) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) (Borno and Sokoto provinces in Nigeria in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak. - Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.  Central Africa  - No new cases of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). The total number of cVDPV2 cases this year 2017 remains 7, in 2 separate outbreaks: in Haut Lomami province (5 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on 13 Jun 2017); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on 26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017, with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May 2017). - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time. Outbreak response is taking place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols, targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 across the 2 provinces. - The 1st mOPV2 round was implemented on 27-29 Jun 2017 in the 2 affected provinces; and the 2nd mOPV2 round ran from 13-15 Jul 2017 in Haut Lomami and 20-22 Jul 2017 in Maniema. - Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.  Middle East  - In Syria, 3 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were officially reported in the past week. The total number of cases in this outbreak is 33. Onset of paralysis of these cases is between 3 Mar 2017 and 10 Jul 2017. 31 of the cases are from Deir ez-Zor governorate (29 from Mayadeen district, one from Deir ez-Zor district, and one from Boukamal district); 1 case is from Talabyad district, Raqqa governorate; and, 1 is from Tadmour district in Homs governorate. - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized and implemented, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Two vaccination campaigns are planned for both Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa governorates. If there is geographic spread, the extent of these campaigns will have to be adjusted. - The 1st mOPV2 round in Deir ez-Zor was successfully carried out between 22-26 Jul 2017. Independent post-campaign monitoring reflected coverage of 88.4 percent (based on caregiver recall). The 2nd round is planned for 19-23 Aug 2017, and will include mOPV2 and IPV. - Raqqa Governorate started mOPV2 campaigns on 12 Aug 2017. - Plans are being finalized to mitigate the risks of further spread from the outbreak zone to neighbouring areas and countries, including immunization of at-risk populations in northwest Syria, Turkey and Lebanon. Following confirmation of the case in Homs, discussions are ongoing to further extend the geographic reach of the outbreak response.

(promed@promedmail.org)  This week's global update is similar to prior weeks in terms of low level identification of WPV1 associated disease (a single case confirmed in Afghanistan this past week), one positive WPV1 isolated from an environmental sample in Pakistan, and 3 newly confirmed cVDPV2 associated cases in Syria.  That being said, there have only been 9 confirmed cases of WPV1 associated paralytic disease worldwide this year (2017), compared with 37 cases reported last year (2016). In contrast there have been 40 confirmed cases of cVDPV2 confirmed this year (2017) compared with 5 last year (2016). As a reminder, outbreaks due to cVDPV's are considered as significant in the big picture of polio eradication, as they are due to vaccine polioviruses that have reverted in neurovirulence following passage through multiple individuals while circulating in the susceptible population. The goal of the polio eradication initiative is to interrupt transmission of both the WPV's and the cVDPVs. The presence of cVDPVs occurs when there are areas with low vaccination coverage where the vaccine virus (from the OPV) can continue circulating through the susceptible population.

The total number of cVDPV2 cases this year 2017 is now 8, in 2 separate outbreaks: in Haut Lomami province (6 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on 20 Jun 2017); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on 26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017, with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May 2017). - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time. Outbreak response is taking place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols, targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 across the 2 provinces. \n- The 1st mOPV2 round was implemented on 27-29 Jun 2017 in the 2 affected provinces; and the 2nd mOPV2 round ran from 13-15 Jul 2017 in Haut Lomami and 20-22 Jul 2017 in Maniema. - Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.  Middle East  - In Syria, 6 new cases of cVDPV2 were officially reported in the past week from Deir-Ez-Zour governorate, bringing the total number of cases in this outbreak to 39. Onset of paralysis of these cases is between 3 Mar 2017 and 10 Jul 2017. The bulk of all cases are from Deir-Ez-Zour, the epicentre of this outbreak. - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized and implemented, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Two vaccination campaigns are planned for both Deir-Ez-Zour and Raqqa governorates. - The 1st mOPV2 round in Deir-Ez-Zour was successfully carried out between 22-26 Jul 2017. Independent post-campaign monitoring reflected coverage of 88.4 percent (based on caregiver recall). - The 2nd immunization round for Deir-Ez-Zor governorate started on 22 Aug 2017 and is ongoing. Monovalent OPV2 is being provided for children between 0-59 months of age, and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) for children 2-23 months. In addition to polio vaccines, Aqua Tabs are being provided to families for water purification - 2.5 tons of water purification tablets for 400 000 people have been disseminated at health centers. - Plans are being finalized to mitigate the risks of further spread from the outbreak zone to neighbouring areas and countries, including immunization of at-risk populations in northwest Syria, Turkey and Lebanon.

All confirmed cases to date have had onset of paralysis before 14 Jul 2017. - Final lab results are pending for an additional 5 poliovirus type-2 (PV2) isolates (3 from Mayadeen and 1 from Boukamal districts, Deir Ez-Zor governorate, and 1 from Thawra district, Raqqa governorate). - The 2nd immunization round for Deir Ez-Zor started on 22 Aug 2017 and is ongoing due to high levels of population movement in and out of the governorate during the round. - WHO has organized the redistribution of vaccines and mapping of population movements to increase reach. An additional 90 000 mOPV2 doses are being transported from Damascus to Deir Ez-Zor, to cater for population influxes from As-Sukhnah, Homs governorate, and Al-Qa'im in Iraq. Corrective measures are expected to extend the round by 2 days. - Preparations for the 2nd immunization round for Raqqa are underway. - The total number of AFP cases detected in Deir Ez-Zor governorate since the beginning of 2017 is 122 (91 from Mayadeen, 10 from Deir Ez-Zor, and 21 from Boukamal districts). Raqqa governorate has reported 16 AFP cases (5 from Raqqa, 10 from Tell Abyad, and 1 from Thawra districts). Homs governorate has reported 28 AFP cases (12 from Homs city, 13 from Rastan, 1 from Tadmour and 2 from Talkalakh districts).  more details on the vaccination activities and future plans are available at the source URL as well as the epidemic curve and graphic representation of the vaccination status of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis cases by governorate and district. - Mod.MPP   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  In the above global summary, there is still identified transmission ongoing in Pakistan as seen by the positive environmental sample in Karachi as well as the early report on a case of WPV1 associated disease in Karachi. It will be interesting to learn of the genetic profile of the environmental isolates in Karachi (from this past week as well as from a few weeks ago) and compare them with the newly identified WPV1 associated case in Karachi to see if they are genetically related.  There has been more activity associated with cVDPV2 in both Syria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), with 6 newly confirmed cases in Syria and 1 newly confirmed case in the DR Congo. According to the Situation Report in section <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> above, there are still 5 additional PV2 (poliovirus type 2) isolates in Syria undergoing final testing  4 from Deir al Zour and 1 from Raqqa. Hence there will probably be more cases confirmed in the coming days or weeks. I have not been able to identify similar report information from the DR Congo outbreak so it is not clear if the transmission has been interrupted leaving a total of 8 cases, or if there are still probable cases pending confirmation.

Update: Interim guidance\nfor health care providers caring for pregnant women with possible Zika\nvirus exposure  United States (including US Territories), July 2017.\nMMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2017; 66(29): 781-93. doi:\n10.15585/mmwr.mm6629e1\n-\nCDC has updated the interim guidance for US health care providers\ncaring for pregnant women with possible Zika virus exposure in\nresponse to 1) declining prevalence of Zika virus disease in the World\nHealth Organization's Region of the Americas (Americas) and 2)\nemerging evidence indicating prolonged detection of Zika virus\nimmunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies. Zika virus cases were 1st reported\nin the Americas during 2015-2016; however, the incidence of Zika virus\ndisease has since declined. As the prevalence of Zika virus disease\ndeclines, the likelihood of false-positive test results increases. In\naddition, emerging epidemiologic and laboratory data indicate that, as\nis the case with other flaviviruses, Zika virus IgM antibodies can\npersist beyond 12 weeks after infection. Therefore, IgM test results\ncannot always reliably distinguish between an infection that occurred\nduring the current pregnancy and one that occurred before the current\npregnancy, particularly for women with possible Zika virus exposure\nbefore the current pregnancy. These limitations should be considered\nwhen counseling pregnant women about the risks and benefits of testing\nfor Zika virus infection during pregnancy. This updated guidance\nemphasizes a shared decision-making model for testing and screening\npregnant women, one in which patients and providers work together to\nmake decisions about testing and care plans based on patient\npreferences and values, clinical judgment, and a balanced assessment\nof risks and expected outcomes. For these recommendations, the definition of possible Zika virus\nexposure has not changed and includes travel to, or residence in an\narea with risk for mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission or sex with\na partner who has traveled to or resides in an area with risk for\nmosquito-borne Zika virus transmission. These areas can be found on\nthe CDC \"Zika Travel Information\" webpage. Key recommendations include the following:\n1- All pregnant women in the United States and US territories should\nbe asked about possible Zika virus exposure before and during the\ncurrent pregnancy, at every prenatal care visit. CDC recommends that\npregnant women not travel to any area with risk for Zika virus\ntransmission. It is also recommended that pregnant women with a sex\npartner who has traveled to or lives in an area with risk for Zika\nvirus transmission use condoms or abstain from sex for the duration of\nthe pregnancy.\n2- Pregnant women with recent possible Zika virus exposure and\nsymptoms of Zika virus disease should be tested to diagnose the cause\nof their symptoms. The updated recommendations include concurrent Zika\nvirus nucleic acid test (NAT) and serologic testing as soon as\npossible through 12 weeks after symptom onset.\n3- Asymptomatic pregnant women with ongoing possible Zika virus\nexposure should be offered Zika virus NAT testing 3 times during\npregnancy. IgM testing is no longer routinely recommended because IgM\ncan persist for months after infection; therefore, IgM results cannot\nreliably determine whether an infection occurred during the current\npregnancy. The optimal timing and frequency of testing of asymptomatic\npregnant women with NAT alone is unknown. For pregnant women who have\nreceived a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection (by\neither NAT or serology positive/equivocal Zika virus or dengue virus\nIgM and Zika virus plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) 10 and\nhigher and dengue virus PRNT less than 10 results) any time before or\nduring the current pregnancy, additional Zika virus testing is not\nrecommended. For pregnant women without a prior laboratory-confirmed\ndiagnosis of Zika virus, NAT testing should be offered at the\ninitiation of prenatal care, and if Zika virus RNA is not detected on\nclinical specimens, 2 additional tests should be offered during the\ncourse of the pregnancy coinciding with prenatal visits.\n4- Asymptomatic pregnant women who have recent possible Zika virus\nexposure (that is, through travel or sexual exposure) but without\nongoing possible exposure are not routinely recommended to have Zika\nvirus testing. Testing should be considered using a shared\npatient-provider decision-making model, one in which patients and\nproviders work together to make decisions about testing and care plans\nbased on patient preferences and values, clinical judgment, a balanced\nassessment of risks and expected outcomes, and the jurisdiction's\nrecommendations. Based on the epidemiology of Zika virus transmission\nand other epidemiologic considerations (such as, seasonality),\njurisdictions might recommend testing of asymptomatic pregnant women,\neither for clinical care or as part of Zika virus surveillance. With\nthe decline in the prevalence of Zika virus disease, the updated\nrecommendations for the evaluation and testing of pregnant women with\nrecent possible Zika virus exposure but without ongoing possible\nexposure are now the same for all areas with any risk for Zika virus\ntransmission.\n5- Pregnant women who have recent possible Zika virus exposure and who\nhave a fetus with prenatal ultrasound findings consistent with\ncongenital Zika virus syndrome should receive Zika virus testing to\nassist in establishing the etiology of the birth defects. Testing\nshould include both NAT and IgM tests.\n6- The comprehensive approach to testing placental and fetal tissues\nhas been updated. Testing placental and fetal tissue specimens can be\nperformed for diagnostic purposes in certain scenarios (e.g., women\nwithout a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection and\nwho have a fetus or infant with possible Zika virus-associated birth\ndefects). However, testing of placental tissues for Zika virus\ninfection is not routinely recommended for asymptomatic pregnant women\nwho have recent possible Zika virus exposure but without ongoing\npossible exposure and who have a live born infant without evidence of\npossible Zika virus-associated birth defects.\n7- Zika virus IgM testing as part of preconception counseling to\nestablish baseline IgM results for non pregnant women with ongoing\npossible Zika virus exposure is not warranted because Zika virus IgM\ntesting is no longer routinely recommended for asymptomatic pregnant\nwomen with ongoing possible Zika virus exposure. also at the source URL above:\nAdditional interim guidance:\n- Laboratory testing of pregnant women with exposure to areas with\nrisk for Zika virus transmission\n- Prenatal management of pregnant women with laboratory evidence of\npossible Zika virus infection\n- Evaluation of placental and fetal tissue specimens for Zika virus\ninfection \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org)\nand\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be)(promed@promedmail.org) Readers interested in accessing the full report can find it at the\nsource URL above.

To evaluate the rates of acute ZIKV infection among\npatients hospitalized with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS),\nmeningoencephalitis, or transverse myelitis.\nDesign, setting, and participants. A prospective, observational cohort\nstudy was conducted at a tertiary referral center for neurological\ndiseases in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between 5 Dec 2015-10 May 2016,\namong consecutive hospitalized adults (older than 18 years of age)\nwith new-onset acute parainfectious or neuroinflammatory disease. All\nparticipants were tested for a series of arbovirosis. 3-month\nfunctional outcome was assessed.\nInterventions. Samples of serum and cerebrospinal fluid were tested\nfor ZIKV using real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain\nreaction and an IgM antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent\nassay. Clinical, radiographic (magnetic resonance imaging),\nelectrophysiological, and 3-month functional outcome data were\ncollected.\nMain outcomes and measures. The detection of neurologic complications\nsecondary to ZIKV infection.\nResults. 40 patients (15 women and 25 men; median age, 44 years\nrange, 22-72 years) were enrolled, including 29 patients (73\npercent) with GBS (90 percent Brighton level 1 certainty), 7 (18\npercent) with encephalitis, 3 (8 percent) with transverse myelitis,\nand 1 (3 percent) with newly diagnosed chronic inflammatory\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy. Of these, 35 patients (88 percent) had\nmolecular and/or serologic evidence of recent ZIKV infection in the\nserum and/or cerebrospinal fluid. Of the patients positive for ZIKV\ninfection, 27 had GBS (18 demyelinating, 8 axonal, and 1 Miller Fisher\nsyndrome), 5 had encephalitis (3 with concomitant acute neuromuscular\ndisease), 2 had transverse myelitis, and 1 had chronic inflammatory\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy. Admission to the intensive care unit was\nrequired for 9 patients positive for ZIKV infection (26 percent), and\n5 (14 percent) required mechanical ventilation. Compared with\nadmission during the period from 5 Dec 2013 - 10 May 2014 (before the\nBrazilian outbreak of ZIKV), admissions for GBS increased from a mean\nof 1.0 per month to 5.6 per month, admissions for encephalitis\nincreased from 0.4 per month to 1.4 per month, and admissions for\ntransverse myelitis remained constant at 0.6 per month. At 3 months, 2\npatients positive for ZIKV infection (6 percent) died (1 with GBS and\n1 with encephalitis), 18 (51 percent) had chronic pain, and the median\nmodified Rankin score among survivors was 2 (range, 0-5).\nConclusions and relevance. In this single-center Brazilian cohort,\nZIKV infection was associated with an increase in the incidence of a\ndiverse spectrum of serious neurologic syndromes. The data also\nsuggest that serologic and molecular testing using blood and\ncerebrospinal fluid samples can serve as a less expensive, alternative\ndiagnostic strategy in developing countries, where plaque reduction\nneutralization testing is impractical. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) This study illustrates the need to consider post-Zika virus infection\nas a cause of a variety of neurological diseases.

PLoS\nPathog. 2017; 13(8): e1006487. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006487\n-\nAbstract\n\nStudies have demonstrated cross-reactivity of anti-dengue virus (DENV)\nantibodies in human sera against Zika virus (ZIKV), promoting\nincreased ZIKV infection in vitro. However, the correlation between in\nvitro and in vivo findings is not well characterized. Thus, we\nevaluated the impact of heterotypic flavivirus immunity on ZIKV titers\nin biofluids of rhesus macaques. Animals previously infected (420 days\nor longer) with DENV2, DENV4, or yellow fever virus were compared to\nflavivirus-naïve animals following infection with a Brazilian ZIKV\nstrain. Sera from DENV-immune macaques demonstrated cross-reactivity\nwith ZIKV by antibody-binding and neutralization assays prior to ZIKV\ninfection, and promoted increased ZIKV infection in cell culture\nassays. Despite these findings, no significant differences between\nflavivirus-naïve and immune animals were observed in viral titers,\nneutralizing antibody levels, or immune cell kinetics following ZIKV\ninfection. These results indicate that prior infection with\nheterologous flaviviruses neither conferred protection nor increased\nobserved ZIKV titers in this non-human primate ZIKV infection model. Author summary\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne, emerging flavivirus. In\naddition to asymptomatic or mild febrile manifestations, ZIKV\ninfection in humans is associated with comparatively rare congenital\nand neurological abnormalities. Previous in vitro studies have\ndemonstrated cross-reactivity of antibodies derived from dengue virus\ninfections with ZIKV, as well as antibody-mediated enhancement of\ninfection in cell culture. Therefore, there is concern among\nvaccinologists and the public health community that the more severe\ndisease manifestations could result from prior immunity, either from\nnatural infection or vaccination, to antigenically-related\nflaviviruses (such as, dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis).\nIn this study, we evaluated the impact of prior immunity to dengue or\nyellow fever virus on ZIKV infection in a non-human primate model.\nAfter confirming that our immune cohorts were capable of\nrecapitulating the published in vitro observations of cross-reactivity\nand enhancement, we looked for alteration of viral titers in\nperipheral blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, and vaginal\nsecretions, as well as alterations in gross pathology, clinical\nparameters, and immune response, as compared to our flavivirus-naïve\ncohort. Importantly, no significant differences between\nflavivirus-naïve and primed animals were observed in viral titers or\nbiofluid distribution, neutralizing antibody levels, or immune cell\nkinetics following ZIKV infection. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org)\nand\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be)(promed@promedmail.org) Previous dengue infection, whether acquired naturally or antibody\nelicited by vaccines, has been a concern due to the possibility of\nantibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) with more severe disease. This\nconcern also relates to Zika virus antibody from vaccination for\nenhancement of dengue virus infections with resulting more severe\ndisease. The monkey studies reported above indicated that this may not\nbe a problem for Zika virus vaccinated individuals.

ZIKV is also transmitted by\nsexual contact, although the relative importance of sexual\ntransmission is unclear. To better understand the role of sexual\ntransmission in ZIKV pathogenesis, a nonhuman primate (NHP) model of\nvaginal transmission was developed. ZIKV was readily transmitted to\nmature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by vaginal inoculation was\nreadily transmitted to mature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by\nvaginal individual RM with 1-5 vaginal inoculations required to\nestablish infection. After treatment with Depoprovera, a widely used\ncontraceptive progestin, 2 RM that initially resisted 8 vaginal ZIKV\ninoculations became infected after one ZIKV inoculation. Thus,\nDepoprovera seemed to enhance susceptibility to vaginal ZIKV\ntransmission. Unexpectedly, the kinetics of virus replication and\ndissemination after intravaginal ZIKV inoculation were markedly\ndifferent from RM infected with ZIKV by subcutaneous (SQ) virus\ninoculation. Several groups have reported that after SQ ZIKV\ninoculation vRNA is rapidly detected in blood plasma with vRNA less\ncommon in urine and saliva and only rarely detected in female\nreproductive tract (FRT) secretions. In contrast, in vaginally\ninoculated RM, plasma vRNA is delayed for several days and ZIKV\nreplication in, and vRNA shedding from, the FRT was found in all 6\nanimals. Further, after intravaginal transmission ZIKV RNA shedding\nfrom FRT secretions was detected before or simultaneously with plasma\nvRNA, and persisted for at least as long. Thus, ZIKV replication in\nthe FRT was independent of, and often preceded virus replication in\nthe tissues contributing to plasma vRNA. These results support the\nconclusion that ZIKV preferentially replicates in the FRT after\nvaginal transmission, but not after SQ transmission, and raise the\npossibility that there is enhanced fetal infection and pathology after\nvaginal ZIKV transmission compared to a mosquito transmitted ZIKV. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{10}</strong> _Aedes albopictus_ populations as vectors.\nDate: 2 Aug 2017.\nSource: American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (edited)\n(http://www.ajtmh.org/content/journals/10.4269/ajtmh.16-0969) \nref: Azar SR, Roundy CM, Rossi SL, et al.

Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2017; 97(2): 330-9;\ndoi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.16-0969\n-\nAbstract\n\nTo evaluate the potential role of _Aedes albopictus_ (Skuse) as a\nvector of Zika virus (ZIKV), colonized mosquitoes of low generation\nnumber (less than or F5) from Brazil, Houston, and the Rio Grande\nValley of Texas engorged on viremic mice infected with ZIKV strains\noriginating from Senegal, Cambodia, Mexico, Brazil, or Puerto Rico.\nVector competence was established by monitoring infection,\ndissemination, and transmission potential after 3, 7, and 14 days of\nextrinsic incubation. Positive saliva samples were assayed for\ninfectious titer. Although all 3 mosquito populations were susceptible\nto all ZIKV strains, rates of infection, dissemination, and\ntransmission differed among mosquito and virus strains. _Aedes\nalbopictus_ from Salvador, Brazil, were the least efficient vectors,\ndemonstrating susceptibility to infection to 2 American strains of\nZIKV but failing to shed virus in saliva. Mosquitoes from the Rio\nGrande Valley were the most efficient vectors and were capable of\nshedding all 3 tested ZIKV strains into saliva after 14 days of\nextrinsic incubation. In particular, ZIKV strain DakAR 41525 (Senegal\n1954) was significantly more efficient at dissemination and saliva\ndeposition than the others tested in Rio Grande mosquitoes. Overall,\nour data indicate that, while _Ae. albopictus_ is capable of\ntransmitting ZIKV, its competence is potentially dependent on\ngeographic origin of both the mosquito population and the viral\nstrain. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) This study illustrates that fact that not all Zika virus strains and\n_Ae. albopictus_ populations are created equal in terms of efficiency\nof transmission of this virus. Although some populations of this\nmosquito are able to efficiently transmits some Zika viruses, the fact\nthat _Ae. albopictus _ are not strictly human biters, further reduces\ntheir role as transmitters of this virus to people. - Mod.TY \n<br><br><strong>{11}</strong> _Culex quinquefasciatus_ as vectors.\nDate: Wed 9 Aug 2017.\nSource: Emerging Microbes & Infections (edited)\n(http://www.nature.com/emi/journal/v6/n8/full/emi201759a.html?foxtrotcallback=true) \nref: Guedes DR, Paiva MH, Donato MM, et al. Zika virus replication in\nthe mosquito _Culex quinquefasciatus_ in Brazil. Emerg Microbes\nInfect. 2017; 6(8): e69. doi: 10.1038/emi.2017.59\n-\nAbstract\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has recently been associated\nwith an increased incidence of neonatal microcephaly and other\nneurological disorders. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito\nbite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some\ncases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main\nvector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other\nmosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the\nvirus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit\nZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of\nlaboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_.\nInterestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the\nmidgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in\nRecife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially\nfed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced.\nCollectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range\nof ZIKV vectors than anticipated. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be) Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active\nvirus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their\nability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step\ntoward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_\nfed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in\nsaliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing.\nThe study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a\ncompetent vector. Several other studies have shown this species to be\ninefficient vectors or refractory to Zika virus infection. One wonders\nif the specific _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ used or the Zika virus isolates\nwith which they were tested could account for these very different\nresults. Resolving these discrepancies is important because this\nmosquito species is very widely distributed around the world and bears\ndirectly on risk of outbreaks in geographic areas where _Aedes\naegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_ , Zika virus vectors, do not occur. -\nMod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"72":{"title":"Chikungunya (27) - Americas, Europe, Asia ","date":["18","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Chikungunya (27) - Americas, Europe, Asia [EXTERNAL]","summary":"\nCHIKUNGUNYA (27) - AMERICAS, EUROPE, ASIA\n*\nA ProMED-mail post\n(http://www.promedmail.org)\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n(http://www.isid.org) In this update:\nCases in various countries:\nRegional summaries\n\nAmericas\n\nRegional summary\nWHO/PAHO report Mexico and Central America\n\nMexico (Jalisco state)\nCosta Rica South America\n\nArgentina (Salto province)\nBrazil:\n- Roraima state\n- Ceara state\nPeru (Piura region) Europe\n\nFrance (Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region in Provence) Asia\n\nTaiwan (Tainan)\nIndia:\n- Delhi\n- Ludhiana, Punjab\n- Chandigarh, Haryana and Punjab states\n- Tamil Nadu state\n- Baramati tehsil, Pune, Maharastra state\n- Pune Maharashtra state ex Assam state\n- Kerala state\nBangladesh (Dhaka)\nNepal (Bhaktapur, province 3) \nCases in various countries:\nRegional summaries\n\nAmericas\n\nWHO/PAHO report\n18 Aug 2017\n(http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_topics&view=rdmore&cid=8975&Itemid=40931&lang=en) \nReported cases of chikungunya fever in the Americas, by country or\nterritory - 2017 to EW 33 week ending 18 Aug 2017.

Given the\noutbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections in the region, and the\nclinical similarity of cases of that virus infection and CHIKV\ninfection, one wonders how many cases that were not laboratory\nconfirmed but clinically diagnosed as ZIKV infections were, in\nreality, CHIKV infections. It is also possible that a significant\nproportion of the population have been infected by CHIKV in the\nprevious 3 years and are now immune. It seems likely, however, that\nCHIKV is now endemic in the Americas, and sporadic, small outbreaks\nmay continue to occur as they do in Asia and Africa. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"115":{"title":"Dengue/DHF update (10): Asia, Pacific, Africa, research, WHO\r\n\t","date":["25","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Dengue/DHF update (10): Asia, Pacific, Africa, research, WHO\r\n\t[EXTERNAL]","summary":"\nDENGUE/DHF UPDATE (10): ASIA, PACIFIC, AFRICA, RESEARCH, WHO\n\nA ProMED-mail post\n(http://www.promedmail.org)\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n(http://www.isid.org) In this update:\n<br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Cases in various countries Asia\n\nSri Lanka\n- National\n- National\n- National\nIndia\n- National\n- Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Assam\n- Delhi\n- Tamil Nadu (Coimbatore)\n- Tamil Nadu\n- Tamil Nadu (Chennai)\n- Tamil Nadu (Chennai)\n- Kerala\n- Karnataka\n- Karnataka (Gulbarga)\n- Karnataka (Gulbarga)\n- West Bengal (Kolkata)\n- West Bengal (Birbhum)\n- West Bengal (Siliguri)\n- Odisha (Ganjam)\n- Odisha\n- Gujarat (Ahmedabad)\n- Jharkhand (Jamshedpur)\n- Telangana (Hyderabad)\nPakistan\n- Sindh (Karachi)\n- Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (Peshawar)\n- Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (Peshawar)\n- Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (Peshawar)\nChina\n- Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region ex Viet Nam (susp)\n- Hong Kong SAR\n- Macau SAR\n- Macau SAR\nTaiwan\nMyanmar\n- National\n- Kayah\nIndonesia\n- Papua (Jayapura)\nViet Nam\n- National\n- National\n- Mekong Delta\n- Hanoi\n- Ha Nam\nPhilippines\n- National\n- Cebu\n- Negros Occidental\n- Negros Occidental (Bacolod City)\n- Cavite (Trece Martires City)\nLaos\n- National\nJapan ex Côte d'Ivoire Pacific\n\n- Samoa\n- Samoa\n- Samoa\n- Samoa\n- Fiji\n- French Polynesia (Tahiti) Africa\n\n- Côte d'Ivoire\n- Côte d'Ivoire <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Research\n- Viral persistence\n- Air travel related spread of dengue\n- Visual impact <br><br><strong>{3}</strong> World Health Organization update \n<br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Cases in various countries\nAsia\n\nSri Lanka\n- National. 26 Jul 2017.

All 4 dengue serotypes are\npresent this year 2017. A total of 15 samples found to be\nco-infected. In an earlier study done in New Delhi, such multiple\ndengue serotype infections were reported in only 19 per cent of cases.\nAll 4 dengue serotypes were detected in almost equal number in blood\nsamples, unlike in an earlier study conducted in New Delhi wherein one\nserotype was found to be dominating. This has been indicated as a\npossible reason for the high prevalence of infection due to more than\none dengue serotype. Another finding of concern is that DEN-4 strain,\nresembling the one detected in Pune in 2009, was detected in as many\nas 11 samples. DEN-4 is associated with unusual symptoms like\nrespiratory distress, pleural effusion, and elevated levels of liver\nenzymes. Also, detection of a DEN-1 strain found closely related to a\nstrain from Thailand detected in 1980 that causes high severity\ninfection has been reported. Dr Musturi Venkataramana, assistant\nprofessor of biotechnology of UoH, who led the study, said, \"When a\nperson is infected with more than one serotype of dengue, it may lead\nto dengue haemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome which can cause\nsevere health problems, and even death.

This came about after 2\nkidney recipients in Taiwan were diagnosed with dengue 2 days after\nreceiving a kidney each from the same donor, said National Cheng Kung\nUniversity microbiology and immunology professor Dr Oscar Perng\nGuey-chuen. \"This indicates a potential risk,\" the Taiwan-based\nscientist said, adding that no dengue virus was detected in the\ndonor's blood. He said the donor contracted dengue in 2015 and in mid-2016, he died\nin an accident. His family donated his corneas, liver, heart, and\nkidneys. Both patients had the same strain of the dengue virus the\ndonor had in 2015 and one of the recipients died of dengue\nhaemorrhagic fever, he said. Asked where the virus could be hiding since it could not be detected\nin the blood, he said it was a question scientists are trying to\nanswer. Interestingly, those who received the donor's corneas, liver,\nand heart did not develop dengue, Dr Perng said on the sidelines of\nthe National Dengue And Arboviruses Infection Conference 2017\nyesterday 12 Aug 2017. He said although there was not enough\nevidence to show the virus came from the donor as the kidneys were not\ntested for dengue before the transplant, the same virus was found in\nthe patients' bodies after that. Dr Perng said his team had studied mice for dengue virus in the blood\ntestes, kidney, liver, spleen and brain, and found the virus present\nin the kidneys and brain. \"We believe the virus probably resided in\nthe kidneys and was not cleared by the body,\" he said, adding that the\nvirus could have been activated after transplant. He said this raised\nconcerns about asymptomatic people who are dengue carriers. Health Ministry deputy director, general Datuk Dr S Jeyaindran said\npatients with severe dengue would have better recovery if they were\ngiven colloids, a more concentrated fluid, at the early stage in fluid\nmanagement for dengue patients. Dr Jeyaindran, who was representing\nHealth Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam, said colloids may be\nintroduced at an earlier stage, instead of saline because it has not\nbeen successful in treating patients with severe dengue. He said more\nstudies will be conducted to find out at which stage the colloids\nshould be given. byline: Loh Foon Fong \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) - Air travel related spread of dengue.\nDate: Thu 3 Aug 2017.\nSource: Medical Xpress (edited)\n(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-08-air-responsible-dengue-asia.html) \nWhile the incidences of many other infectious diseases have declined\nover the past decade, the number of cases and outbreaks of dengue\nvirus have continued to increase. The spread of dengue to new areas is\nlikely due in large part to trends in air travel, researchers now\nreport in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Dengue virus affects as estimated 390 million people around the globe\neach year, and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild fever and\nheadache to severe low blood pressure. The virus has mostly caused\ndisease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, but a 2014\noutbreak in Japan broke that pattern. Overall, the geographic area\naffected by dengue has been growing in recent years. In the new work, Huaiyu Tian and Bing Xu, both of Beijing Normal\nUniversity, China, together with colleagues from the University of\nOxford and elsewhere analyzed the spread of dengue viruses in Asia\nfrom 1956 to 2015. They used 2202 genetic sequences of dengue viruses,\ncollected in 20 countries or regions of Asia over the 59 years, to\ndetermine how different strains were related. They also investigated\ntrends in air travel, maritime mobility, migration, and\nsocio-economics to determine what factors impact the spread of\ndengue. The spread of 3 different dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1, -2, and -3,\nis associated with air traffic more so than any other factors, the\ndata revealed. Air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India, the\nresearchers found, help seed dengue epidemics, while China, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, and Singapore help diffuse the virus to other Asian\ncountries. \"Future trends in global mobility could potentially accelerate the\nappearance and diffusion of DENV worldwide,\" the researchers say.\n\"Prevention and control of dengue epidemics requires a better\nunderstanding of its mode of geographic dissemination, especially for\ncountries in the tropics.\" Reference: Tian H, Sun Z, Faria NR, et al.

Ending the outbreak and preventing its spread beyond Tanzania's\nborders is a high priority for WHO. To that end, WHO and partners\nsupport a well-coordinated multisectoral response through the National\nCholera Task Force which plans, coordinates and support subnational\nauthorities. Indeed, learning requires a continuous assessment of performance, a\nreview of successes and failures and a robust support for improvement.\nAn After Action Review (AAR) is a simple methodology for facilitating\nthis assessment. It provides for a qualitative review of actions taken\nto respond to an emergency as a means of identifying best practices,\ngaps and lessons learned. As a component of the IHR Monitoring and\nEvaluation Framework (IHR MEF) and part of the preparedness and\nresponse cycle, an AAR seeks to identify what worked well or not and\nhow these practices can be maintained, improved, institutionalized and\nshared with relevant stakeholders.

The 1st 2 cases of\ncholera were tested positive by National Institute of Health Islamabad\non Mon 31 Jul 2017 and another 2 confirmed positive for the\ninfection on Fri 4 Aug 2017. All the 4 patients were undergoing\ntreatment at Benazir Bhutto Hospital BH where as many as 4 more\nsuspects of the infection have been admitted for treatment. Data collected by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017 reveals that the\nallied hospitals have sent stool samples of over 10 child patients to\nNIH for confirmation of cholera in last week week of Sun 6 Aug\n2017. On Sat 12 Aug 2017, as many as 20 child patients with severe\ndiarrhoea were admitted at the BBH of which 4 were suspected as\npatients of cholera and their stool samples were sent to NIH for\nconfirmation, said Associate Professor of Paediatrics at Rawalpindi\nMedical University Dr Tariq Saeed when contacted by 'The News' on Mon\n14 Aug 2017. He added the hospital has not received confirmation reports from the\nNIH because of holidays there from Saturday to Monday. However, we\nhave been keeping the suspects in isolation under strict monitoring,\nhe said. He added that repeated rainfalls in the region and water inundation\ninside and outside homes in a number of localities particularly in\nthickly populated areas of the city are causing contamination of water\nand foodstuff that increases chances of spread of a number of\ninfections among population while children are at greater risk of\ncontracting life-threatening infections including cholera. It is important that the transmission of cholera occurs primarily by\ndrinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the feces\n(waste product) of an infected person, including one with no apparent\nsymptoms. It is observed that heavy rainfall causes collection of heavily\ncontaminated water in streets and houses and the waste water flooding\nout of various nullahs watercourses including Nullah Leh in town\ncauses infections including cholera, typhoid, dysentery,\ngastroenteritis, hepatitis A and E, shigellosis and giardiasis. Professor Tariq said the consumption of contaminated water and\nfoodstuff causes cholera, an infection in the small intestine caused\nby bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. Its main symptoms are watery diarrhea\nand vomiting that can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte\nimbalance, and death in cases which are not treated in time, he said. Health experts say that to avoid cholera and other infections, one\nmust use boiled water for drinking and should use vegetables after\nwashing with clean water and it must be kept in mind that raw\nvegetables should not be eaten in the existing weather conditions\ninstead these should be used after cooking. To a query, Professor Tariq said the heavy rainfall and water\naccumulation may contaminate water at sources and there may be chances\nof contamination of water at tube wells so individuals must boil water\nbefore drinking to avoid cholera and other infections. He added the appearance of cholera is alarming and it is time for\npeople to take extra ordinary preventive measures to safeguard their\nchildren and themselves from the disease. In case water is accumulated inside home due to heavy rainfall and\nflooded out of sewage lines, it must be wiped out immediately and the\nspace should be washed with clean water as soon as possible to avoid\ninfections. Avoiding inundation of contaminated water inside homes is\na must to avoid cholera and other infections, said Professor Tariq.

NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in\npress): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons,\nvaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside\nof Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as\n60-80 percent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection\nlengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are: - Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 percent (95 percent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam; - Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however,\nhave suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be\neffective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and\noutbreak situations (63, 64). \"References\n-\n57.

On Sun 3 Sep 2017, some 59 officers were hospitalised in various\nhospitals in Nairobi with another 36 admitted Mon 4 Sep 2017, after\ncontracting the disease. They were part of a group of 430 officers\ndeployed to Nairobi ahead of the Supreme Court ruling on presidential\npoll petition on Fri 1 Sep 2017. They were residing at the\nMultimedia University Hotel in Rongai, about 17 kilometers 10.6 mi\nsouth of the capital. \"Those infected did not get the disease from the Multimedia University\nsince they had their lunch away from the institution. Investigations\nshow that the source is the Nairobi Area Police Canteen,\" said Dr\nRalph Muli, the Nairobi County head of Diseases Surveillance.\nConsequently, the City has temporarily closed the canteen. The Health Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu said the officers were in\nstable condition. Dr Mailu said investigations were underway to\nestablish whether the canteen had outsourced services to cater for the\nlarge number of officers. He said the ministry was concerned that\ninstead of eliminating cholera, new cases were emerging. Nairobi was first hit by the outbreak on 19 May 2017, with 56 cases\nhaving been reported. One of the police officers who requested anonymity said they ate ugali\n(a Kenyan staple made of maize flour) and meat stew at the canteen on\nSat 2 Sep 2017. He said he started feeling sick in the evening.

According to Oscar Endekwa, the County Director for Public\nHealth, 21 cholera cases have been reported in the county. Speaking to Nation in his office in Hola, Dr Endekwa said the\nsituation at the NYS camp was under control. \"The officers are\nresponding well to treatment. The other case is of a resident and he\nhas been placed under treatment,\" he said. He added that the symptoms\nwere noted on August 30, though they had not been confirmed, adding\nthat health officials are investigating the cause of the disease. Besides isolating victims, Dr Endekwa said the county is also\nsensitizing residents on hygiene and sanitation. \"We are trying to\ncombat it before it spreads to a larger population,\" he added.

The\nfollowing is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In:\nChronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract.\nGreydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in\npress): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons,\nvaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside\nof Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as\n60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection\nlengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:\n- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam;\n- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however,\nhave suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be\neffective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and\noutbreak situations (63, 64). \"References\n\n57.

Here we evaluate the risk of Zika virus transmission through\nmucosal contact in rhesus macaques. Application of high-dose Zika\nvirus directly to the tonsils of 3 rhesus macaques results in\ndetectable plasma viremia in all animals by 2 days post-exposure;\nvirus replication kinetics are similar to those observed in animals\ninfected subcutaneously. 3 additional macaques inoculated\nsubcutaneously with Zika virus served as saliva donors to assess the\ntransmission risk from contact with oral secretions from an infected\nindividual. 7 naive animals repeatedly exposed to donor saliva via the\nconjunctivae, tonsils, or nostrils did not become infected. Our\nresults suggest that there is a risk of Zika virus transmission via\nthe mucosal route, but that the risk posed by oral secretions from\nindividuals with a typical course of Zika virus infection is low. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall It is good to learn that Zika virus transmission via mucosa is\nunlikely.

Update: Interim guidance\nfor health care providers caring for pregnant women with possible Zika\nvirus exposure  United States (including US Territories), July 2017.\nMMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2017; 66(29): 781-93. doi:\n10.15585/mmwr.mm6629e1\n-\nCDC has updated the interim guidance for US health care providers\ncaring for pregnant women with possible Zika virus exposure in\nresponse to 1) declining prevalence of Zika virus disease in the World\nHealth Organization's Region of the Americas (Americas) and 2)\nemerging evidence indicating prolonged detection of Zika virus\nimmunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies. Zika virus cases were 1st reported\nin the Americas during 2015-2016; however, the incidence of Zika virus\ndisease has since declined. As the prevalence of Zika virus disease\ndeclines, the likelihood of false-positive test results increases. In\naddition, emerging epidemiologic and laboratory data indicate that, as\nis the case with other flaviviruses, Zika virus IgM antibodies can\npersist beyond 12 weeks after infection. Therefore, IgM test results\ncannot always reliably distinguish between an infection that occurred\nduring the current pregnancy and one that occurred before the current\npregnancy, particularly for women with possible Zika virus exposure\nbefore the current pregnancy. These limitations should be considered\nwhen counseling pregnant women about the risks and benefits of testing\nfor Zika virus infection during pregnancy. This updated guidance\nemphasizes a shared decision-making model for testing and screening\npregnant women, one in which patients and providers work together to\nmake decisions about testing and care plans based on patient\npreferences and values, clinical judgment, and a balanced assessment\nof risks and expected outcomes. For these recommendations, the definition of possible Zika virus\nexposure has not changed and includes travel to, or residence in an\narea with risk for mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission or sex with\na partner who has traveled to or resides in an area with risk for\nmosquito-borne Zika virus transmission. These areas can be found on\nthe CDC \"Zika Travel Information\" webpage. Key recommendations include the following:\n1- All pregnant women in the United States and US territories should\nbe asked about possible Zika virus exposure before and during the\ncurrent pregnancy, at every prenatal care visit. CDC recommends that\npregnant women not travel to any area with risk for Zika virus\ntransmission. It is also recommended that pregnant women with a sex\npartner who has traveled to or lives in an area with risk for Zika\nvirus transmission use condoms or abstain from sex for the duration of\nthe pregnancy.\n2- Pregnant women with recent possible Zika virus exposure and\nsymptoms of Zika virus disease should be tested to diagnose the cause\nof their symptoms. The updated recommendations include concurrent Zika\nvirus nucleic acid test (NAT) and serologic testing as soon as\npossible through 12 weeks after symptom onset.\n3- Asymptomatic pregnant women with ongoing possible Zika virus\nexposure should be offered Zika virus NAT testing 3 times during\npregnancy. IgM testing is no longer routinely recommended because IgM\ncan persist for months after infection; therefore, IgM results cannot\nreliably determine whether an infection occurred during the current\npregnancy. The optimal timing and frequency of testing of asymptomatic\npregnant women with NAT alone is unknown. For pregnant women who have\nreceived a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection (by\neither NAT or serology positive/equivocal Zika virus or dengue virus\nIgM and Zika virus plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) 10 and\nhigher and dengue virus PRNT less than 10 results) any time before or\nduring the current pregnancy, additional Zika virus testing is not\nrecommended. For pregnant women without a prior laboratory-confirmed\ndiagnosis of Zika virus, NAT testing should be offered at the\ninitiation of prenatal care, and if Zika virus RNA is not detected on\nclinical specimens, 2 additional tests should be offered during the\ncourse of the pregnancy coinciding with prenatal visits.\n4- Asymptomatic pregnant women who have recent possible Zika virus\nexposure (that is, through travel or sexual exposure) but without\nongoing possible exposure are not routinely recommended to have Zika\nvirus testing. Testing should be considered using a shared\npatient-provider decision-making model, one in which patients and\nproviders work together to make decisions about testing and care plans\nbased on patient preferences and values, clinical judgment, a balanced\nassessment of risks and expected outcomes, and the jurisdiction's\nrecommendations. Based on the epidemiology of Zika virus transmission\nand other epidemiologic considerations (such as, seasonality),\njurisdictions might recommend testing of asymptomatic pregnant women,\neither for clinical care or as part of Zika virus surveillance. With\nthe decline in the prevalence of Zika virus disease, the updated\nrecommendations for the evaluation and testing of pregnant women with\nrecent possible Zika virus exposure but without ongoing possible\nexposure are now the same for all areas with any risk for Zika virus\ntransmission.\n5- Pregnant women who have recent possible Zika virus exposure and who\nhave a fetus with prenatal ultrasound findings consistent with\ncongenital Zika virus syndrome should receive Zika virus testing to\nassist in establishing the etiology of the birth defects. Testing\nshould include both NAT and IgM tests.\n6- The comprehensive approach to testing placental and fetal tissues\nhas been updated. Testing placental and fetal tissue specimens can be\nperformed for diagnostic purposes in certain scenarios (e.g., women\nwithout a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection and\nwho have a fetus or infant with possible Zika virus-associated birth\ndefects). However, testing of placental tissues for Zika virus\ninfection is not routinely recommended for asymptomatic pregnant women\nwho have recent possible Zika virus exposure but without ongoing\npossible exposure and who have a live born infant without evidence of\npossible Zika virus-associated birth defects.\n7- Zika virus IgM testing as part of preconception counseling to\nestablish baseline IgM results for non pregnant women with ongoing\npossible Zika virus exposure is not warranted because Zika virus IgM\ntesting is no longer routinely recommended for asymptomatic pregnant\nwomen with ongoing possible Zika virus exposure. also at the source URL above:\nAdditional interim guidance:\n- Laboratory testing of pregnant women with exposure to areas with\nrisk for Zika virus transmission\n- Prenatal management of pregnant women with laboratory evidence of\npossible Zika virus infection\n- Evaluation of placental and fetal tissue specimens for Zika virus\ninfection \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org)\nand\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be)(promed@promedmail.org) Readers interested in accessing the full report can find it at the\nsource URL above.

What is the spectrum of neurologic manifestations in adults\nwith Zika virus infection?\nFindings. This cohort study evaluated adult patients with new-onset\nparainfectious or neuroinflammatory disease for the presence of acute\nZika virus infection in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples\nusing molecular and serological testing. An increase in the incidence\nof Guillain-Barré syndrome and encephalitis was observed compared\nwith the period before the outbreak of the Zika virus.\nMeaning The Zika virus may be associated with a rapid increase in the\nincidence of life-threatening neurologic syndromes; serologic and\nmolecular testing using blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples can\nserve as an alternative diagnostic strategy. Abstract\n\nImportance. There are no prospective cohort studies assessing the\nincidence and spectrum of neurologic manifestations secondary to Zika\nvirus (ZIKV) infection in adults.\nObjective. To evaluate the rates of acute ZIKV infection among\npatients hospitalized with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS),\nmeningoencephalitis, or transverse myelitis.\nDesign, setting, and participants. A prospective, observational cohort\nstudy was conducted at a tertiary referral center for neurological\ndiseases in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between 5 Dec 2015-10 May 2016,\namong consecutive hospitalized adults (older than 18 years of age)\nwith new-onset acute parainfectious or neuroinflammatory disease. All\nparticipants were tested for a series of arbovirosis. 3-month\nfunctional outcome was assessed.\nInterventions. Samples of serum and cerebrospinal fluid were tested\nfor ZIKV using real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain\nreaction and an IgM antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent\nassay. Clinical, radiographic (magnetic resonance imaging),\nelectrophysiological, and 3-month functional outcome data were\ncollected.\nMain outcomes and measures. The detection of neurologic complications\nsecondary to ZIKV infection.\nResults. 40 patients (15 women and 25 men; median age, 44 years\nrange, 22-72 years) were enrolled, including 29 patients (73\npercent) with GBS (90 percent Brighton level 1 certainty), 7 (18\npercent) with encephalitis, 3 (8 percent) with transverse myelitis,\nand 1 (3 percent) with newly diagnosed chronic inflammatory\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy. Of these, 35 patients (88 percent) had\nmolecular and/or serologic evidence of recent ZIKV infection in the\nserum and/or cerebrospinal fluid. Of the patients positive for ZIKV\ninfection, 27 had GBS (18 demyelinating, 8 axonal, and 1 Miller Fisher\nsyndrome), 5 had encephalitis (3 with concomitant acute neuromuscular\ndisease), 2 had transverse myelitis, and 1 had chronic inflammatory\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy. Admission to the intensive care unit was\nrequired for 9 patients positive for ZIKV infection (26 percent), and\n5 (14 percent) required mechanical ventilation. Compared with\nadmission during the period from 5 Dec 2013 - 10 May 2014 (before the\nBrazilian outbreak of ZIKV), admissions for GBS increased from a mean\nof 1.0 per month to 5.6 per month, admissions for encephalitis\nincreased from 0.4 per month to 1.4 per month, and admissions for\ntransverse myelitis remained constant at 0.6 per month. At 3 months, 2\npatients positive for ZIKV infection (6 percent) died (1 with GBS and\n1 with encephalitis), 18 (51 percent) had chronic pain, and the median\nmodified Rankin score among survivors was 2 (range, 0-5).\nConclusions and relevance. In this single-center Brazilian cohort,\nZIKV infection was associated with an increase in the incidence of a\ndiverse spectrum of serious neurologic syndromes. The data also\nsuggest that serologic and molecular testing using blood and\ncerebrospinal fluid samples can serve as a less expensive, alternative\ndiagnostic strategy in developing countries, where plaque reduction\nneutralization testing is impractical. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) This study illustrates the need to consider post-Zika virus infection\nas a cause of a variety of neurological diseases.

We found that ZIKV\npersistently infects brain endothelial cells that normally protect\nneurons from viral exposure. hBMECs are not damaged by ZIKV infection\nand, analogous to persistent HCV infection, ZIKV constitutively\ninduces and evades antiviral ISG IFN-stimulated genes and IFN\ninterferon responses to continuously replicate in hBMECs. As a\nresult, hBMECs provide a protective niche for systemic ZIKV spread and\na viral reservoir localized in the normally protective blood-brain\nbarrier. Consistent with the spread of ZIKV into neuronal\ncompartments, ZIKV was released basolaterally from hBMECs. Our\nfindings define hBMEC responses that contribute to persistent ZIKV\ninfection and potential targets for clearing ZIKV infections from\nhBMECs. These results further suggest roles for additional\nZIKV-infected ECs to facilitate viral spread and persistence in the\nprotected placental, retinal, and testicular compartments. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{7}</strong> Prior flavivirus infection and Zika virus infection.\nDate: Thu 3 Aug 2017.\nSource: PLoS (Public Library of Science) Pathogens (edited)\n(http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006487) \nMcCracken MK, Gromowski GD, Friberg HL, et al.

PLoS\nPathog. 2017; 13(8): e1006487. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006487\n-\nAbstract\n\nStudies have demonstrated cross-reactivity of anti-dengue virus (DENV)\nantibodies in human sera against Zika virus (ZIKV), promoting\nincreased ZIKV infection in vitro. However, the correlation between in\nvitro and in vivo findings is not well characterized. Thus, we\nevaluated the impact of heterotypic flavivirus immunity on ZIKV titers\nin biofluids of rhesus macaques. Animals previously infected (420 days\nor longer) with DENV2, DENV4, or yellow fever virus were compared to\nflavivirus-naïve animals following infection with a Brazilian ZIKV\nstrain. Sera from DENV-immune macaques demonstrated cross-reactivity\nwith ZIKV by antibody-binding and neutralization assays prior to ZIKV\ninfection, and promoted increased ZIKV infection in cell culture\nassays. Despite these findings, no significant differences between\nflavivirus-naïve and immune animals were observed in viral titers,\nneutralizing antibody levels, or immune cell kinetics following ZIKV\ninfection. These results indicate that prior infection with\nheterologous flaviviruses neither conferred protection nor increased\nobserved ZIKV titers in this non-human primate ZIKV infection model. Author summary\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne, emerging flavivirus. In\naddition to asymptomatic or mild febrile manifestations, ZIKV\ninfection in humans is associated with comparatively rare congenital\nand neurological abnormalities. Previous in vitro studies have\ndemonstrated cross-reactivity of antibodies derived from dengue virus\ninfections with ZIKV, as well as antibody-mediated enhancement of\ninfection in cell culture. Therefore, there is concern among\nvaccinologists and the public health community that the more severe\ndisease manifestations could result from prior immunity, either from\nnatural infection or vaccination, to antigenically-related\nflaviviruses (such as, dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis).\nIn this study, we evaluated the impact of prior immunity to dengue or\nyellow fever virus on ZIKV infection in a non-human primate model.\nAfter confirming that our immune cohorts were capable of\nrecapitulating the published in vitro observations of cross-reactivity\nand enhancement, we looked for alteration of viral titers in\nperipheral blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, and vaginal\nsecretions, as well as alterations in gross pathology, clinical\nparameters, and immune response, as compared to our flavivirus-naïve\ncohort. Importantly, no significant differences between\nflavivirus-naïve and primed animals were observed in viral titers or\nbiofluid distribution, neutralizing antibody levels, or immune cell\nkinetics following ZIKV infection. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org)\nand\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be)(promed@promedmail.org) Previous dengue infection, whether acquired naturally or antibody\nelicited by vaccines, has been a concern due to the possibility of\nantibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) with more severe disease. This\nconcern also relates to Zika virus antibody from vaccination for\nenhancement of dengue virus infections with resulting more severe\ndisease. The monkey studies reported above indicated that this may not\nbe a problem for Zika virus vaccinated individuals. Another effort to\navoid ADE is development of a vaccine that has epitopes specific for\nZika virus that are not shared by other flaviviruses. A group of\nresearchers developed a recombinant vaccine targeting a viral envelope\nsub-unit specific to the Zika virus\n((http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/news-and-analysis/news-in-brief/researchers-find-way-to-overcome-zika-vaccinedengue-virus-conundrum/20203379.article)).\nRoland Hübner is thanked for calling this latter reference to our\nattention. - Mod.TY \n<br><br><strong>{8}</strong> Virus inhibition.\nDate: 25 Jul 2017.\nSource: Nature Communications (edited)\n(https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15672) \nref: Yu Y, Deng YQ, Zou P, et al.

PLoS Pathog. 2017; 13(7): e1006537. doi:\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1006537\n-\nAbstract\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted virus that can cause\nsevere defects in an infected fetus. ZIKV is also transmitted by\nsexual contact, although the relative importance of sexual\ntransmission is unclear. To better understand the role of sexual\ntransmission in ZIKV pathogenesis, a nonhuman primate (NHP) model of\nvaginal transmission was developed. ZIKV was readily transmitted to\nmature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by vaginal inoculation was\nreadily transmitted to mature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by\nvaginal individual RM with 1-5 vaginal inoculations required to\nestablish infection. After treatment with Depoprovera, a widely used\ncontraceptive progestin, 2 RM that initially resisted 8 vaginal ZIKV\ninoculations became infected after one ZIKV inoculation. Thus,\nDepoprovera seemed to enhance susceptibility to vaginal ZIKV\ntransmission. Unexpectedly, the kinetics of virus replication and\ndissemination after intravaginal ZIKV inoculation were markedly\ndifferent from RM infected with ZIKV by subcutaneous (SQ) virus\ninoculation. Several groups have reported that after SQ ZIKV\ninoculation vRNA is rapidly detected in blood plasma with vRNA less\ncommon in urine and saliva and only rarely detected in female\nreproductive tract (FRT) secretions. In contrast, in vaginally\ninoculated RM, plasma vRNA is delayed for several days and ZIKV\nreplication in, and vRNA shedding from, the FRT was found in all 6\nanimals. Further, after intravaginal transmission ZIKV RNA shedding\nfrom FRT secretions was detected before or simultaneously with plasma\nvRNA, and persisted for at least as long. Thus, ZIKV replication in\nthe FRT was independent of, and often preceded virus replication in\nthe tissues contributing to plasma vRNA. These results support the\nconclusion that ZIKV preferentially replicates in the FRT after\nvaginal transmission, but not after SQ transmission, and raise the\npossibility that there is enhanced fetal infection and pathology after\nvaginal ZIKV transmission compared to a mosquito transmitted ZIKV. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{10}</strong> _Aedes albopictus_ populations as vectors.\nDate: 2 Aug 2017.\nSource: American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (edited)\n(http://www.ajtmh.org/content/journals/10.4269/ajtmh.16-0969) \nref: Azar SR, Roundy CM, Rossi SL, et al.

Positive saliva samples were assayed for\ninfectious titer. Although all 3 mosquito populations were susceptible\nto all ZIKV strains, rates of infection, dissemination, and\ntransmission differed among mosquito and virus strains. _Aedes\nalbopictus_ from Salvador, Brazil, were the least efficient vectors,\ndemonstrating susceptibility to infection to 2 American strains of\nZIKV but failing to shed virus in saliva. Mosquitoes from the Rio\nGrande Valley were the most efficient vectors and were capable of\nshedding all 3 tested ZIKV strains into saliva after 14 days of\nextrinsic incubation. In particular, ZIKV strain DakAR 41525 (Senegal\n1954) was significantly more efficient at dissemination and saliva\ndeposition than the others tested in Rio Grande mosquitoes.

Emerg Microbes\nInfect. 2017; 6(8): e69. doi: 10.1038/emi.2017.59\n-\nAbstract\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has recently been associated\nwith an increased incidence of neonatal microcephaly and other\nneurological disorders. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito\nbite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some\ncases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main\nvector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other\nmosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the\nvirus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit\nZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of\nlaboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_.\nInterestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the\nmidgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in\nRecife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially\nfed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced.\nCollectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range\nof ZIKV vectors than anticipated. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be) Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active\nvirus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their\nability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step\ntoward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_\nfed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in\nsaliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing.\nThe study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a\ncompetent vector. Several other studies have shown this species to be\ninefficient vectors or refractory to Zika virus infection. One wonders\nif the specific _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ used or the Zika virus isolates\nwith which they were tested could account for these very different\nresults. Resolving these discrepancies is important because this\nmosquito species is very widely distributed around the world and bears\ndirectly on risk of outbreaks in geographic areas where _Aedes\naegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_ , Zika virus vectors, do not occur. -\nMod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"115":{"title":"Dengue/DHF update (10): Asia, Pacific, Africa, research, WHO\r\n\t","date":["25","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/EDR> Dengue/DHF update (10): Asia, Pacific, Africa, research, WHO\r\n\t[EXTERNAL]","summary":"\nDENGUE/DHF UPDATE (10): ASIA, PACIFIC, AFRICA, RESEARCH, WHO\n\nA ProMED-mail post\n(http://www.promedmail.org)\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n(http://www.isid.org) In this update:\n<br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Cases in various countries Asia\n\nSri Lanka\n- National\n- National\n- National\nIndia\n- National\n- Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Assam\n- Delhi\n- Tamil Nadu (Coimbatore)\n- Tamil Nadu\n- Tamil Nadu (Chennai)\n- Tamil Nadu (Chennai)\n- Kerala\n- Karnataka\n- Karnataka (Gulbarga)\n- Karnataka (Gulbarga)\n- West Bengal (Kolkata)\n- West Bengal (Birbhum)\n- West Bengal (Siliguri)\n- Odisha (Ganjam)\n- Odisha\n- Gujarat (Ahmedabad)\n- Jharkhand (Jamshedpur)\n- Telangana (Hyderabad)\nPakistan\n- Sindh (Karachi)\n- Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (Peshawar)\n- Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (Peshawar)\n- Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (Peshawar)\nChina\n- Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region ex Viet Nam (susp)\n- Hong Kong SAR\n- Macau SAR\n- Macau SAR\nTaiwan\nMyanmar\n- National\n- Kayah\nIndonesia\n- Papua (Jayapura)\nViet Nam\n- National\n- National\n- Mekong Delta\n- Hanoi\n- Ha Nam\nPhilippines\n- National\n- Cebu\n- Negros Occidental\n- Negros Occidental (Bacolod City)\n- Cavite (Trece Martires City)\nLaos\n- National\nJapan ex Côte d'Ivoire Pacific\n\n- Samoa\n- Samoa\n- Samoa\n- Samoa\n- Fiji\n- French Polynesia (Tahiti) Africa\n\n- Côte d'Ivoire\n- Côte d'Ivoire <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Research\n- Viral persistence\n- Air travel related spread of dengue\n- Visual impact <br><br><strong>{3}</strong> World Health Organization update \n<br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Cases in various countries\nAsia\n\nSri Lanka\n- National. 26 Jul 2017.

This came about after 2\nkidney recipients in Taiwan were diagnosed with dengue 2 days after\nreceiving a kidney each from the same donor, said National Cheng Kung\nUniversity microbiology and immunology professor Dr Oscar Perng\nGuey-chuen. \"This indicates a potential risk,\" the Taiwan-based\nscientist said, adding that no dengue virus was detected in the\ndonor's blood. He said the donor contracted dengue in 2015 and in mid-2016, he died\nin an accident. His family donated his corneas, liver, heart, and\nkidneys. Both patients had the same strain of the dengue virus the\ndonor had in 2015 and one of the recipients died of dengue\nhaemorrhagic fever, he said. Asked where the virus could be hiding since it could not be detected\nin the blood, he said it was a question scientists are trying to\nanswer. Interestingly, those who received the donor's corneas, liver,\nand heart did not develop dengue, Dr Perng said on the sidelines of\nthe National Dengue And Arboviruses Infection Conference 2017\nyesterday 12 Aug 2017. He said although there was not enough\nevidence to show the virus came from the donor as the kidneys were not\ntested for dengue before the transplant, the same virus was found in\nthe patients' bodies after that. Dr Perng said his team had studied mice for dengue virus in the blood\ntestes, kidney, liver, spleen and brain, and found the virus present\nin the kidneys and brain. \"We believe the virus probably resided in\nthe kidneys and was not cleared by the body,\" he said, adding that the\nvirus could have been activated after transplant. He said this raised\nconcerns about asymptomatic people who are dengue carriers. Health Ministry deputy director, general Datuk Dr S Jeyaindran said\npatients with severe dengue would have better recovery if they were\ngiven colloids, a more concentrated fluid, at the early stage in fluid\nmanagement for dengue patients. Dr Jeyaindran, who was representing\nHealth Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam, said colloids may be\nintroduced at an earlier stage, instead of saline because it has not\nbeen successful in treating patients with severe dengue.

The spread of dengue to new areas is\nlikely due in large part to trends in air travel, researchers now\nreport in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Dengue virus affects as estimated 390 million people around the globe\neach year, and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild fever and\nheadache to severe low blood pressure. The virus has mostly caused\ndisease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, but a 2014\noutbreak in Japan broke that pattern. Overall, the geographic area\naffected by dengue has been growing in recent years. In the new work, Huaiyu Tian and Bing Xu, both of Beijing Normal\nUniversity, China, together with colleagues from the University of\nOxford and elsewhere analyzed the spread of dengue viruses in Asia\nfrom 1956 to 2015. They used 2202 genetic sequences of dengue viruses,\ncollected in 20 countries or regions of Asia over the 59 years, to\ndetermine how different strains were related. They also investigated\ntrends in air travel, maritime mobility, migration, and\nsocio-economics to determine what factors impact the spread of\ndengue. The spread of 3 different dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1, -2, and -3,\nis associated with air traffic more so than any other factors, the\ndata revealed. Air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India, the\nresearchers found, help seed dengue epidemics, while China, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, and Singapore help diffuse the virus to other Asian\ncountries. \"Future trends in global mobility could potentially accelerate the\nappearance and diffusion of DENV worldwide,\" the researchers say.\n\"Prevention and control of dengue epidemics requires a better\nunderstanding of its mode of geographic dissemination, especially for\ncountries in the tropics.\" Reference: Tian H, Sun Z, Faria NR, et al.

Source: The Nation, Thailand portal (edited) (http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/national/30325078)   \nPeople living in flooded areas have been warned to keep time spent wading through water to a minimum lest they be infected with melioidosis, a disease that has claimed 21 lives in 2017. Department of Disease Control (DDC) chief Dr Jessada Chokdamrongsuk reported on Mon 28 Aug 2017, that 1978 cases of melioidosis had been reported from 1 Jan 2017 to 22 Aug 2017.  The disease, caused by the bacterium _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ and prevalent during the rainy season in the subtropics, peaks every August in Thailand and has been wider spread this year 2017, he said. \"The bacterium thrives in contaminated water and soil and infects humans and animals through direct contact. People could get infected from prolonged exposure to contaminated water or soil, especially if they have any open sores or lesions in the skin,\" Jessada said. \"Infection can also come from consuming contaminated water or food.\"  Melioidosis produces a variety of acute and severe symptoms, he said, including long-lasting fever with no other apparent cause, ulcers or abscesses in the lungs, liver or spleen, and blood infections. The disease, which mainly affects adults, can be fatal, he said. Death has been known to result within 2-3 days of admission to hospital.  Risk factors for infection include chronic respiratory and lung disease, tuberculosis, diabetes, chronic renal disease, thalassemia, cancer, and immune-suppressing conditions unrelated to HIV. Jessada advised people coming into regular contact with floodwater to wear boots, drink only water that has been boiled, avoid raw and partially cooked food, wash immediately after exposure and seek medical attention if a fever persists for more than 5 days or abscesses become chronic.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  Melioidosis is a disease of the rainy season in its endemic areas. It mainly affects people who have direct contact with soil and water. Many have an underlying predisposing condition such as diabetes (commonest risk factor), renal disease, cirrhosis, thalassemia, alcohol dependence, immunosuppressive therapy, chronic obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and excess kava consumption. Kava is an herbal member of the pepper family that can be associated with chronic liver disease.  Melioidosis may present at any age, but peaks in the 4th and 5th decades of life, affecting men more than women. In addition, although severe fulminating infection can and does occur in healthy individuals, severe disease and fatalities are much less common in those without risk factors.  The most commonly recognized presentation of melioidosis is pneumonia, associated with high fever, significant muscle aches, chest pain, and  although the cough can be nonproductive  respiratory secretions can be purulent, significant in quantity, and associated with on-and-off bright, red blood. The lung infection can be rapidly fatal  with bacteremia and shock  or somewhat more indolent.  Acute melioidosis septicemia is the most severe complication of the infection. It presents as a typical sepsis syndrome with hypotension, high cardiac output, and low systemic vascular resistance. In many cases, a primary focus in the soft tissues or lung can be found. The syndrome, usually in patients with risk factor comorbidities, is characteristically associated with multiple abscesses involving the cutaneous tissues, the lung, the liver, and spleen, and a very high mortality rate of 80 to 95 percent. With prompt optimal therapy, the case fatality rate can be decreased to 40 to 50 percent.  The melioidosis bacillus is intrinsically insensitive to many antimicrobials. It should be noted that bioterrorism strains may be engineered to be even more resistant. _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ is usually inhibited by tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT), antipseudomonal penicillins, carbapenems, ceftazidime, and amoxicillin/clavulanate or ampicillin/sulbactam. Ceftriaxone and cefotaxime have good in vitro activity but poor efficacy; and cefepime did not appear, as well, to be equivalent to ceftazidime in a mouse model. The unusual antimicrobial profile of resistance to colistin and polymyxin B and the aminoglycosides but sensitivity to amoxicillin/clavulanate is a useful tool to consider in treatment of infection with the organism.  The randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing melioidosis treatment have been reviewed, and it was found that the formerly standard therapy of chloramphenicol, doxycycline, and SXT combination had a higher mortality rate than therapy with ceftazidime, imipenem/cilastatin, or amoxicillin/clavulanate (or ampicillin/sulbactam). The betalactam-betalactamase inhibitor therapy, however, seemed to have a higher failure rate. . Source: Tolaney P, Lutwick LI: Melioidosis. In: Lutwick LI, Lutwick SM (eds).

Five districts in 3 governorates are now infected.  The total number of cVDPV2 cases is 33 (this includes the previously reported 29 cases from Mayadeen district, Deir ez-Zor governorate, and 1 case from Tell Abyad district, Raqqa governorate). All confirmed cases to date have had onset of paralysis before 11 Jul 2017.  Final lab results for an additional 9 poliovirus type-2 (PV2) isolates from Deir ez-Zor are pending.  Discussions around expanding the scope of the immunization response to include accessible areas of a Tadmour sub-district in Homs, bordering Deir ez-Zor , will be held in light of the confirmation of the cases in this area.  Raqqa governorate commenced its 1st immunization round on 12 Aug 2017 (Raqqa and Thawra districts) and 13 Aug 2017 (Tell Abyad district). The immunization round aims to reach 120 000 children under 5 years of age. Preliminary information suggests the rounds are reaching children in all 3 districts.  Preparations continue for the 2nd round in Deir ez-Zor governorate, scheduled for 19-23 Aug 2017. IPV inactivated polio vaccine for use in the 2nd rounds in Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa governorates has arrived in Damascus.  The total number of AFP acute flaccid paralysis cases detected in Deir ez-Zor governorate since the beginning of 2017 is 113 (83 from Mayadeen, 11 from Deir ez-Zor, and 19 from Boukamal districts). Raqqa governorate has reported 16 AFP cases (5 from Raqqa, 10 from Tell Abyad, and 1 from Thawra districts). Homs governorate has reported 26 AFP cases (11 from Homs city, 12 from Rastan, 1 from Tadmour, and 2 from Talkalakh districts).  The Eradication and Outbreak Management Group (EOMG) has approved the release of additional doses of IPV to cover high risk population groups in northwest Syria, Turkey, and Lebanon. Lebanon requested 144 000 doses and has begun to implement IPV campaigns across the country.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  Unfortunately transmission of the cVDPV2 in Syria has continued. With each report, the date of onset of the most recent case shifts to a date approximately one month preceding the report, probably reflecting the time it takes from specimen collection to appropriate reference laboratory. We are fairly sure there will be an additional 9 cases confirmed from Deir ez-Zor, as the report above mentions that there are 9 poliovirus isolates pending typing (WPV vs cVDPV). The report also mentions a significant number of AFP cases identified in the 3 governorates, suggesting there may be more cases in the pipeline for confirmation. The control activities have been implemented during this week and will be implemented in additional areas next week week of 21 Aug 2017, so hopefully there will be interruption of transmission going forward.  The disturbing news in the situation report above, is that there is now involvement of 3 governorates. Deir ez-Zor, Raqqa, and now Homs. On a map of Syria showing provinces/governorates ((http://www.freeworldmaps.net/asia/syria/syria-political-map.jpg)), one can see that Deir ez-Zor, the main governorate involved in this outbreak is located in the northeast of the country sharing it's eastern border with Iraq. It shares a southern border with Homs, and a western border with Raqqa (Ar-Raqqah on this map) governorate. Hopefully the cVDPV2 will not continue to travel in the country outside of the currently 3 affected areas. - Mod.MPP   <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Somalia: declared polio free. Date: Mon 14 Aug 2017. Source: AllAfrica, Shabelle Media Network (Mogadishu) report (edited) (http://allafrica.com/stories/201708150227.html)   The UN World Health Organisation (WHO) said it had not recorded any case of polio disease in Somalia in the last 3 years, declaring the country polio free.  The WHO said the country recorded the last case of polio in 2014 in the central part of the country but has since then remained free of the paralyzing disease.  The UN health agency, however, warned Somalia remained vulnerable, calling for continued vaccination campaign, Xinhua News Agency reported.  The head of the WHO Eastern Mediterranean, which covers Somalia, Mohamed Fiqi said that massive vaccination campaigns and commitment from government and international actors had ensured the polio virus did not recur in the Horn of Africa country.  \"As the world edges closer to eradicating polio, keeping alert in countries that have high risk of polio importation like Somalia is more of priority than ever,\" Fiqi said.  \"As we move forward, the polio programme in Somalia needs to continue to work to maintain and improve the level of population immunity against polio through target vaccination campaign and strengthening of the routine immunisation services and infrastructure,\" Fiqi added.  The declaration by WHO keeps Somalia outside the last group of countries which still record cases of polio in the world.  Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan are the remaining countries where polio is still being recorded. The WHO chief warned Somalia remains at risk of importation of the virus from these countries.  Somalia President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo praised efforts to rid his country of the polio disease which he noted had subjected many children into suffering.  \"No cases were found for the past 3 years and no child was affected by this disease. Many of our children have suffered from polio for many years.  \"To eradicate polio was a big success and it was collective effort and commitment by many young men and women who sacrificed their lives,\" Farmaajo noted.  The 3 year polio-free celebration comes amidst the worst outbreak of measles the country has seen in years.  Somalia is also still responding to an outbreak of acute watery diarrhoea/cholera, which began in January 2017. Polio systems and networks are being used in both interventions.  \"Polio infrastructure has been critical in responding to these other serious outbreaks,\" said Fiqi.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  Achieving 3 years with no new cases of polio reported is a significant achievement for Somalia. That being said, it's important to remember that this too is a country with internal civil strife and warring factions, which may impede the identification of poliovirus associated disease either due to infrastructural challenges in good specimen collection and transport, or access of the population to the healthcare infrastructure. A reminder is the identification of WPV associated cases in Borno, Nigeria last year (2016), involving a virus last seen 5 years before in the same state.

We continue to work together to advance shared priorities, including governance and democracy, regional security, poverty reduction, polio eradication, trade, defense, and the fight against climate change.\"  - The 14th Emergency Committee for polio eradication under the International Health Regulations met on 3 Aug 2017 and has made its recommendations to the WHO Director-General, who has accepted them. The Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and recommended the extension of revised Temporary Recommendations for a further 3 months. The key change is the inclusion of DR Congo and Syria in the category 'States infected with cVDPV2s, with potential risk of international spread'.  - Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: Afghanistan: 1 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case; Pakistan: 1 new WPV1-positive environmental sample; Syrian Arab Republic: 3 new circulating vaccine-derived polio type 2 (cVDPV2) from Syria, 2 from Deir ez-Zor and 1 from Homs governorates. Details in country-specific sections below.  Afghanistan  - One new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week, bringing the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 to 6. It is the most recent case in the country, and had onset of paralysis on 10 Jul 2017, from Zabul province, neighbouring Kandahar province and Pakistan. - Afghanistan continues to coordinate activities with neighbouring Pakistan, to address both cross-border transmission and focus on reaching mobile populations with oral polio vaccine (OPV). Transmission linking both countries runs primarily across 3 corridors, namely: eastern Afghanistan and Khyber-Peshawar, Pakistan; greater Kandahar/Helmand and Quetta, Pakistan; and, Paktika/Patkya/Khost and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa/Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Pakistan.  Pakistan  - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week; the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 3. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 11 Jun 2017, from Killa Abdullah, Balochistan. - 1 new WPV1-positive environmental sample was reported in the past week, collected on 28 Jul 2017, from Quetta, Balochistan. - A special vaccination round is being implemented during August 2017 targeting areas with recent polio cases and positive environmental samples. These include Rawalpindi/Islamabad and demographically connected areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Quetta Block, and parts of Karachi. - Under the National Emergency Action Plan for polio eradication, the country is planning to implement 2 nation-wide and 2 sub-national vaccination rounds from September to December 2017.  Nigeria - - No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 21 Aug 2016 in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno. - Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016). - Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance.  Lake Chad Basin  - The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno, Nigeria in 2016) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) (Borno and Sokoto provinces in Nigeria in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak. - Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.  Central Africa  - No new cases of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). The total number of cVDPV2 cases this year 2017 remains 7, in 2 separate outbreaks: in Haut Lomami province (5 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on 13 Jun 2017); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on 26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017, with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May 2017). - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time. Outbreak response is taking place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols, targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 across the 2 provinces. - The 1st mOPV2 round was implemented on 27-29 Jun 2017 in the 2 affected provinces; and the 2nd mOPV2 round ran from 13-15 Jul 2017 in Haut Lomami and 20-22 Jul 2017 in Maniema. - Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.  Middle East  - In Syria, 3 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were officially reported in the past week. The total number of cases in this outbreak is 33. Onset of paralysis of these cases is between 3 Mar 2017 and 10 Jul 2017. 31 of the cases are from Deir ez-Zor governorate (29 from Mayadeen district, one from Deir ez-Zor district, and one from Boukamal district); 1 case is from Talabyad district, Raqqa governorate; and, 1 is from Tadmour district in Homs governorate. - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized and implemented, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Two vaccination campaigns are planned for both Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa governorates. If there is geographic spread, the extent of these campaigns will have to be adjusted. - The 1st mOPV2 round in Deir ez-Zor was successfully carried out between 22-26 Jul 2017. Independent post-campaign monitoring reflected coverage of 88.4 percent (based on caregiver recall).

(promed@promedmail.org)  This week's global update is similar to prior weeks in terms of low level identification of WPV1 associated disease (a single case confirmed in Afghanistan this past week), one positive WPV1 isolated from an environmental sample in Pakistan, and 3 newly confirmed cVDPV2 associated cases in Syria.  That being said, there have only been 9 confirmed cases of WPV1 associated paralytic disease worldwide this year (2017), compared with 37 cases reported last year (2016). In contrast there have been 40 confirmed cases of cVDPV2 confirmed this year (2017) compared with 5 last year (2016). As a reminder, outbreaks due to cVDPV's are considered as significant in the big picture of polio eradication, as they are due to vaccine polioviruses that have reverted in neurovirulence following passage through multiple individuals while circulating in the susceptible population. The goal of the polio eradication initiative is to interrupt transmission of both the WPV's and the cVDPVs. The presence of cVDPVs occurs when there are areas with low vaccination coverage where the vaccine virus (from the OPV) can continue circulating through the susceptible population.

Measles outbreaks have been registered in all 41 counties,\nthe most affected  with over 1000 cases each  being Timis (1215\ncases), Caras-Severin (1110), and Arad (1002). The measles outbreak in Romania in 2016 is not circumstantial, but a\ndirect consequence of the \"major\" malfunctions in public policy\nregarding vaccination, minister of health Florian Bodog stated on Fri\n11 Aug in a press release. \"For years now Romania has been below the\nsafety threshold of vaccination coverage. That is, the risk of a\nmeasles outbreak was imminent. Which is what actually happened. The\noutbreak of the measles epidemic in 2016 is not conjectural, it is a\ndirect consequence of major malfunctions in the public policy on\nvaccination,\" the minister of health stated. According to him, the Vaccination Law corrects the irregularities that\nled to the epidemic, providing the best conditions for protecting\nchildren's health. \"For Romania, the stake of the vaccination bill is\nhuge. Ensuring a healthy future for 4 million children lies in our\nhands. The Romanian parliament, the highest institution of democracy,\nwill decide on the final content of this law. However, beyond the\ndebates in parliament, it is important that all the public opinion be\ninformed and understand the true meaning of the law and the profound\nchanges it brings. (..) We have a moral duty towards our children, to\nprevent harm before it happens. As we also have a moral duty to the\ncommunity in which we live to prevent harm before it happens to other\nchildren or parents,\" Bodog said, quoted in the press release. He added that any bill is amendable and that is why it is open to any\npublic debates as long as they are carried out with honesty, good\nsense and decency. \"But this project is the day-to-day work of\nspecialists in the field of vaccination and who have faced all the\nflaws of the current framework. That is why the law has been carefully\nand correctly thought through by those who best understand how to\nregulate the vaccination policy,\" the minister of health also said. The bill on the organisation and funding of public vaccination in\nRomania was adopted by the government on Wed 9 Aug 2017. The bill\nwas submitted to parliament for debate and adoption.

The index case had just returned from visiting family in the Ukraine\nwhere he likely contracted the disease. When he returned to Israel he\nvisited a clinic where he infected 8 other soldiers who were waiting\nin line to see a physician. \"The IDF, together with the Health\nMinistry, carried out an investigation to locate the cases and\nidentify the source of the infection,\" the army said in a statement,\nadding that all those who had contact with the soldiers had been\ngiven preventative treatment. An IDF spokesman told The Jerusalem Post\nthat the soldier who contracted the disease had 2 stopovers in Europe\non his way back to Israel from the Ukraine but was not able to specify\nwhich countries.

The Health Ministry has stated that the level of\nvaccine coverage in Israel is among the highest in the West, with 97\nper cent coverage for 1st and 2nd doses MMR and chickenpox vaccine. While no vaccine is 100 per cent effective, an infectious disease\nspecialist told the Post that measles is \"a nasty illness\" that is\npreventable by proper immunization. But while it is highly recommended\nby medical professionals and the Health Ministry, the vaccine is not\nmandatory and according to the IDF the measles vaccine is not part of\nthe vaccines given to new recruits. \"We cannot afford to have soldiers\nwho are severely ill with a highly contagious disease. It would be\nappropriate for the IDF to verify and update immunizations of all\npersonnel and new recruits,\" the infectious disease specialist told\nthe Post. Measles is spread by coughing and sneezing and close contact with\ninfected individuals. While most infected people usually experience\nonly mild symptoms it is one of the leading causes of death among\nyoung children globally. Measles takes about 8-12 days following\ncontact before the individual will show symptoms which include a\nfever, bad cough, red eyes, and a runny nose. A few days after the\nrespiratory symptoms, the infected individual will get a bad rash.\nOther complications of measles include gastroenteritis (diarrhea and\nvomiting), pneumonia, severe bleeding problems, and in some rare cases\nencephalitis (brain infections).

The public has also been urged to look out for\ncommon early symptoms associated with the disease, which include high\nfever, cough, red swelling eyelids and muscle and body irritability. According to the Ministry of Health, an estimated 20 per cent of\npeople who get infected with measles often develop complications,\nwhich if not managed early enough can lead to death. Despite previous\nmass vaccination campaigns, Uganda has had several outbreaks of the\ndisease. Prof Mbonye blamed it on parents who do not take their\nchildren for immunisation at the right time.

On 20 Aug 2017, the ministry received blood samples of 2 patients from Kiboga and Nakaseke hospital suspected Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF).  According to a 21 Aug 2017 statement signed by the acting Director General, health services Dr Anthony Mbonye, the 2 victims tested positive to Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever CCFH.  CCHF is a common disease among humans and animals caused by caused by a tick-borne virus (_Nairovirus_); the virus causes severe viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 percent.  Dr Mbonye says that the general supportive care with treatment of symptoms is the main approach to managing CCFH among humans. The statement warns that while its symptoms do not appear in the infected animal, it appears in a very dangerous way in human beings.  \"You are required to work with the office of the District Veterinary Officer to strengthen measures against CCHF control in animals, implement interventions to reduce the risk of CCHF infections among humans, and interventions to control CCFH in health care settings.  You are also reminded to immediately report and investigate any CCFH suspected cases in your district,\" reads the statement in part signed by Dr Mbonye.  CCHF virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter.  According to Ministry of health, the majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians and that human-to-human transmission occurs from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of infected persons.  Hospital-acquired infections can also occur due to improper sterilization of medical equipment, reuse of needles, and contamination of medical supplies.  Records indicate that since 2000, Uganda has experienced repeated outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF). Ebola VHF outbreak occurred in the districts of Gulu in 2000, Bundibugyo, 2007, Luwero, 2011, Kibaale in July 2012, Luwero in November 2012. Marburg VHF was earlier reported in Ibanda in 2007. More recently in 2012, 2 outbreaks of Marburg VHF have occurred in Ibanda and Kabale districts.  Signs and symptoms of CCHF  Sudden, with fever, myalgia, (muscle ache), dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes and photophobia (sensitivity to light), nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and sore throat early on, followed by sharp mood swings and confusion.  After 2 to 4 days, the agitation may be replaced by sleepiness, depression, and lassitude, and the abdominal pain may localize to the upper right quadrant, with detectable hepatomegaly (liver enlargement).

(promed@promedmail.org)  CCHF is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and Asian countries south of the 50th parallel north  the geographical limit of the principal tick vector. The hosts of the CCHF virus include a wide range of wild and domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats.  Animals become infected by the bite of infected ticks and the virus remains in their bloodstream for about one week after infection, allowing the tick-animal-tick cycle to continue when another tick bites. Although a number of tick genera are capable of becoming infected with CCHF virus, ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_ are the principal vector. The CCHF virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Human-to-human transmission is possible.  The report above does not mention any clinical features of the cases.

The\nfollowing is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In:\nChronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract.\nGreydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in\npress): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons,\nvaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside\nof Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as\n60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection\nlengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness,\nespecially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until\nreports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:\n- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1\nwith recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some\nprotection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;\n- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and\nO139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata,\nIndia, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of\nthis product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years\nwas 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A\nlocally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced\nin Viet Nam;\n- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains\nboth O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been\nreported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine\nfor use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine,\nVaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a\nreformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose\nimmunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the\nfrozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given\nuntil at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be\ngiven at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial\nprophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older\ninactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however,\nhave suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be\neffective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and\noutbreak situations (63, 64). \"References\n\n57.

Eight cases, including 2 deaths have been reported from Nakaseke and Kiboga districts as of 28 Aug 2017.  The Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries, and CDC deployed a multi-disciplinary rapid response team to the 2 districts to conduct outbreak investigation and rapid risk assessment. The epidemiology team is in the field to investigate the source of the outbreak and conduct contact tracing.  CCHF is known to be endemic in Uganda, especially in the cattle corridor, which is a strip of land spanning across 18 districts, from the southwest to the northeast of the country. Smaller intermittent outbreaks have been reported in the past. The last outbreak occurred in August 2013, during which 6 cases were reported.  The simultaneous occurrence of the current outbreak in 2 neighboring districts may be indicative of a larger burden of the disease than expected. The current drought in some parts of the country could heighten the risk of the disease spreading to other areas as a result of livestock movement in search of pasture and water.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  The current report indicates that at least 2 adjacent districts have reported CCHF cases, located mainly in cattle raising areas. It is important to reach out with public health education focusing on several aspects, including use of protective clothing such as long sleeves and trousers. People should be advised to wear light coloured clothes during a visit to the animal market to allow easy detection of ticks, and to regularly examine clothing and skin for ticks, and, if found, removing them safely, and using approved repellents on clothing and skin. Furthermore, studies may be planned to map the distribution of the tick species, particularly in the cattle belt region. - Mod.UBA  A map showing the districts of Uganda can be found at: (http://guidetouganda.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/UgandaBig.jpg).- Mod.MPP  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/97).

Among these cases there were 32 deaths, as follows: 8 in\nTimis County, 6 in Arad, 7 in Dolj, 3 in Caras-Severin, and one in\neach Bihor, Cluj, Calarasi, Satu Mare, Vaslui, Galati, Mures, and\nBucharest. Measles outbreaks have been registered in all 41 counties,\nthe most affected  with over 1000 cases each  being Timis (1215\ncases), Caras-Severin (1110), and Arad (1002). The measles outbreak in Romania in 2016 is not circumstantial, but a\ndirect consequence of the \"major\" malfunctions in public policy\nregarding vaccination, minister of health Florian Bodog stated on Fri\n11 Aug in a press release. \"For years now Romania has been below the\nsafety threshold of vaccination coverage. That is, the risk of a\nmeasles outbreak was imminent. Which is what actually happened. The\noutbreak of the measles epidemic in 2016 is not conjectural, it is a\ndirect consequence of major malfunctions in the public policy on\nvaccination,\" the minister of health stated. According to him, the Vaccination Law corrects the irregularities that\nled to the epidemic, providing the best conditions for protecting\nchildren's health. \"For Romania, the stake of the vaccination bill is\nhuge. Ensuring a healthy future for 4 million children lies in our\nhands. The Romanian parliament, the highest institution of democracy,\nwill decide on the final content of this law. However, beyond the\ndebates in parliament, it is important that all the public opinion be\ninformed and understand the true meaning of the law and the profound\nchanges it brings. (..) We have a moral duty towards our children, to\nprevent harm before it happens. As we also have a moral duty to the\ncommunity in which we live to prevent harm before it happens to other\nchildren or parents,\" Bodog said, quoted in the press release. He added that any bill is amendable and that is why it is open to any\npublic debates as long as they are carried out with honesty, good\nsense and decency. \"But this project is the day-to-day work of\nspecialists in the field of vaccination and who have faced all the\nflaws of the current framework. That is why the law has been carefully\nand correctly thought through by those who best understand how to\nregulate the vaccination policy,\" the minister of health also said. The bill on the organisation and funding of public vaccination in\nRomania was adopted by the government on Wed 9 Aug 2017. The bill\nwas submitted to parliament for debate and adoption. The normative act\nwould come into force on 1 Jan 2018. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) A similar report can be found in El Pais (12 Aug 2017) which states\nin addition that, of the 95 per cent vaccine coverage recommended by\nthe World Health Organization (WHO), 86 per cent have been\nvaccinated since 2007, according to its national epidemiological\ncentre. \"Highly worrying\" figures, acknowledged the prime minister,\nMihai Tudose, this week. \"More than 180 000 children in our country,\nfrom 9 months to 9 years, are not immunized against measles. In some\nregions, the rate of immunization of the 2nd dose does not reach 50\nper cent; and this is very serious.\" Timis and Caras-Severin, Arad\n(all to the west of the country, near the border with Serbia or\nHungary), are the most affected, with more than 1000 measles cases\neach, reported in the last 10 months when the outbreak was declared. According to official estimates, nearly 50 000 children without\nimmunization are not even registered with a family doctor. Most is due\nto serious problems of social exclusion.

The 6 people are now\nout of danger, and the 4 hospitalised patients were able to return\nhome, says the regional Agency of health (ARS), Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes,\ncited by France Bleu. These are all people who live or work in this\nsmall town of 1100 habitats. The ARS called for vigilance and prompted the inhabitants of the\nnorthern Ardèche, to consult a doctor in case of fever and appearance\nof buttons rash. It alerted on the very high contagiousness of the\nvirus that can infect up to 20 people around a sick person, and they\ncan produce severe, even life-threatening disease  in fact, there is\nno curative treatment for measles. In addition, the ARS has been reported to France Bleu that the recent\nconfirmed cases of measles in Ardoix were unvaccinated. According to\nthe figures of the LRA, 71 per cent of the inhabitants of the Ardèche\nregion are vaccinated against measles, which is 10 per cent less than\nthe national average. The government has confirmed its willingness to make mandatory 8\nvaccines, including measles. On this disease, \"Vaccination coverage\namong children at 2 years of age reaches only 78 per cent. As long as\nit does not reach the 95 per cent the risk of epidemic wave periodic\nwill persist\", has declared Agnès Buzyn. Measles has made its 1st victim in France at the end of July 2017.

The index case had just returned from visiting family in the Ukraine\nwhere he likely contracted the disease. When he returned to Israel he\nvisited a clinic where he infected 8 other soldiers who were waiting\nin line to see a physician. \"The IDF, together with the Health\nMinistry, carried out an investigation to locate the cases and\nidentify the source of the infection,\" the army said in a statement,\nadding that all those who had contact with the soldiers had been\ngiven preventative treatment. An IDF spokesman told The Jerusalem Post\nthat the soldier who contracted the disease had 2 stopovers in Europe\non his way back to Israel from the Ukraine but was not able to specify\nwhich countries. WHO in March 2017 warned of a measles outbreak sweeping across\nEurope in places where immunization rates have plummeted. The figures\ncover the agency's entire European region  53 countries including\nIsrael, Kazakhstan, and Russia. According to WHO 559 measles cases\nwere reported in Europe between January and March 2017. While the\nlargest current measles outbreaks in Europe were reported in Romania\nand Italy, other countries reporting cases were France, Germany,\nPoland, Switzerland, and the Ukraine. \"With steady progress toward\nelimination over the past 2 years, it is of particular concern that\nmeasles cases are climbing in Europe,\" said Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO\nregional director for Europe. \"Today's travel patterns put no person\nor country beyond the reach of the measles virus. Outbreaks will\ncontinue in Europe, as elsewhere, until every country reaches the\nlevel of immunization needed to fully protect their populations.\" Israeli children are routinely immunized with the MMR measles, mumps,\nrubella vaccine which are given in 2 doses, at 1 year and a booster\nin the 1st grade. The Health Ministry has stated that the level of\nvaccine coverage in Israel is among the highest in the West, with 97\nper cent coverage for 1st and 2nd doses MMR and chickenpox vaccine. While no vaccine is 100 per cent effective, an infectious disease\nspecialist told the Post that measles is \"a nasty illness\" that is\npreventable by proper immunization. But while it is highly recommended\nby medical professionals and the Health Ministry, the vaccine is not\nmandatory and according to the IDF the measles vaccine is not part of\nthe vaccines given to new recruits. \"We cannot afford to have soldiers\nwho are severely ill with a highly contagious disease. It would be\nappropriate for the IDF to verify and update immunizations of all\npersonnel and new recruits,\" the infectious disease specialist told\nthe Post. Measles is spread by coughing and sneezing and close contact with\ninfected individuals. While most infected people usually experience\nonly mild symptoms it is one of the leading causes of death among\nyoung children globally. Measles takes about 8-12 days following\ncontact before the individual will show symptoms which include a\nfever, bad cough, red eyes, and a runny nose. A few days after the\nrespiratory symptoms, the infected individual will get a bad rash.\nOther complications of measles include gastroenteritis (diarrhea and\nvomiting), pneumonia, severe bleeding problems, and in some rare cases\nencephalitis (brain infections). In June 2017, 5 cases of measles were reported to the Health\nMinistry  all of them women between the ages of 20-40 who lived in\nJerusalem. byline: Anna Ahronheim \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) Even with 97 per cent vaccine coverage, measles virus can cause small\noutbreaks.

Measles is an airborne disease that affects mostly children between\nthe ages of 6 months and 10 years, although it can also affect\nadults. Although Prof Mbonye said there was no cause for alarm, he urged the\npublic to be vigilant and report any suspected cases to the nearest\nhealth facilities. The public has also been urged to look out for\ncommon early symptoms associated with the disease, which include high\nfever, cough, red swelling eyelids and muscle and body irritability. According to the Ministry of Health, an estimated 20 per cent of\npeople who get infected with measles often develop complications,\nwhich if not managed early enough can lead to death. Despite previous\nmass vaccination campaigns, Uganda has had several outbreaks of the\ndisease. Prof Mbonye blamed it on parents who do not take their\nchildren for immunisation at the right time. Current national\nimmunisation coverage stands at 85 per cent. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) According to WHO, in 2016 global vaccination coverage (all vaccines)\nwas stalled at 86 per cent, with no significant changes during the\npast year. For measles alone, by the end of 2016, 85 per cent of\nchildren had received 1 dose of vaccine by their 2nd birthday, and 164\ncountries had included a 2nd dose as part of routine immunization; 64\nper cent of children received 2 doses of measles vaccine according to\nnational immunization schedules. It is generally thought that because\nmeasles is such a highly transmissible disease, that 90-95 per cent of\npeople must be vaccinated in order to protect the entire population,\nor achieve herd immunity.

The total amount of dead wild boars discovered in the woods around\nZlín, in the far east of the Czech Republic, stood at 94 at the end\nof August 2017. In this month, 23 new infected carcasses were found,\nwhich is a downward trend from July 2017, when 68 reports were sent\nto the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). The 1st report of\nASF in Czech wild boars was on Wed 21 Jun 2017. Many neighbouring countries have alerted their local pig producers to\nbe very careful what to feed their pigs - and their inhabitants what\nto purchase and how to dispose of it. So did Slovakia, according to\nthe Slovak Spectator. Zlín is only a few km away from the western\nSlovak border, to its north is Poland where ASF has been around since\n2014 and on its eastern border is Ukraine, where ASF has been\nconfirmed since 2011. In a presentation, given in mid-July 2017 to the European\nCommission's Standing Committee On Animals, Plants, Food and Feed\n(SCoPAFF), Dr Petr Šatrán of the Czech State Veterinary\nAdministration indicated that human activities are most likely the\ncause of the spread of the virus, seeing that the nearest reported\ncases of ASF were roughly 500 km 310.68 mi away and that the\npositive dead wild boars were found in inhabited areas. In the other country where ASF was found for the 1st time in 2017,\nRomania, things appear relatively quiet. News broke early this month\nAugust 2017 that ASF was also found on 2 backyard farms in the north\nof the country. Ever since, the Romanian authorities did not report\nany further outbreaks of ASF to the OIE. Of all other countries in the European Union, especially Poland has\ncontinued to report outbreaks of African Swine Fever in smaller and\nmiddle-sized operations. In August alone, on 23 farm sites of various\nsizes, ASF was found to have infected at least one animal, after which\nthe entire herd would have to be culled. The biggest operation in this respect was a farm near Monki, Podlaskie\nprovince, where all remaining 431 pigs had to be culled after 11 had\ndied as a result of ASF, on Sat 19 Aug 2017. Noteworthy as well was\nthe ASF-related closure of 2 farms in Lack, Lubelskie province, in\nearly August. These farms had 136 and 141 pigs respectively see also\nitem 2.

This was said by Poland's Minister of Agriculture,\nKrzysztof Yurgel, Niezalezna reports. As reported, the length of the fence will be 729 km 452.98 mi,\ncosting Poland 130 million zloties (more than 36.2 million USD). The\nfinal decision on a fence will be made within the next 3 weeks. According to experts, ASF has developed in the territory of Poland\n\"thanks to\" the wild boars who entered from Belarus. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) The accumulated ASF OIE data from Poland as of Thu 31 Aug 2017, are\nas follows (start of event 22 May 2014):\nNumber of follow-up reports: 189\nTotal outbreaks: 550 (Submitted)\nSpecies/ Susceptible/ Cases/ Deaths/ Killed and disposed of/\nSlaughtered\nWild boar/ - / 620 / 620 / 0 / 0\nDomestic Swine/ 6303/ 402/ 188/ 6097/ 0 A map showing ASF cases reported globally to the OIE since 1 Jan 2017,\nas of Thu 31 Aug 2017, is available at (http://tinyurl.com/ybexasqm).\nClick on the European cluster, zoom in to each of the countries of\ninterest. EU disease control measures require designation of risk areas as Part\nI (wild boar at risk, but no cases found), Part II (wild boar testing\npositive but no spill over into domestic pigs), Part III (cases in\nwild boar and occasional spill over into domestic pigs) and Part IV\nwhich concerns the island of Sardinia only. Consignments of live pigs,\nlive wild boars, meat of either source and animal by-products of\neither source are only allowed under certain derogations. For a full\nexplanation, see European Commission Implementing Decision\n2014/708/EU. ASF, a viral disease against which no vaccine has become available so\nfar, is currently threatening central and western Europe, where dense\npopulations of wild boar are present. According to a recent update of DEFRA (UK) ASF situation assessment,\nthe continuing cases in the Czech Republic, the spread in Poland which\nappears to be due to several breakdowns in biosecurity and the new\noutbreaks in Romania are \"concerning\". This signifies a spread in\ngeographic distribution, a possible drop in biosecurity awareness and\ntherefore an increase in the weight of infection in East Europe. Despite the relatively low level of trade in live pigs, there could be\na substantial movement of people, vehicles and personal imports of\npork products, therefore the risk of ASF introduction to the UK has\nbeen raised from \"very low\" (that is, \"rare but could occur\") to\n\"low\". The Russian veterinary watchdog Rosselkhoznadzor believes ASF will\nkeep moving west via 2 main pathways. The southerly route, has already\nseen the virus spread from Ukraine to Moldova. Russian vets believe it\ncould penetrate central Romania, then move to the Balkans, including\nBulgaria and Serbia. On the northern route, now that ASF has been found in the Czech\nRepublic, Rosselkhoznadzor believes, if it gains a foothold, it is\nlikely to head further west, with Germany next in the firing line.

Clearly\ntransmission is continuing in this area, with 3 newly confirmed\nsecondary cases in household contacts - at least 2 of whom were\nidentified through screening of asymptomatic household contacts, and 2\nadditional cases in which high risk exposures are still under\ninvestigation. We do not know if these household contacts are\nassociated with the earlier identified transmission chain in Dawmat\nAljandal or if these are newly identified chains of transmission. The\nother 2 newly confirmed cases involve \"sporadic\" cases - an individual\nin Hail whose high risk exposure history is still under investigation,\nand an individual from Alaflaj (Riyadh region) with a history of\ndirect contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. As to be expected, concern is being voiced on the international level\nwith the upcoming Hajj and this recent increase in cases reported both\nin Saudi Arabia and in the UAE. We now have gone through 5 Hajj\nperiods since the identification of the MERS-CoV and to date there\nhave been no cases of MERS-CoV infection identified in returning\nHajjis. The case in the UAE (see section <br><br><strong>{1}</strong> above) actually had onset\nof illness over 1 month ago with no secondary cases/infections\nidentified among known contacts of this case. As for the cases in\nSaudi Arabia, and more specifically the Hajj, population movement is\nvery well defined during the Hajj, no camels are permitted in the\nareas where Hajjis are congregated, and there are Hajj specific health\nservices that are separate from those that are available for the\ngeneral Saudi population, all factors that are reducing the likelihood\nof Hajjis having inadvertent (or intentional) high risk exposures.\nHopefully my optimism is well placed and we will pass through a 6th\nHajj period without impact on international transmission of the\nMERS-CoV associated with this Hajj.

Growers should be aware of the higher risks of barley yellow\ndwarf virus (BYDV) infection in crops sown this autumn 2017 and were\nadvised by Hutchinsons' Crop Consultants Cam Murray to make every\neffort to mitigate the possible impacts. He said that pressure in several areas of Scotland had been\n\"excessive\" after large flights of aphids through spring, with classic\nyellowing symptoms found in spring oats, barley, and wheat. \"This\nmeans that early-sown winter barley crops will be at particularly high\nrisk this autumn,\" he said. The most effective way to protect early\ngrowth was to use a seed treatment and well-timed follow-up spray.

Man­itoba Agriculture's Holly Derksen said, \"I think this is\nprobably the most severe that I've seen it.\" It is unclear if there\nare other, unreported, cases. The virus also may take root in its\nnamesake barley or other cereals like wheat. \"It does seem like this year 2017 there are some bigger patches and\nwhen it is a severely infected plant you will not have seed\nproduction,\" she said. \"It really depends on the incidence in the\nfield, but if there are big patches that are affected, there could be\nsome significant yield loss.\" Byline: Alexis Stockford \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) Barley yellow dwarf (BYD) disease occurs worldwide and affects a wide\nrange of grass species (Gramineae) including cereal crops like barley,\nwheat, oats, rice, maize, and rye. It is the most destructive of the\nvirus diseases for wheat. Grain yields may be reduced by 1/3. Symptoms\ninclude leaf discolouration from yellow to purple (depending on the\nhost species), stunting, reduced tillering, and empty seed heads.\nPlants infected in autumn may not survive the winter or show severe\nsymptoms when growth resumes. Diseased plants often occur in circular\npatches within a field, which are associated with colonisation by the\naphid vectors. BYD viruses have now been split into several species in the family\nLuteoviridae (mostly in the genus _Luteovirus_). They are\ndifferentiated by their ability to be transmitted by various aphid\nspecies (family Aphididae) and their virulence on a selected variety\nof oats. Some of the viruses are transmitted equally well by several\naphids, whereas others can be transmitted by only one or 2 species.\nThe bird cherry(-oat) aphid (_Rhopalosiphum padi_) and grain (wheat)\naphid (_Sitobion avenae_) are vectors of the severe _Barley yellow\ndwarf virus-PAV_ (type member of genus _Luteovirus_). Coinfections of\nseveral BYD viruses may occur in one plant, which can result in either\nmore severe (synergistic) or milder (due to cross protection)\nsymptoms, depending on the virus partners. The viruses cannot be transmitted by seed, pollen, or mechanical means\nand cannot survive in stubble or in the soil. Volunteer cereal plants\nor grassy weeds may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management\nincludes use of crop cultivars with reduced sensitivity to the viruses\nand control of the aphid vectors. In Europe, a current outbreak of BYD is also being reported from\nIreland (ProMED-mail post\nhttp://promedmail.org/post/20170609.5094454).

Experts traced the\nshopping habits of 60 infected people to a form of own-brand sausages\nfrom a retailer known only as \"supermarket X\". The British government\nhas declined to name the specific shop, but multiple sources\nreportedly told The Sunday Times that it was Tesco. The strain, hepatitis E, is typically found in pork products imported\ninto the UK from Europe. According to the PHE website, signs of the\ndisease in humans vary from no symptoms to liver failure. In rare\ncases, it can prove fatal, particularly in pregnant women. This week\n(20 Aug 2017), the Sunday Times reported that research completed back\nin 2016 was withheld from publication until now over alleged\n\"sensitivity\". Scientists believe that imported pork products infect 150 000-200 000\nBritish citizens a year. The paper said: \"The implicated products are\npork sausages, which require cooking prior to consumption, and\nready-to-eat pre-packed sliced ham.\" It noted that \"Only supermarket\nX, especially own brand, was significantly associated with the\nvirus.\" Tesco has not commented on the findings, but told The Sunday Times\nthat it had already started a conversation with the Food Standards\nAgency (FSA) about how to minimize the spread of such viruses. \"The\nassociation with the supermarket does not infer any blame,\" PHE said. One scientist, professor Richard Tedder of the government's National\nInfection Service agency, agreed. \"Something appears to have changed\nin animal husbandry so too many pigs are infected at slaughter. This\nis a problem for meat producers and all retailers, not just one.\" Person to person transmission of the virus is very rare, however it\nhas been known to pass on via blood transfusions, PHE has said. The\nnumbers of confirmed hepatitis E cases and infections increased\nsignificantly between 2010 and 2016, it warned. According to a report\non PigWorld (http://tinyurl.com/yd4fd34r), a spokesperson from the\nNational Pig Association (NPA) acknowledged the sudden spike in cases\nbut said that \"further research and surveillance\" was required to\n\"determine the true cause of the rise in hepatitis E cases in the UK.\"\nThe statement continued: \"NPA recommends that consumers follow the\nadvice from the Food Standards Agency that pork and sausages should be\ncooked thoroughly until steaming hot throughout, with no pink or red\nin the center, to greatly reduce the risk of infection.\" byline: Jason Murdock \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) The publication cited is:\nSaid B, Usdin M, Warburton F, et al. Pork products associated with\nhuman infection caused by an emerging phylotype of hepatitis E virus\nin England and Wales. Epidemiol Infect. 2017; 145(12): 2417-23. doi:\n10.1017/S0950268817001388. Epub 2017 Jul 31;\n(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28756783)\n\nAbstract\n\n\"Since 2010, human hepatitis E infections have increased in England\nand Wales. Most cases are locally acquired and caused by hepatitis E\nvirus genotype 3 (HEV G3). HEV G3 is linked to the consumption of pork\nproducts. The increase is associated with the emergence of a new\nphylotype, HEV G3-group 2 (G3-2, also known as G3abcdhij). 60\nindividuals with confirmed hepatitis E infection and no history of\ntravel outside the UK were recruited: 19 were infected with HEV\nG3-group 1 (G3-1 or G3efg) and 41 with G3-2. Epidemiological data\nrelating to usual shopping habits and consumption of ham and sausages\nwere analysed together with typing data to identify any associations\nwith HEV phylotype. Study participants who purchased ham and/or\nsausage from a major supermarket were more likely to have HEV G3-2\ninfection (relative risks 1.85, P = 0·06, CI 0·97-3·53). The HEV\nG3-2 phylotype has not been detected in indigenous UK pigs and it is\nsuggested that human infections could be the result of consumption of\nproducts made from pork originating outside the UK. This does not\ninfer blame on the supermarket but the epidemiology of HEV is dynamic\nand reflects complex animal husbandry practices which need to be\nexplored further.\" This report underscores the importance of zoonotic hepatitis E\n(primarily genotype 3) as the cause of hepatitis E emergence in\nEurope. There are currently 7 genotypes of HEV and genotypes 1 and 2\nare not zoonotic and cause most of the HEV infections in Africa and\nAsia. It is these genotypes that cause increased morbidity and\nmortality in pregnant women. Most of the zoonotic hepatitis E cases\nhave been recognized in the developed world, are associated with\nfoodborne disease (usually undercooked pork products) and are caused\nby genotype 3. In addition, infection with genotype 3 when occurring\nin immunocompromised hosts (especially solid organ transplant\nrecipients) can cause chronic infection which can progress to\ncirrhosis. Ribavirin has been used to treat such individuals with\nchronic infection. The author's summary of their work states \"Study participants who\npurchased ham and/or sausage from a major supermarket were more likely\nto have HEV G3-2 infection (Relative risks 1.85, P = 0·06, CI\n0·97-3·53)\" although the posting above quotes the paper (?in the\nfull text which is not available to this moderator) as \"Only\nsupermarket X, especially own brand, was significantly associated with\nthe virus.\" The statistics noted in the summary gives a relative\nrisk of 1.85 which supports an increased risk of almost 2 times but\nthe p value of 0.06 and a confidence interval overlapping 1.0 both do\nnot reach statistical significance so \"more likely\" is better than\n\"significantly associated\". Be that as it may, there is no doubt that\nacquisition of zoonotic HEV in Europe is clearly linked to ingestion\nof undercooked pork products that was carrying the virus. Adequate\ncooking and appropriate kitchen practices to avoid cross-contamination\nwill minimize, if not erase totally, this risk. - Mod.LL A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at:\n(http://healthmap.org/promed/p/40).

(promed@promedmail.org)  According to the Nepal page on WRLFMD website, the last occurrence of FMD serotype A in Nepal took place in 1997. Since 2010, and as of March 2017, the FMDV strain circulating in Nepal has continuously been O/ME-SA/Ind-2001d (in 2015, there was also a single detection of O/ME-SA/PanAsia-2 KAT-15). For the said and additional information on Nepal's FMD past records, including genotyping results (though not yet of the newly introduced A/ASIA/G-VII lineage), see (http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/asia/nep.htm).  The identification of the A/ASIA/G-VII lineage in Nepal represents further spread of this virus, which had been evolving in India many years back (\"A/IND/40/2000\", genotyped A/ASIA/G-VII, was collected in 1999). In 2010, this strain was detected in Myanmar. In 2015, it appeared for the 1st time in the Middle East (\"FMD Pool 3\"), being detected in Saudi Arabia followed, during the same year, by Iran, Turkey and Armenia. Most recently (May 2017), this virus was identified in Northern Israel, on the Lebanese and Syrian borders.  According to the information included in the Guest Editor's comments to EuFMD's (European Commission for the control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease) monthly report \"Global Foot-and-Mouth Disease Situation\", June 2017, there were reports of poor performance of vaccine strains derived from the A/ASIA/Iran-05 strain against the A/ASIA/G-VII lineage. The guest editor, Don King (head of the Vesicular Disease Reference Laboratory Group in the Pirbright Institute and WRLFMD), disclosed that WRLFMD, in partnership with the FMD Reference Laboratories in Lelystad (The Netherlands) and Geelong (Australia), has undertaken vaccine potency trials for alternative candidate vaccines; preliminary data indicated that the A-May-97 vaccine may provide protection in cattle, in contrast to the A22 vaccine, which does not appear to induce a protective response. The said data were to \"be presented in more detail shortly\". The said and additional information is available at (http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd/docs/FMD_monthly_reports/2017/June2017.pdf).  The Indian subcontinent (\"FMD Pool 2\") is the source of 2 FMD strains which have demonstrated, in recent years, a long-distance (trans-regional) transmission, causing losses in \"FMD Pool 3\" countries and threatening Europe. These are FMDV serotype O, topotype ME-SA, strain Ind-2001d and FMDV serotype A, topotype Asia, genotype (strain) VII. While the routes of dissemination are yet to be clarified, the FMD situation within India, a major beef exporter, including its vaccination policy and vaccines efficacy, deserves being visited. - Mod.AS  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/19830).

The invasive Asiatic mosquitoes can carry dengue fever and the chikungunya virus, and attack in daylight.  Experts from Public Health England destroyed the batch of mosquito eggs and larvae at the busy Ashford International truck stop earlier this month August 2017. This is the 2nd time that one of the planet's most dangerous insects  so-named because of its striped body and legs  has been discovered entering into the UK during the last year.  Asian tiger mosquitoes  scientific name, _Aedes albopictus_  have been spreading across Europe and are blamed for up to a million global cases of chikungunya globally every year. The disease has no cure and leaves victims in a fever and with excruciating joint pains as well as headaches, nausea and rashes. There is a death risk of one in a thousand cases. France confirmed 4 cases in 2014 and there was an epidemic in Italy a decade ago.  Asian tiger mosquitoes are spreading the disease through the way their eggs and larvae have been exported from native forest haunts in south east Asia in tyre imports. The grubs eggs can survive for months and larvae and pupae develop in small pockets of water retained by tyres.  To counter the threat, the authorities are maintaining a \"mosquito surveillance programme\" at 30 UK ports and airports as well as checks at motorway services on routes from south coast ports and Eurotunnel. Dr Jenny Harries, deputy medical director at Public Health England, said: \"Through these activities we identified a small number of eggs and larvae from the _Aedes albopictus_ mosquito in traps at Ashford International truck stop.  byline: Stuart Winter   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  This report of the discovery of _Aedes albopictus_ at a truck stop in Kent appears to be valid this time and illustrates how this species can be moved internationally. A 2014 report of _Aedes aegypti_ in southern England was rejected. A statement by Jolyon Medlock, head of Medical Entomology & Zoonoses Ecology, Public Health England, Microbiological Research Authority (MRA), Emergency Response Department, Health Protection and Medical Directorate, Porton Down, Salisbury stated, \"This is misleading information as no invasive aedes mosquitoes have been found in the UK. There have been a number of news articles in British newspapers recently 2014 about invasive mosquitoes, reporting mainly on efforts to increase surveillance for _Aedes albopictus_, however no confirmed reports of any invasive aedes mosquito have been found during this surveillance, nor have any reports been submitted to the Medical Entomology group at Public Health England.\" (see Invasive mosquito - UK (02): (England) comment http://promedmail.org/post/20140923.2795988).  Intensive surveillance will be carried out this time as well. One hopes that successful aggressive efforts to eliminate the mosquitoes before they can become established, as they have become established in Italy and southern France. - Mod.TY  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6406).

Cyclosporiasis is the least-common reportable protozoan infection in the United States. In 2008, the reported disease rate among 10 states was 2.25 per 100 000 population.  The true incidence of foodborne cyclosporiasis in the United States has been estimated at 11 407 to 19 808 cases per year (15 hospitalizations), accounting for 0.1 percent of all foodborne illness. Approximately 42 percent of cases are imported.  1110 individual cases of cyclosporiasis were reported during 1997 to 2008. 849 (76.5 percent) of the cases occurred in 7 states, including 498 (44.9 percent of total) in Florida. 51.7 percent of cases with known travel history were autochthonous.  No fatal cases were reported during 1998 to 2006.  During 1998 to 2002, 9 foodborne outbreaks (325 cases) of cyclosporiasis were reported; 0 in 2007; 3 (66 total cases) in 2008; 1 (8 cases) in 2009; 0 in 2010. 11 outbreaks (3533 cases) related to imported food were reported during 1996 to 2014.  Reported disease rates have increased somewhat since 2012. See graph at (https://www.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/cyclosporiasis.png)  Chronology of reported outbreaks: - 1990. Outbreak (20 cases) among health-care workers at a hospital in Chicago, Illinois. Related to contaminated water - 1995. Outbreak at a country club in New York State - 1995. Outbreak in Florida associated with consumption of contaminated fresh raspberries. - 1996. Multiple outbreaks (1465 cases, 978 confirmed) in at least 15 states including New York (307), Florida (220), Massachusetts (170), New Jersey (103), South Carolina (38). Vehicles included raspberries and other fruit. The raspberries were imported from Guatemala and were thought to have been contaminated by water used in pesticide sprays. - 1997. Outbreak (56 cases) at a hotel in Texas. - 1997. Outbreaks (25 event-associated case clusters encompassing 370 cases) reported from 8 states (California, Florida, Maryland, Nebraska, Nevada, Rhode Island, New York, and Texas) and Canada (Ontario). - 1997. Outbreaks (26 clusters encompassing 228 cases) reported from Virginia, Washington DC, and Baltimore. Fresh basil and basil-pesto sauce implicated as the source. An additional 20 possible clusters (75 cases) were under investigation at the time. - 1997. Outbreaks (over 1700 cases during a 5-month period) associated with raspberries, mesclun lettuce, and basil. Fresh raspberries, imported from Guatemala, were implicated in 19 of 21 outbreaks/70 sporadic cases confirmed in the United States and Canada during this period. - 1998. Outbreak (57 cases) at a wedding in Massachusetts was associated with contaminated berries. - 1999. Outbreaks (62 cases in 2 outbreaks) in Missouri were associated with fresh basil, grown in either the United States of Mexico. - 2000. Outbreak (54 cases) at a wedding in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was ascribed to imported (Guatemalan) raspberries in a wedding cake.

Source: The Horse (edited) (http://www.thehorse.com/articles/39562/dressage-horse-detained-after-positive-glanders-test)   An American dressage horse returning to the United States after a competition tour in Europe has tested positive for Glanders. Shipped from Amsterdam to Miami after participating in Sweden and UK  An American dressage horse returning to the United States after a competition tour in Europe could be euthanized or shipped back out of the country after testing positive for glanders during routine USDA equine import quarantine.  Glanders is a highly contagious upper respiratory disease that can be passed from horse-to-horse as well as to human handlers. Acute clinical signs include fever; cough; difficulty breathing; nasal discharge; swollen and painful submaxillary lymph nodes (the \"glands\" in \"glanders\"); rapidly spreading ulcers on the nasal mucosa, nodules, and chronic abscesses; and small abscesses in the lung and/or abscesses in the liver or spleen, among others. Clinical signs of chronic glanders include coughing; malaise; weight loss; intermittent fever; possible thick nasal discharge, usually out of one nostril; ulcers and nodules on the nasal mucosa; enlarged submaxillary lymph nodes; chronic enlargement and induration (hardening) of lymphatics and lymph nodes; joint swelling and painful leg edema (fluid swelling); and nodules, particularly on the legs, that rupture, release pus, and ulcerate. Glanders has been eradicated from North American and was last reported in the United States in the 1940s. It's recently been reported in several areas around the world, however, including South America, Eastern Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and a rare case in Germany in 2014.  Earlier this month August 2017, the 18-year-old Dutch Warmblood gelding Sagacious HF was shipped from Amsterdam to the Miami International Airport after participating in competitions in Sweden and England with Chase Hickok. Under USDA rules, all horses entering the United States, except those coming from Canada, must be quarantined and tested for 4 diseases  dourine, glanders, equine piroplasmosis, and equine infectious anemia  upon arrival.  Jeanine Neskey, interim public affairs specialist for the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), said an animal that produces a positive test result is denied entry to the United States.  \"Denied entry means that it must be either removed from the U.S. or be euthanized,\" she said. \"If the horse is denied entry into the U.S. (and not euthanized), the owner is free to take the horse to any other country that will accept it.\"  Scott Leibsle, DVM, Idaho's deputy state veterinarian, said Sagacious could have contracted the disease through contaminated feed or through water buckets also used by other horses participating in competitions. The gelding might also have been an asymptomatic carrier of the disease, possibly developing signs after experiencing stress  \"Transport is the most stressful thing you can do to a horse,\" he said. \"At the same time, you're putting it with new animals in a new area, and putting it under the stress of competition.\"  Currently APHIS uses a complement fixation test (CFT) to detect glanders. However, the agency is evaluating other testing methods, including the Western Blot procedure.  \"Advancing research and improved technology continue to develop new or improved testing methods for animal diseases,\" Neskey said. \"USDA routinely evaluates all testing methods available and incorporates the methods most appropriate to the needs of import quarantine testing.\"  After Sagacious produced a 2nd positive CFT glanders test, he produced a negative Western Blot glanders test. Arrangements were made to place him on extended quarantine pending the results of additional testing with both tests, slated for Wed 23 Aug 2017.  Byline: Pat Raia   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  Glanders, also known as farcy, is a contagious infectious disease of equines, acute or chronic, usually fatal, caused by the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_, and characterized by the development of ulcerated nodules that are most commonly found in the upper airway, lungs ,and skin. Felines and other animals are susceptible to infection, which is usually fatal. Humans can be infected and the microorganism (_B. mallei_) is considered a potential bioterrorism agent.  The disease, one among the oldest known and that used to be prevalent worldwide, is currently eradicated or effectively controlled in many countries. Recently the disease has been reported in some countries, including Iraq, Turkey, Pakistan, India, Mongolia, China, Brazil, United Arab Emirates, and countries in Africa. Glanders is one of the diseases contained in the list of diseases for mandatory reporting to the World Animal Health Organization (OIE).  The bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_ a clonal pathogen, can be found in nasal secretions and skin ulcers of infected animals. The transmission of glanders occurs commonly from intake of water or food contaminated with nasal secretions and exudates eliminated from infected animals, contact with contaminated equipment (saddles, harness) and by eating contaminated equine meat.  In the nasal form, nodules arise in septum and turbinates. Nodules progress to irregular edged ulcers; star-shaped scars are characteristic after the resolution of the ulcers. In the early stage, submandibular lymph nodes are enlarged and edematous, adhering to the skin and deep tissues in advanced stages of the disease. In the pulmonary form, inflammatory nodules with caseous or calcified centers are found in the lungs. With the progression of the disease areas of consolidation and pneumonia may be present. The nodules may break and eliminate the inflammatory content into the bronchial tree, spreading the infection to the upper respiratory tract. In the cutaneous form, nodules arise along the lymphatic vessels, especially on the extremities. The nodules may degenerate to form ulcers with drainage of highly infectious purulent material. The liver and spleen may have typical nodular lesions. Histologically, vasculitis, thrombosis, inflammatory cell infiltration and degeneration can be seen.  A test based on complement fixation can also be used for screening, but the ELISA test, although more sensitive, is not being routinely used. PCR can be used for specific identification ((https://www.merckvetmanual.com/generalized-conditions/glanders/overview-of-glanders)).  There are no vaccines. Prevention and control depend on early detection and eliminating infected animals in addition to quarantine and complete disinfection. Treatment, administered only in endemic areas, which does not lead to microbiological cure, is the use of doxycycline, ceftazidime, gentamycin, or streptomycin. Sulfa drugs (including in combination with trimethoprim) seem to be effective in prevention and glanders treatment ((http://www.merckmanuals.com/vet/generalized_conditions/glanders/overview_of_glanders.html?qt=glanders&alt=sh#Diagnosis)).  For glanders-free countries, there are OIE recommendations on importing equines. An international veterinary certificate is required attesting that the animals showed no clinical signs of glanders and were kept in an exporting country free of the disease for at least 6 months prior to shipment ((http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/GLA-EN.pdf)). It appears foreign horse owners will not be able to comply, therefore will be unable to repatriate their show horses? Further information would be welcome.  OIE WAHID's latest information shows continuing glanders in Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais states in 2014 (red circles on map; zoom in), but there have been no immediate or continuing event reports for Brazil in 2015. The OIE report and map are available at (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=11974).  As a horse owner, this would be devastating. We certainly hope Sagacious test later this month August 2017 clears him of this disease. - Mod.TG  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/212).

Information about the cases appears in this week's FluView report.  The cases bring the number of novel flu infections reported this year 2017 to 19, all but 1 reported in the last 30 days.  The CDC said all 3 patients had contact with swine at agricultural fairs. At this time, 2 of the viruses have been fully characterized and are influenza A H3N2 variant (H3N2v) viruses. The 3rd virus has been characterized as an influenza A (H3) variant, and tests are under way to further characterize it. A variant influenza strain occurs when an influenza A virus that normally circulates in swine is detected in humans.  A total of 4 states now report cases Texas, Ohio, North Dakota, and Pennsylvania are the only states to report variant strains this year 2017, with Ohio reporting 15 H3 variant viruses and one H1N2 variant virus (the other states have reported one H3N2v case each).  Of the 3 cases announced todayFri 18 Aug 2017, 2 people attended the same fair. The Pennsylvania resident's exposure occurred out of state, according to FluView. The North Dakota Department of Health released a statement on Tue 15 Aug 2017 that said 2 people, one an out-of-state visitor, contracted the variant virus at the North Dakota State Fair in Minot.  Two of the 3 patients were hospitalized, and all 3 have fully recovered from their infections. One patient was older than 64; the other 2 were children.  H3N2v was 1st detected in humans in 2011. In 2012, the CDC confirmed 309 United States cases, most linked to exposure at swine exhibits. Last year 2016, 18 cases were reported.  Byline: Stephanie Soucheray   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  The total number of Influenza A/H3N2v cases reported in 2017 reported during 2017 is 18 to date Fri 18 Aug 2017 (according to the latest update on CDC webpage (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/h3n2v-case-count.htm) with 2 hospitalizations.  Clinical characteristics of the A/H3N2v cases are generally consistent with those of seasonal influenza including fever, cough, pharyngitis, myalgia, and headache.  Rapid detection and characterization of novel influenza viruses are important components of national efforts in the United States to prevent further cases and evaluate clinical illness associated with these viruses. As a result, clinicians are reminded to consider influenza as a possible diagnosis when evaluating patients with acute respiratory illnesses, and clinicians should consider the possibility of H3N2v in persons presenting with respiratory illness and recent swine contact or attendance at an agricultural fair ((https://emergency.cdc.gov/HAN/han00351.asp)). - Mod.UBA  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/240).

Here we evaluate the risk of Zika virus transmission through\nmucosal contact in rhesus macaques. Application of high-dose Zika\nvirus directly to the tonsils of 3 rhesus macaques results in\ndetectable plasma viremia in all animals by 2 days post-exposure;\nvirus replication kinetics are similar to those observed in animals\ninfected subcutaneously. 3 additional macaques inoculated\nsubcutaneously with Zika virus served as saliva donors to assess the\ntransmission risk from contact with oral secretions from an infected\nindividual. 7 naive animals repeatedly exposed to donor saliva via the\nconjunctivae, tonsils, or nostrils did not become infected. Our\nresults suggest that there is a risk of Zika virus transmission via\nthe mucosal route, but that the risk posed by oral secretions from\nindividuals with a typical course of Zika virus infection is low. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall It is good to learn that Zika virus transmission via mucosa is\nunlikely.

Update: Interim guidance\nfor health care providers caring for pregnant women with possible Zika\nvirus exposure  United States (including US Territories), July 2017.\nMMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2017; 66(29): 781-93. doi:\n10.15585/mmwr.mm6629e1\n-\nCDC has updated the interim guidance for US health care providers\ncaring for pregnant women with possible Zika virus exposure in\nresponse to 1) declining prevalence of Zika virus disease in the World\nHealth Organization's Region of the Americas (Americas) and 2)\nemerging evidence indicating prolonged detection of Zika virus\nimmunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies. Zika virus cases were 1st reported\nin the Americas during 2015-2016; however, the incidence of Zika virus\ndisease has since declined. As the prevalence of Zika virus disease\ndeclines, the likelihood of false-positive test results increases. In\naddition, emerging epidemiologic and laboratory data indicate that, as\nis the case with other flaviviruses, Zika virus IgM antibodies can\npersist beyond 12 weeks after infection. Therefore, IgM test results\ncannot always reliably distinguish between an infection that occurred\nduring the current pregnancy and one that occurred before the current\npregnancy, particularly for women with possible Zika virus exposure\nbefore the current pregnancy. These limitations should be considered\nwhen counseling pregnant women about the risks and benefits of testing\nfor Zika virus infection during pregnancy. This updated guidance\nemphasizes a shared decision-making model for testing and screening\npregnant women, one in which patients and providers work together to\nmake decisions about testing and care plans based on patient\npreferences and values, clinical judgment, and a balanced assessment\nof risks and expected outcomes. For these recommendations, the definition of possible Zika virus\nexposure has not changed and includes travel to, or residence in an\narea with risk for mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission or sex with\na partner who has traveled to or resides in an area with risk for\nmosquito-borne Zika virus transmission. These areas can be found on\nthe CDC \"Zika Travel Information\" webpage. Key recommendations include the following:\n1- All pregnant women in the United States and US territories should\nbe asked about possible Zika virus exposure before and during the\ncurrent pregnancy, at every prenatal care visit. CDC recommends that\npregnant women not travel to any area with risk for Zika virus\ntransmission. It is also recommended that pregnant women with a sex\npartner who has traveled to or lives in an area with risk for Zika\nvirus transmission use condoms or abstain from sex for the duration of\nthe pregnancy.\n2- Pregnant women with recent possible Zika virus exposure and\nsymptoms of Zika virus disease should be tested to diagnose the cause\nof their symptoms. The updated recommendations include concurrent Zika\nvirus nucleic acid test (NAT) and serologic testing as soon as\npossible through 12 weeks after symptom onset.\n3- Asymptomatic pregnant women with ongoing possible Zika virus\nexposure should be offered Zika virus NAT testing 3 times during\npregnancy. IgM testing is no longer routinely recommended because IgM\ncan persist for months after infection; therefore, IgM results cannot\nreliably determine whether an infection occurred during the current\npregnancy. The optimal timing and frequency of testing of asymptomatic\npregnant women with NAT alone is unknown. For pregnant women who have\nreceived a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection (by\neither NAT or serology positive/equivocal Zika virus or dengue virus\nIgM and Zika virus plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) 10 and\nhigher and dengue virus PRNT less than 10 results) any time before or\nduring the current pregnancy, additional Zika virus testing is not\nrecommended. For pregnant women without a prior laboratory-confirmed\ndiagnosis of Zika virus, NAT testing should be offered at the\ninitiation of prenatal care, and if Zika virus RNA is not detected on\nclinical specimens, 2 additional tests should be offered during the\ncourse of the pregnancy coinciding with prenatal visits.\n4- Asymptomatic pregnant women who have recent possible Zika virus\nexposure (that is, through travel or sexual exposure) but without\nongoing possible exposure are not routinely recommended to have Zika\nvirus testing. Testing should be considered using a shared\npatient-provider decision-making model, one in which patients and\nproviders work together to make decisions about testing and care plans\nbased on patient preferences and values, clinical judgment, a balanced\nassessment of risks and expected outcomes, and the jurisdiction's\nrecommendations. Based on the epidemiology of Zika virus transmission\nand other epidemiologic considerations (such as, seasonality),\njurisdictions might recommend testing of asymptomatic pregnant women,\neither for clinical care or as part of Zika virus surveillance. With\nthe decline in the prevalence of Zika virus disease, the updated\nrecommendations for the evaluation and testing of pregnant women with\nrecent possible Zika virus exposure but without ongoing possible\nexposure are now the same for all areas with any risk for Zika virus\ntransmission.\n5- Pregnant women who have recent possible Zika virus exposure and who\nhave a fetus with prenatal ultrasound findings consistent with\ncongenital Zika virus syndrome should receive Zika virus testing to\nassist in establishing the etiology of the birth defects. Testing\nshould include both NAT and IgM tests.\n6- The comprehensive approach to testing placental and fetal tissues\nhas been updated. Testing placental and fetal tissue specimens can be\nperformed for diagnostic purposes in certain scenarios (e.g., women\nwithout a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection and\nwho have a fetus or infant with possible Zika virus-associated birth\ndefects). However, testing of placental tissues for Zika virus\ninfection is not routinely recommended for asymptomatic pregnant women\nwho have recent possible Zika virus exposure but without ongoing\npossible exposure and who have a live born infant without evidence of\npossible Zika virus-associated birth defects.\n7- Zika virus IgM testing as part of preconception counseling to\nestablish baseline IgM results for non pregnant women with ongoing\npossible Zika virus exposure is not warranted because Zika virus IgM\ntesting is no longer routinely recommended for asymptomatic pregnant\nwomen with ongoing possible Zika virus exposure. also at the source URL above:\nAdditional interim guidance:\n- Laboratory testing of pregnant women with exposure to areas with\nrisk for Zika virus transmission\n- Prenatal management of pregnant women with laboratory evidence of\npossible Zika virus infection\n- Evaluation of placental and fetal tissue specimens for Zika virus\ninfection \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org)\nand\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be)(promed@promedmail.org) Readers interested in accessing the full report can find it at the\nsource URL above.

What is the spectrum of neurologic manifestations in adults\nwith Zika virus infection?\nFindings. This cohort study evaluated adult patients with new-onset\nparainfectious or neuroinflammatory disease for the presence of acute\nZika virus infection in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples\nusing molecular and serological testing. An increase in the incidence\nof Guillain-Barré syndrome and encephalitis was observed compared\nwith the period before the outbreak of the Zika virus.\nMeaning The Zika virus may be associated with a rapid increase in the\nincidence of life-threatening neurologic syndromes; serologic and\nmolecular testing using blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples can\nserve as an alternative diagnostic strategy. Abstract\n\nImportance. There are no prospective cohort studies assessing the\nincidence and spectrum of neurologic manifestations secondary to Zika\nvirus (ZIKV) infection in adults.\nObjective. To evaluate the rates of acute ZIKV infection among\npatients hospitalized with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS),\nmeningoencephalitis, or transverse myelitis.\nDesign, setting, and participants. A prospective, observational cohort\nstudy was conducted at a tertiary referral center for neurological\ndiseases in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between 5 Dec 2015-10 May 2016,\namong consecutive hospitalized adults (older than 18 years of age)\nwith new-onset acute parainfectious or neuroinflammatory disease. All\nparticipants were tested for a series of arbovirosis. 3-month\nfunctional outcome was assessed.\nInterventions. Samples of serum and cerebrospinal fluid were tested\nfor ZIKV using real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain\nreaction and an IgM antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent\nassay. Clinical, radiographic (magnetic resonance imaging),\nelectrophysiological, and 3-month functional outcome data were\ncollected.\nMain outcomes and measures. The detection of neurologic complications\nsecondary to ZIKV infection.\nResults. 40 patients (15 women and 25 men; median age, 44 years\nrange, 22-72 years) were enrolled, including 29 patients (73\npercent) with GBS (90 percent Brighton level 1 certainty), 7 (18\npercent) with encephalitis, 3 (8 percent) with transverse myelitis,\nand 1 (3 percent) with newly diagnosed chronic inflammatory\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy. Of these, 35 patients (88 percent) had\nmolecular and/or serologic evidence of recent ZIKV infection in the\nserum and/or cerebrospinal fluid. Of the patients positive for ZIKV\ninfection, 27 had GBS (18 demyelinating, 8 axonal, and 1 Miller Fisher\nsyndrome), 5 had encephalitis (3 with concomitant acute neuromuscular\ndisease), 2 had transverse myelitis, and 1 had chronic inflammatory\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy. Admission to the intensive care unit was\nrequired for 9 patients positive for ZIKV infection (26 percent), and\n5 (14 percent) required mechanical ventilation. Compared with\nadmission during the period from 5 Dec 2013 - 10 May 2014 (before the\nBrazilian outbreak of ZIKV), admissions for GBS increased from a mean\nof 1.0 per month to 5.6 per month, admissions for encephalitis\nincreased from 0.4 per month to 1.4 per month, and admissions for\ntransverse myelitis remained constant at 0.6 per month. At 3 months, 2\npatients positive for ZIKV infection (6 percent) died (1 with GBS and\n1 with encephalitis), 18 (51 percent) had chronic pain, and the median\nmodified Rankin score among survivors was 2 (range, 0-5).\nConclusions and relevance. In this single-center Brazilian cohort,\nZIKV infection was associated with an increase in the incidence of a\ndiverse spectrum of serious neurologic syndromes. The data also\nsuggest that serologic and molecular testing using blood and\ncerebrospinal fluid samples can serve as a less expensive, alternative\ndiagnostic strategy in developing countries, where plaque reduction\nneutralization testing is impractical. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) This study illustrates the need to consider post-Zika virus infection\nas a cause of a variety of neurological diseases.

We found that ZIKV\npersistently infects brain endothelial cells that normally protect\nneurons from viral exposure. hBMECs are not damaged by ZIKV infection\nand, analogous to persistent HCV infection, ZIKV constitutively\ninduces and evades antiviral ISG IFN-stimulated genes and IFN\ninterferon responses to continuously replicate in hBMECs. As a\nresult, hBMECs provide a protective niche for systemic ZIKV spread and\na viral reservoir localized in the normally protective blood-brain\nbarrier.

PLoS\nPathog. 2017; 13(8): e1006487. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006487\n-\nAbstract\n\nStudies have demonstrated cross-reactivity of anti-dengue virus (DENV)\nantibodies in human sera against Zika virus (ZIKV), promoting\nincreased ZIKV infection in vitro. However, the correlation between in\nvitro and in vivo findings is not well characterized. Thus, we\nevaluated the impact of heterotypic flavivirus immunity on ZIKV titers\nin biofluids of rhesus macaques. Animals previously infected (420 days\nor longer) with DENV2, DENV4, or yellow fever virus were compared to\nflavivirus-naïve animals following infection with a Brazilian ZIKV\nstrain. Sera from DENV-immune macaques demonstrated cross-reactivity\nwith ZIKV by antibody-binding and neutralization assays prior to ZIKV\ninfection, and promoted increased ZIKV infection in cell culture\nassays. Despite these findings, no significant differences between\nflavivirus-naïve and immune animals were observed in viral titers,\nneutralizing antibody levels, or immune cell kinetics following ZIKV\ninfection. These results indicate that prior infection with\nheterologous flaviviruses neither conferred protection nor increased\nobserved ZIKV titers in this non-human primate ZIKV infection model. Author summary\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne, emerging flavivirus. In\naddition to asymptomatic or mild febrile manifestations, ZIKV\ninfection in humans is associated with comparatively rare congenital\nand neurological abnormalities. Previous in vitro studies have\ndemonstrated cross-reactivity of antibodies derived from dengue virus\ninfections with ZIKV, as well as antibody-mediated enhancement of\ninfection in cell culture. Therefore, there is concern among\nvaccinologists and the public health community that the more severe\ndisease manifestations could result from prior immunity, either from\nnatural infection or vaccination, to antigenically-related\nflaviviruses (such as, dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis).\nIn this study, we evaluated the impact of prior immunity to dengue or\nyellow fever virus on ZIKV infection in a non-human primate model.\nAfter confirming that our immune cohorts were capable of\nrecapitulating the published in vitro observations of cross-reactivity\nand enhancement, we looked for alteration of viral titers in\nperipheral blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, and vaginal\nsecretions, as well as alterations in gross pathology, clinical\nparameters, and immune response, as compared to our flavivirus-naïve\ncohort. Importantly, no significant differences between\nflavivirus-naïve and primed animals were observed in viral titers or\nbiofluid distribution, neutralizing antibody levels, or immune cell\nkinetics following ZIKV infection. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org)\nand\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be)(promed@promedmail.org) Previous dengue infection, whether acquired naturally or antibody\nelicited by vaccines, has been a concern due to the possibility of\nantibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) with more severe disease. This\nconcern also relates to Zika virus antibody from vaccination for\nenhancement of dengue virus infections with resulting more severe\ndisease. The monkey studies reported above indicated that this may not\nbe a problem for Zika virus vaccinated individuals. Another effort to\navoid ADE is development of a vaccine that has epitopes specific for\nZika virus that are not shared by other flaviviruses. A group of\nresearchers developed a recombinant vaccine targeting a viral envelope\nsub-unit specific to the Zika virus\n((http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/news-and-analysis/news-in-brief/researchers-find-way-to-overcome-zika-vaccinedengue-virus-conundrum/20203379.article)).\nRoland Hübner is thanked for calling this latter reference to our\nattention. - Mod.TY \n<br><br><strong>{8}</strong> Virus inhibition.\nDate: 25 Jul 2017.\nSource: Nature Communications (edited)\n(https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15672) \nref: Yu Y, Deng YQ, Zou P, et al.

PLoS Pathog. 2017; 13(7): e1006537. doi:\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1006537\n-\nAbstract\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted virus that can cause\nsevere defects in an infected fetus. ZIKV is also transmitted by\nsexual contact, although the relative importance of sexual\ntransmission is unclear. To better understand the role of sexual\ntransmission in ZIKV pathogenesis, a nonhuman primate (NHP) model of\nvaginal transmission was developed. ZIKV was readily transmitted to\nmature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by vaginal inoculation was\nreadily transmitted to mature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by\nvaginal individual RM with 1-5 vaginal inoculations required to\nestablish infection. After treatment with Depoprovera, a widely used\ncontraceptive progestin, 2 RM that initially resisted 8 vaginal ZIKV\ninoculations became infected after one ZIKV inoculation. Thus,\nDepoprovera seemed to enhance susceptibility to vaginal ZIKV\ntransmission. Unexpectedly, the kinetics of virus replication and\ndissemination after intravaginal ZIKV inoculation were markedly\ndifferent from RM infected with ZIKV by subcutaneous (SQ) virus\ninoculation. Several groups have reported that after SQ ZIKV\ninoculation vRNA is rapidly detected in blood plasma with vRNA less\ncommon in urine and saliva and only rarely detected in female\nreproductive tract (FRT) secretions. In contrast, in vaginally\ninoculated RM, plasma vRNA is delayed for several days and ZIKV\nreplication in, and vRNA shedding from, the FRT was found in all 6\nanimals. Further, after intravaginal transmission ZIKV RNA shedding\nfrom FRT secretions was detected before or simultaneously with plasma\nvRNA, and persisted for at least as long. Thus, ZIKV replication in\nthe FRT was independent of, and often preceded virus replication in\nthe tissues contributing to plasma vRNA. These results support the\nconclusion that ZIKV preferentially replicates in the FRT after\nvaginal transmission, but not after SQ transmission, and raise the\npossibility that there is enhanced fetal infection and pathology after\nvaginal ZIKV transmission compared to a mosquito transmitted ZIKV. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{10}</strong> _Aedes albopictus_ populations as vectors.\nDate: 2 Aug 2017.\nSource: American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (edited)\n(http://www.ajtmh.org/content/journals/10.4269/ajtmh.16-0969) \nref: Azar SR, Roundy CM, Rossi SL, et al.

Positive saliva samples were assayed for\ninfectious titer. Although all 3 mosquito populations were susceptible\nto all ZIKV strains, rates of infection, dissemination, and\ntransmission differed among mosquito and virus strains. _Aedes\nalbopictus_ from Salvador, Brazil, were the least efficient vectors,\ndemonstrating susceptibility to infection to 2 American strains of\nZIKV but failing to shed virus in saliva. Mosquitoes from the Rio\nGrande Valley were the most efficient vectors and were capable of\nshedding all 3 tested ZIKV strains into saliva after 14 days of\nextrinsic incubation. In particular, ZIKV strain DakAR 41525 (Senegal\n1954) was significantly more efficient at dissemination and saliva\ndeposition than the others tested in Rio Grande mosquitoes.

Emerg Microbes\nInfect. 2017; 6(8): e69. doi: 10.1038/emi.2017.59\n-\nAbstract\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has recently been associated\nwith an increased incidence of neonatal microcephaly and other\nneurological disorders. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito\nbite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some\ncases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main\nvector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other\nmosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the\nvirus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit\nZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of\nlaboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_.\nInterestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the\nmidgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in\nRecife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially\nfed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced.\nCollectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range\nof ZIKV vectors than anticipated. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nRoland Hübner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n(roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be) Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active\nvirus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their\nability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step\ntoward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_\nfed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in\nsaliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx.\nquinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing.\nThe study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a\ncompetent vector. Several other studies have shown this species to be\ninefficient vectors or refractory to Zika virus infection. One wonders\nif the specific _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ used or the Zika virus isolates\nwith which they were tested could account for these very different\nresults. Resolving these discrepancies is important because this\nmosquito species is very widely distributed around the world and bears\ndirectly on risk of outbreaks in geographic areas where _Aedes\naegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_ , Zika virus vectors, do not occur. -\nMod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"52":{"title":"Equine infectious anemia - USA (04): (KS) ","date":["20","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH/EDR> Equine infectious anemia - USA (04): (KS) [EXTERNAL]","summary":" A ProMED-mail post (http://www.promedmail.org) ProMED-mail is a program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases (http://www.isid.org) .

Source: Horsetalk.co.nz (edited) (https://www.horsetalk.co.nz/2017/08/20/six-horses-positive-equine-infectious-anemia-kansas/#axzz4qJ68LWBR)   A horse property in southwest Kansas is under quarantine following confirmation of 6 cases of equine infectious anemia in horses. The infected horses on the property in Finney County will be euthanized because there is no cure and there is a risk the animals may infect other horses.  The Kansas Department of Agriculture's Division of Animal Health was told this month August 2017 of the initial positive test for the disease, also known as Swamp fever. The horse facility was quarantined and all the exposed horses were tested, with 5 additional positive cases detected. The remaining horses at the facility will be observed and retested in 60 days.  Equine infectious anemia is most commonly spread by biting flies and ticks, or sometimes through the shared used of blood-contaminated instruments or needles. The disease does not affect people, but it can be spread to horses, mules and donkeys.  The virus attacks the immune system, with signs including bleeding in mucus membranes and a gradual loss of condition and muscle weakness. Other signs include fever, depression and anemia. Infected horses can run a low-grade fever or become lethargic, but often there are no clinical signs. Infected horses continue to carry the virus and can be the source of further infections, hence the protocol to euthanize infected animals.  All infected horses, including those who have no signs, are carriers of the disease. There is no vaccine or treatment.  There are typically a small number of cases in the United States every year, although the disease is common in other parts of the world. The disease is controlled in the US by regular testing before horses are allowed to travel across state lines and/or to shows.  The pathogen causing the disease is categorized as a lentivirus: it contains genetic RNA material, which it uses to produce DNA. This DNA is then incorporated into the genetic makeup of infected cells.  The disease was first identified in France in 1843 and first tentatively diagnosed in the United States in 1888.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  This seems like a lot of animals to euthanize from one facility and surely horse owners and the facility managers are immensely affected.  How sad that this disease continues and there is no vaccine for it. We pour millions into other research projects, some of which seem to have little usefulness, but why no vaccine?  \"Under natural conditions, the most important mode of transmission of equine infectious anemia (EIA) is by the transfer of virus-infective blood by blood-feeding insects between horses in close proximity. Virus is found free in the plasma or cell associated, principally in monocytes and macrophages of infected animals. Although infection is considered primarily blood borne, all tissues and body fluids are potentially infectious, especially during episodes of clinical disease when viral burdens are high. Transmission of EIA by biting flies is purely mechanical; the virus does not replicate in the vector. The chance of transmission of EIA is directly proportional to the volume of blood retained on the mouthparts of the insect after feeding. In that respect, horse flies, deer flies, and to a lesser extent, stable flies are likely the most efficient vectors. It is also because they are capable of triggering host defensive behavior that interrupts feeding and results in their seeking a new susceptible host to complete their blood meal.\"  Fly control is very important, in the barn and on the animal.  Currently there is no vaccine for EIA in the US. There is a vaccine developed in China and used in other places (see: Equine infectious anemia - USA (04): (KY) unlicensed vaccine http://promedmail.org/post/20150915.3645562).

Source: The Packer (edited) (http://www.thepacker.com/news/fda-sprout-program-halts-outbreak-leads-recalls)   The United States' Food and Drug Administration's 2-year sampling program for sprouts has produced both enforcement actions  prompting 6 product recalls and helping stop an outbreak of listeriosis  and long-term insights on the prevalence of pathogens on sprout seeds and finished product.  The FDA's \"fiscal year 2014-16 microbiological sampling assignment summary report: sprouts\" collected and tested sprouts as part of a \"proactive and preventive approach\" to help protect food safety, according to the report. Samples were tested for salmonella, _Listeria monocytogenes_, and _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7. Collecting 825 samples of domestic product, virtually all fresh sprouts eaten in the United States are grown in the USA, the sampling program tested sprout seeds, fresh sprouts, and spent irrigation water, according to the summary.  FDA's sprout sampling program found: - salmonella was found in 0.21 per cent of the sprouts, 2.35 per cent of seeds and 0.54 per cent of used irrigation water; - _L. monocytogenes_ was in 1.28 per cent of the tested sprouts, similar to the percentage found in seeds and used irrigation water; - no sprouts/spent irrigation water tested positive for _E. coli_ O157:H7. Seeds weren't tested for that strain due to limitations associated with the test method; - samples with pathogens were from a small number of companies, with positives at 8 (8.5 per cent) of the 94 sprouting operations tested;  According to the summary, many firms still have progress to make in sprout safety. \"The fact that the agency found multiple positive samples at some of these operations underscores the need for sprouting operations to comply with the agency's Produce Safety Regulation (published November 2015), which seeks to prevent outbreaks of foodborne illness and improve sprout safety,\" according to the report.  During the testing process, the FDA worked with firms that owned or released the sprouts/seeds to conduct recalls or to have the product destroyed, and then followed up with inspections. The sampling program helped stop a listeriosis outbreak before it spread beyond a few cases, and it also prompted 6 recalls.  While no large-scale testing of sprouts is planned, the FDA will determine if more sampling is needed. Criteria include whether a firm has a history of uncorrected contamination and observations from food safety inspectors who visit the facilities, according to the report. \"The presence of harmful bacteria in the commodity remains a concern to the agency in view of the history of reported outbreaks associated with sprouts, including 5 in 2016, and the fact that this assignment resulted in 6 product recalls,\" it said.  byline: Tom Karst   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  The report \"FY 2014-2016 microbiological sampling assignment summary report: sprouts\" from the FDA's Office of Compliance, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition can be found at (https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/ComplianceEnforcement/Sampling/UCM566981.pdf).  \"Executive summary  \"The FDA set out to collect and test sprouts in 2014 as part of a new proactive and preventive approach to deploying its sampling resources with the ultimate goal of keeping contaminated food from reaching consumers.  \"The new approach, detailed in the Background section of this report (page 4 available at the URL above), centers on the testing of a statistically determined number of samples of targeted foods over a relatively short period of time, 12 to 18 months, to ensure a statistically valid amount of data is available for decision making. This approach helps the agency determine if there are common factors  such as origin, season, or variety  associated with pathogen findings.  \"The FDA issued the sprouts assignment in January 2014 under its new sampling model. The assignment targeted sprouts at 3 points in the production process (seeds, finished product, and spent irrigation water), with the aim of collecting and testing 1600 samples to determine the prevalence of select pathogens in the commodity. As background, the FDA designed its sampling plan such that if contamination of one per cent or greater was present in the commodity, the agency would detect it. The FDA monitored the assignment closely to gather lessons learned and make changes to its sampling procedures if needed to address trends or food safety issues. About one year into the assignment, the FDA decided to stop its collection and testing at 825 samples because it had already collected samples on more than one occasion from many of the sprouting operations known to the agency and its state partners. The sample set acquired was sufficient for the FDA to estimate the bacterial prevalences in the commodity with a 95 percent confidence interval of 0 per cent to 2 per cent for a one percent contamination rate.  \"The FDA tested only domestically grown sprouts for this assignment because virtually all sprouts eaten in the United States are grown domestically due to the commodity's delicate nature and relatively short shelf-life. Of note, the industry features a preponderance of relatively small operations.  \"The FDA tested the sprout samples for 3 pathogens: salmonella, _Listeria monocytogenes_, and _E. coli_ O157:H7. Based on the test results, the FDA found the prevalence of salmonella in the finished product sprouts to be 0.21 per cent. The agency also found that the prevalence of salmonella in seeds (2.35 per cent) was significantly higher than in finished product (0.21 per cent) and in spent irrigation water (0.54 per cent). Based on the test results, the FDA found the prevalence of _L. monocytogenes_ in the finished product to be 1.28 per cent. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of _L. monocytogenes_ based on point in the production process. None of the samples tested positive for _E. coli_ O157:H7. The agency did not test seed for _E. coli_ O157:H7 due to limitations associated with the test method.  \"Among the FDA's other findings, the agency found most of the positive samples at a small number of sprouting operations. Specifically, the FDA found violative samples at eight (8.5 per cent) of the 94 sprouting operations visited for purposes of this assignment. The fact that the agency found multiple positive samples at some of these operations underscores the need for sprouting operations to comply with the agency's Produce Safety Regulation (published November 2015), which seeks to prevent outbreaks of foodborne illness and improve sprout safety.  \"To address the positive samples, the FDA worked with the firms that owned or released the affected product to conduct voluntary recalls or to have their consignees destroy it, and then followed up with inspections. Of particular note, this sampling assignment helped detect and stop an outbreak of listeriosis while it still entailed a small number of cases, as described in the public health Impact section of this report (page 14 available at the URL above). This assignment also prompted 6 product recalls.  \"The FDA will continue to consider microbial contamination of sprouts and how best to reduce it. Such contamination remains a concern to the FDA given the aforementioned outbreak and the recalls initiated. Going forward, the FDA intends to inspect sprouting operations to ensure they are complying, as applicable, with the Produce Safety Rule, which includes new requirements for sprouts growers. The agency has no plans to conduct additional large-scale sampling of sprouts at this time but may sample the commodity in accordance with its longstanding approach to food sampling, which centers on (but is not limited to) the following criteria: - a firm has a previous history of unmitigated microbial contamination in the environment (such as, human illness, recalled or seized product, previous inspectional history, or environmental pathogens without proper corrective actions by the facility), or - inspectional observations that warrant collection of samples for microbiological analyses.\" - Mod.LL  A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: (http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106).

Source: The Horse (edited) (http://www.thehorse.com/articles/39611/equine-infectious-anemia-found-in-north-carolina-mule)   A 14 year old female mule in Johnston county, North Carolina, has tested positive for equine infectious anemia (EIA). The disease was discovered during a routine blood test by the North Carolina Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, in Raleigh, and confirmed by the USDA United States Department of Agriculture. This is the 1st new case of EIA documented in North Carolina since 2005.  \"The Johnston County facility is under a quarantine order that restricts movement of equines until further testing is completed by the NC Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services,\" said Michael Neault, DVM, director of livestock and animal health programs. \"Because the disease is not curable, the affected mule has been euthanized. The remaining equines at the facility were tested and were negative for EIA. They will be observed and retested in 60 days, and we are monitoring neighboring facilities for the disease.\"  Equine infectious anemia is an incurable disease most commonly spread between equids  such as horses, mules, and donkeys  in close proximity to biting flies and ticks. Clinical signs of EIA include fever, weakness, weight loss, anemia, edema, and death; however, not all affected equids show clinical signs. All infected equids, including those that are asymptomatic, are carriers of the disease.  There are typically a small number of EIA cases in the United States every year, although the disease is common in other parts of the world. The disease is controlled in the United States by regular testing before traveling across state lines, exhibition, and other events. A Coggins test screens horses' blood for antibodies that are indicative of the presence of EIA.  There is no approved vaccine for EIA in the United States. To help prevent infection, owners can: - use sterile, disposable needles and syringes, one per horse, for all vaccines and medications; - test all horses for EIA every year, and at the time they enter a new premises; - keep stables and other facilities sanitary. Regularly clean stalls and properly dispose of manure away from horse stabling areas; - implement approved insect controls, such as insecticides and good drainage of standing water, to minimize fly presence; - only participate in events that require evidence of negative Coggins test for every equine entering the event to prevent disease introduction and spread; - isolate new horses on a property until they are tested for EIA; - never mix infected and healthy animals. Do not breed horses infected with EIA; and - follow state laws covering EIA.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  How sad that this disease continues and there is no vaccine for it. We pour millions into other research projects, some of which seem to have little value, but why no vaccine?  \"Under natural conditions, the most important mode of transmission of equine infectious anemia (EIA) is by the transfer of virus-infective blood by blood-feeding insects between horses in close proximity. Virus is found free in the plasma or cell associated, principally in monocytes and macrophages of infected animals. Although infection is considered primarily blood borne, all tissues and body fluids are potentially infectious, especially during episodes of clinical disease when viral burdens are high. Transmission of EIA by biting flies is purely mechanical; the virus does not replicate in the vector. The chance of transmission of EIA is directly proportional to the volume of blood retained on the mouthparts of the insect after feeding. In that respect, horse flies, deer flies, and to a lesser extent, stable flies are likely the most efficient vectors. It is also because they are capable of triggering host defensive behavior that interrupts feeding and results in their seeking a new susceptible host to complete their blood meal.\"  Fly control is very important, in the barn and on the animal.  Currently there is no vaccine for EIA in the US. There is a vaccine developed in China and used in other places (see Equine infectious anemia - USA (04): (KY) unlicensed vaccine http://promedmail.org/post/20150915.3645562).

Mod.JG, edited (https://goo.gl/8k5UZP)   Last weekend, more than 20 children with severe respiratory symptoms were admitted to the Regional Hospital, and they were diagnosed with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection.  During the last week, 2 3-year-old children with severe respiratory illness were admitted to the intensive care unit, and one of them was waiting to be referred to Puerto Montt.  Therefore, with information updated until last Sat 26 Aug 2017, more than 30 children with RSV infection have been reported, and all of them are hospitalized in pediatrics, pediatric intensive care, and neonatal intensive care units. Meanwhile, because of the severity of their condition  most of them being infants  7 children have been referred to hospitals in Santiago and Concepcion so they may receive adequate care, since Coyhaique Regional Hospital (CRH) does not have a pediatric intensive care unit (ICU).  This is what Dr. Jaime Lopez-Quintana, Head of the CRH reported: \"This year 2017, RSV is behaving quite aggressively, and our adult intensive care unit is completely full with children. This is not an adequate condition for taking care of these children; this is not what our children in this region deserve,\" as he reported this situation to Ms. Gisela Alarcon-Rojas, Subsecretary of Healthcare Networks of the Chilean Ministry of Health, who verified the condition of children being taken care of in the (adult) ICU.  So, with this complex situation, Dr. Lopez-Quintana added that specialists from important children referral centers, particularly from Dr. Luis Calvo-Mackenna and Dr. Exequiel Fernandez-Cortes hospitals, will soon arrive to this region. \"We hope to have for the next 2 weeks the support of pediatricians trained in intensive medicine who may help the team we have here in Coyhaique,\" emphasized Dr. Lopez-Quintana.  According to information brought by the medical sub-direction from the Coyhaique Regional Hospital, the affected children are hospitalized in the following areas: pediatrics, neonatal intensive care unit, and (general) intensive care unit.  There are 10 infants hospitalized in the pediatrics service, while another 11 children have already been discharged; so now there are 14 beds available. In the neonatal ICU, 7 children are hospitalized; 2 of them are severely ill, and the capacity of the unit is 2 beds; while in the general ICU, 6 infants are hospitalized, and there are 2 beds available.  \"With respect to bed availability, the hospital is still able to cope with the situation. However, a working overload for the personnel has been observed, so that extra personnel have been recruited to cover the work shifts,\" explained Dr. Joaquin Garcia-Gay, Medical Subdirector of the CRH.  Also, Dr. Garcia-Gay explained that if a child develops a febrile illness, respiratory distress, intercostal retraction and malaise for 2 days, these are some of the symptoms that may indicate the presence of RSV, which mainly affects infants less than 2 years old.  \"So, if such symptoms occur, then the child must be brought to the Urgency Service. However, for those patients that develop mild respiratory symptoms, such as common cold or other similar conditions, it is preferable they are not brought to the Urgency Service, since they may be at risk for becoming infected with RSV from patients that are being hospitalized,\" the specialist advised.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. from HealthMap Alerts (promed@promedmail.org)  RSV is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections among young children worldwide. Most infants are infected before one year of age, and virtually everyone gets an RSV infection by 2 years of age.  Each year, on average, in the United States, RSV leads to: - 57 527 hospitalizations among children younger than 5 years old - 2.1 million outpatient visits among children younger than 5 years old - 177 000 hospitalizations and 14 000 deaths among adults older than 65 years.  In the United States and other areas with similar climates, RSV infections occur primarily during fall, winter, and spring (https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/research/us-surveillance.html). It is currently winter in Chile.  It is not clear what may have led to this current RSV outbreak in Chile. In 2001, an outbreak of RSV struck Santiago, Chile. 150 hospital admissions were registered daily during the height of the southern hemisphere winter. It was speculated that pollution may have played a role as Santiago is one of the world's most polluted cities. Chile's geography of surrounding mountains and heat inversions in winter dramatically increases the concentration of pollutants. Pollution leads to irritation of the respiratory tract making it more difficult for the immune system to respond to infections. (Excerpted from C Orellana.

Illnesses started on dates ranging from 1 Mar 2017 to 3 Aug 2017. Of 33 people with available information, 16 have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. 12 (32 percent) ill people are children 5 years of age or younger.  States / Case count California / 1 Connecticut / 3 Illinois / 4 Louisiana / 2 Maryland / 2 Massachusetts / 2 Mississippi / 1 New Jersey / 1 New York / 11 Ohio / 3 Pennsylvania / 5 Texas / 1 Washington / 1 Total / 37  Epidemiologic and laboratory findings link the outbreak of human _Salmonella_ Agbeni infections to contact with turtles or their environments, such as water from a turtle habitat. In interviews, ill people answered questions about contact with animals during the week before becoming ill. 15 (45 percent) of the 33 people interviewed reported contact with turtles or their environments, such as water from a turtle habitat, before getting sick. In interviews with 9 ill people about where their turtles came from, 6 reported buying a turtle from a flea market or street vendor, or receiving the turtle as a gift.  In 2015, state and local health officials collected samples from turtles at a street vendor. Whole genome sequencing showed that the _Salmonella_ Agbeni isolated from ill people in this outbreak is closely related genetically to the _S._ Agbeni isolates from turtles. This close genetic relationship means that people in this outbreak are more likely to share a common source of infection.  Do not buy small turtles as pets or give them as gifts. Since 1975, the FDA has banned selling and distributing turtles with shells less than 4 inches long as pets because they are often linked to _Salmonella_ infections, especially in young children. All turtles, regardless of size, can carry _Salmonella_ bacteria even if they look healthy and clean. These outbreaks are a reminder to follow simple steps to enjoy pet reptiles and keep your family healthy.  This outbreak is expected to continue since consumers might be unaware of the risk of _Salmonella_ infection from small turtles. If properly cared for, turtles have a long life expectancy.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  In 2008, CDC reported on an ongoing outbreak of _S._ Paratyphi B var. Java (CDC: _Salmonella_ Infections Associated with Exposure to Turtles  USA, 2007-2008. Morbid Mortal Weekly Rep 2008; 57(03): 69-72; (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5703a3.htm). Some of the discussion of the report is reproduced below:  \"The prohibition on the sale and distribution of small turtles was enacted in 1975, after public health investigations demonstrated that small turtles were a major source of human _Salmonella_ infections, particularly in children. In 1972, a study in New Jersey indicated that small pet turtles accounted for approximately 23 percent of _Salmonella_ infections in children (4). In 1980, the 1975 prohibition was estimated to have prevented 100 000 _Salmonella_ infections in American children each year since going into effect (5). However, this prohibition has an exception: small turtles may be sold legally for scientific, educational, or exhibition purposes. During 2001-2006, the number of turtles kept as pets in the USA increased 86 percent to nearly 2 million turtles (6), suggesting that this exception might provide a mechanism by which small turtles become household pets.  \"Turtles, like other reptiles, commonly carry _Salmonella_, and fecal carriage rates can be as high as 90 percent (1). Small turtles sold as pets frequently come from breeding farms, where turtles are housed in crowded ponds and nesting areas in a way that promotes _Salmonella_ transmission (7). Attempts to treat turtles, turtle eggs, and turtle breeding ponds with antibiotics to eliminate _Salmonella_ have not been successful and have resulted in a high prevalence of antibiotic resistance (7,8). Other treatments reduce but do not eliminate shedding from turtles (8), and the turtles that continue to shed might recontaminate other turtles during rearing or shipment. Because shedding might be intermittent and stress related, determining whether turtles are free of the bacteria is difficult (1).  \"Direct or indirect contact with a reptile is associated with an estimated 6 percent of human salmonellosis in the USA (9). Persons coming into contact with reptiles, reptile habitats, or surfaces contaminated with reptile fecal matter risk infection from salmonellae shed by the reptile (10). Although most reptiles carry _Salmonella_, small turtles are likely to be handled differently than other reptiles and thus carry a greater risk of transmitting _Salmonella_ to children. In contrast to the obvious risk for a bite or scratch, for example, from a snake or an iguana, a small turtle is likely to be perceived as safe, and thus might be given directly to small children to play with. In addition, a young child placed in charge of caring for a turtle has direct contact with water in the turtle habitat, where salmonellae are likely to multiply to high numbers. Although approximately half of the infections associated with this outbreak occurred in young children, who are at greater risk for severe illness from salmonellosis (2,10), several illnesses occurred in adults with turtle exposure, demonstrating that turtle-associated salmonellosis is not unique to children. Additionally, only 20 percent of case-patients interviewed reported awareness of the link between salmonellosis and contact with reptiles, indicating that measures to educate the public about this link have not been successful. CDC has provided recommendations to prevent reptile-associated salmonellosis in humans (2). However, because of the particular hazard associated with small turtles, prohibiting the sale and distribution of small turtles likely remains the most effective public health action to prevent turtle-associated salmonellosis.

The recent outbreaks of ZIKV in Brazil and French\nPolynesia have been linked to a considerable increase in the incidence\nof fetal microcephaly and other diseases such as Guillain-Barre\nsyndrome. Because there is currently no specific therapy or vaccine,\nthe early exploitation of a method to prevent expansion of ZIKV is a\nhigh priority. To validate commonly used antiviral drugs, we evaluated\nthe effect of ribavirin, a drug used to treat hepatitis C with\ninterferon-beta (IFN-beta), on ZIKV replication. In mammalian cells,\nwe observed an inhibitory effect of ribavirin on ZIKV replication and\nZIKV-induced cell death without cytotoxic effect. Furthermore, we\nfound that STAT1-deficient mice, which lack type I IFN signaling, were\nhighly sensitive to ZIKV infection and exhibited lethal outcome.\nRibavirin abrogated viremia in ZIKV-infected STAT-1-deficient mice.\nThese data suggest that the inhibition of viral RNA-dependent RNA\npolymerases may be effective for treatment of ZIKV infection. Our data\nprovide a new insight into the mechanisms for inhibition of ZIKV\nreplication and prevention of Zika fever. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) It will be interesting to see if these encouraging results showing\ninhibition of Zika virus replication can be replicated in non-human\nprimates. The challenge for use of drugs to inhibit Zika virus\ninfection in humans is that most (around 80 percent) Zika virus\ninfections are asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms. These\nindividuals will probably not seek medical treatment, even though\ntheir fetuses are at risk of infection with teratogenic effects. -\nMod.TY \n<br><br><strong>{3}</strong> Zika virus skewed immunosuppression.\nDate: Mon 21 Aug 2017.\nSource: Nature Microbiology journal (edited)\n(http://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-017-0016-3) \nref: Foo SS, Chen W, Chan Y, et al.

Nat Microbiol. 2017. doi: 10.1038/s41564-017-0016-3\n-\nAbstract\nBlood CD14+ monocytes are frontline immunomodulators categorized into\nclassical, intermediate or non-classical subsets, and subsequently\ndifferentiated into M1 pro- or M2 anti-inflammatory macrophages on\nstimulation. Although the Zika virus (ZIKV) rapidly establishes\nviraemia, the target cells and immune responses, particularly during\npregnancy, remain elusive. Furthermore, it is unknown whether African-\nand Asian-lineage ZIKV have different phenotypic impacts on host\nimmune responses. Using human blood infection, we identified CD14+\nmonocytes as the primary target for African- or Asian-lineage ZIKV\ninfection. When immunoprofiles of human blood infected with ZIKV were\ncompared, a classical/intermediate monocyte-mediated M1-skewed\ninflammation by the African-lineage ZIKV infection was observed, in\ncontrast to a non-classical monocyte-mediated M2-skewed\nimmunosuppression by the Asian-lineage ZIKV infection. Importantly,\ninfection of the blood of pregnant women revealed an enhanced\nsusceptibility to ZIKV infection. Specifically, Asian-lineage ZIKV\ninfection of pregnant women's blood led to an exacerbated M2-skewed\nimmunosuppression of non-classical monocytes in conjunction with a\nglobal suppression of type I interferon-signaling pathway and an\naberrant expression of host genes associated with pregnancy\ncomplications. Also, 30 ZIKV+ sera from symptomatic pregnant patients\nshowed elevated levels of M2-skewed immunosuppressive cytokines and\npregnancy-complication-associated fibronectin-1. This study\ndemonstrates the differential immunomodulatory responses of blood\nmonocytes, particularly during pregnancy, on infection with different\nlineages of ZIKV. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n(promed@promedmail.org) \n<br><br><strong>{4}</strong> Virus alters mosquito genes.\nDate: Tue 22 Aug 2017.\nSource: bioRxiv journal (edited)\n(http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/22/179416) \nref: Etebari K, Hegde S, Saldana MA, et al. Global transcriptome\nanalysis of _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes in response to Zika virus\ninfection. bioRxiv 179416; doi:10.1101/179416\n-\nZika virus (ZIKV) of the Flaviviridae family is a recently emerged\nmosquito-borne virus that has been implicated in the surge of the\nnumber of microcephaly instances in South America. The recent rapid\nspread of the virus led to its declaration as a global health\nemergency by the World Health Organization. The virus is transmitted\nmainly by the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_ that also vectors dengue virus,\nhowever little is known about the interactions of the virus with the\nmosquito vector. In this study, we investigated the transcriptome\nprofiles of whole _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes in response to ZIKV\ninfection at 2, 7, and 14 days post-infection using RNA-Seq. Results\nshowed changes in the abundance of a large number of transcripts at\neach time point following infection, with 18 transcripts commonly\nchanged among the 3 time points. Gene ontology analysis revealed that\nmost of the altered genes are involved in metabolic process, cellular\nprocess and proteolysis. In addition, 486 long intergenic non-coding\nRNAs were identified altered upon ZIKV infection. Further, we found\ncorrelational changes of a number of potential mRNA target genes with\nthat of altered host microRNAs. The outcomes provide a basic\nunderstanding of _Ae. aegypti_ responses to ZIKV and helps to\ndetermine host factors involved in replication or mosquito host\nanti-viral response against the virus. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) Mosquito vector competence depends on the relationship of virus and\nthe mosquito, and the defenses that the mosquito can mobilize against\nthe virus infection. Studies, such as the one above, can document the\nchanges that occur when the virus infects the mosquito, and if\ndifferences in relative vector efficiency of different geographic\nstrains of this mosquito might be related to alternations in mosquito\ngenes when infected. It would be interesting to know if these gene\nchanges affect fitness, and especially longevity of infected\nmosquitoes. - Mod.TY \n<br><br><strong>{5}</strong> Virus effects on sperm, body fluids.\nDate: Mon 21 Aug 2017.\nSource: The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal (edited)\n(http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(17)30444-9/abstract) \nref: Joguet G, Mansuy JM, Matusali G, et al.

To investigate the effects of Zika\nvirus infection on semen and clearance of Zika virus from semen and\nbody fluids, we aimed to study a cohort of Zika virus-infected men. Methods\nThis prospective observational study recruited men presenting with\nacute Zika virus infection at Pointe-Ã -Pitre University Hospital in\nGuadeloupe, French Caribbean, where a Zika virus outbreak occurred\nbetween April and November, 2016. Blood, urine, and semen were\ncollected at days 7, 11, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 after symptom onset,\nand semen characteristics, such as total sperm count, sperm motility,\nvitality, and morphology, and reproductive hormone concentrations,\nsuch as testosterone, inhibin, follicle-stimulating hormone, and\nluteinising hormone, were assessed. At days 7, 11, and 20, semen was\nprocessed to isolate motile spermatozoa. Zika virus RNA was detected\nby RT-PCR using whole blood, serum, urine, seminal plasma, semen\ncells, and motile spermatozoa fractions. Zika virus was isolated from\ndifferent sperm fractions on Vero E6 cultures. Findings\n15 male volunteers (mean age 35 years SD 5; range 25-44) with acute\nZika virus infection and positive Zika virus RNA detection in blood or\nurine were enrolled. Total sperm count was decreased from median\n119âÃâ10^6 spermatozoa (IQR interquartile range 22-234)\nat day 7, to 45.2âÃâ10^6 (16.5-89.6) at day 30, and 70\nÃ 10^6 (28.5-81.4) at day 60, respectively, after Zika virus\ninfection. Inhibin values increased from 93.5 pg/mL (IQR 55-162) at\nday 7 to 150 pg/mL (78-209) at day 120 when total sperm count\nrecovered. In motile spermatozoa obtained after density gradient\nseparation, Zika virus RNA was found in 3 of 14 patients at day 7, 4\nof 15 at day 11, and 4 of 15 at day 20, and replication-competent\nvirus was found in the tested patient. Seminal shedding kinetics\nseemed heterogeneous among patients. Whole blood was the fluid most\nfrequently positive for Zika virus RNA (62 of 92 samples) and 3\npatients remained positive at day 120. Interpretation\nSemen alterations early after acute Zika virus infection might affect\nfertility and could be explained by virus effects on the testis and\nepididymis. Frequency of shedding and high viral load in semen,\ntogether with the presence of replicative virus in a motile\nspermatozoa fraction, can lead to Zika virus transmission during\nsexual contact and assisted reproduction procedures. Whole blood seems\nto be the best specimen for Zika virus RNA detection, diagnosis, and\nfollow-up. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall In a new study that included 12 men in French Guiana who had Zika\nvirus, 4 never had any detectable Zika in their semen, 1 excreted Zika\nvirus in his semen for at least 3 days, and 7 had Zika virus in semen\nfor at least 1 month.

JAMA. 2017; 318(8):\n689. doi:10.1001/jama.2017.11200\n-\nResearchers funded in part by the National Institutes of Health have\nrecently demonstrated that 2 experimental vaccines can restrict\ntransmission of Zika virus from pregnant mice to their fetuses,\nthereby shielding offspring from congenital damage or death. Multiple candidate Zika vaccines have been shown protective against\ninfection with the virus in animal studies, with several now in human\ntrials, but none were tested in the context of pregnancy, according to\nthe authors of the study published in Cell\n(http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(17)30759-6). The 2\nvaccine candidates investigated in the new study are the 1st to\ndemonstrate efficacy in preventing vertical transmission of the virus\nand related fetal death in an animal model. Although the vaccines were\nadministered to female mice prior to pregnancy, the result is\nconsidered an important step toward developing a vaccine that could be\nsafely given to pregnant women. One of the 2 candidates is a modified messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine\nencoding Zika genes, developed by the biotechnology company Moderna.\nIt is already in safety trials in women who are not pregnant. The\nother is a live-attenuated Zika strain developed by researchers at the\nUniversity of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). The testing was carried out by scientists from the National Institute\nof Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Washington University School of\nMedicine, and UTMB. The researchers 1st vaccinated the mice with 1 of\nthe vaccines or a placebo. After mating, the animals were challenged\nwith the virus 6 days into pregnancy. A week later, more than 50\npercent of placentas and fetuses from mice administered the mRNA\nvaccine had virtually no Zika RNA. The remainder had \"substantially\nlower\" levels relative to placebo.\nThe live vaccine provided broader protection: 78 percent of placentas\nand 83 percent of fetuses had Zika RNA at or below the level of\ndetection, while the placebo group exhibited significantly higher\nlevels of placental and fetal Zika RNA. Mice vaccinated with either\nvaccine had significantly higher rates of fetal viability; whereas 100\npercent of fetuses from mice vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine were\nborn, none survived to term in the placebo group. A working group funded by the Wellcome Trust recently approved ethical\nguidelines for testing such vaccines in pregnant women, normally\nexcluded from drug trials. \n<br><br>Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n(promed@promedmail.org) It is reassuring to learn that at least 2 vaccines are now entering\nclinical trials in women. Although anti-Zika virus drugs are under\ndevelopment, preventing infection through vaccination seems to be the\nmost effective measure to prevent fetal infection and adverse effects\nof the virus infection in adults. - Mod.TY ","keywordsMatched":[]},"180":{"title":"Eastern equine encephalitis - USA (08): (GA, OH) equine\r\n\t","date":["31","Aug","2017"],"url":"promedPRO/AH/EDR> Eastern equine encephalitis - USA (08): (GA, OH) equine\r\n\t[EXTERNAL]","summary":" A ProMED-mail post (http://www.promedmail.org) ProMED-mail is a program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases (http://www.isid.org)  In this update: <br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Georgia <br><br><strong>{2}</strong> Ohio   <br><br><strong>{1}</strong> Georgia.

Date: Thu 31 Aug 2017. From: Michael J. Bangs (mbangs@fmi.com) (edited)   It stands to reason that the presence of _Anopheles farauti_ as the new entrant into New Caledonia is presumably recent. The nearest neighbor is Vanuatu, a malaria-endemic country that has but one anopheline species present in that island group, _Anopheles farauti_ sensu stricto, an effective malaria vector provided you add _Plasmodium_ to the mix.  _Anopheles farauti_ is one member of 8 known sibling species in the _Farauti_ Complex (closely related species that are morphologically identical, thus confounding accurate identification without the use of molecular techniques). It is by far the most widely distributed species in the complex in the southwest Pacific region (Maluku island group, eastern Indonesia to northern Australia, PNG, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu). The species' ability to inhabit brackish water environments (predominantly a coastal inhabitant) has aided in its dispersal throughout the region.  The origin of the anopheline population in New Caledonia might remain a mystery, but this discovery is of concern. If the area of establishment is relatively confined, it might be possible to eliminate this species before it extends further into the country. Foremost, identify the species.   Michael J. Bangs, MSPH, PhD. Public Health & Malaria Control International SOS Kuala Kencana, Papua, Indonesia (mbangs@fmi.com)  ProMED thanks Dr. Bangs for his comments.  The _Anopheles_ reported in the previous posting was found in an area of La Tontouta, north of Noumea. One hopes that the area of discovery is small enough to permit control.

Source: Al Arabiya (edited) (http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/gulf/2017/08/20/Cholera-death-toll-in-Yemen-rises-to-1997.html)   WHO has announced another 22 deaths within the last 5 days caused by cholera in Yemen. The reported numbers affirm a total of 1997 deaths starting from the end of April 2017. As of Saturday evening 19 Aug 2017, the number of cholera cases stands at 527 000.  The WHO report also noted that Yemen's Sanaa and Al Hudaydah governorate, located in the west of the country, have the highest rates of cholera spread compared with other governorates. The combined number of infected individuals in the two areas stands at 62 000. The Hajjah governorate has maintained the highest number of cholera related deaths reported at 381.  Meanwhile, the United Nations has raised the Humanitarian Response Plan budget to address the Yemeni crisis. The new budget is placed at USD 370 million. Despite the critical situation in Yemen and the spread of cholera, the international organization said that only 33 per cent of the required funds have been provided by donors, most notably Saudi Arabia.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  Although a number of sources had reported decreasing numbers of daily cases, the new numbers seem to support the continuing robust number of daily cases.

Source: Anadolu Agency (edited) (http://aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/cholera-has-killed-2-018-people-in-yemen-who/894568)   A total of 2018 people have been killed by a cholera epidemic in war-torn Yemen since late April 2017, the WHO said Sat 26 Aug 2017.  In a statement, the WHO said 565 041 suspected cases of cholera have been recorded in the country since 27 Apr 2017. According to the WHO statement, the recorded suspected cases were in 22 out of 23 provinces. The UN agency said the highest number of fatalities, 382 cases, was recorded in the northwestern Hajjah province, while in western Yemen's Hudaida province only around 70 000 suspected cases were recorded.  Impoverished Yemen has remained in a state of civil war since 2014, when Houthi rebels overran much of the country, including the capital Sanaa. The conflict escalated when Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies launched a massive air campaign in 2015 aimed at reversing Houthi military gains and shoring up Yemen's embattled government.  According to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), over 3 million people have fled their homes since the onset of the Yemen conflict, and more than 20 million throughout the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.

Date: Fri 1 Sep 2017. Source: Save the Children (edited) (http://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/alarming-cholera-spike-yemen-coastal-region)   An outbreak of cholera has spiked dramatically in several areas of Yemen, including its largest governorate of Hodeidah, Save the Children is warning.  \nRecent health figures from the WHO reveal a far more mixed picture than reports of a nationwide slow-down have previously suggested.  In the coastal Hodeidah Governorate, where the charity runs malnutrition and cholera treatment centres, suspected cholera cases have jumped by 40 percent over the past 3 weeks amid heavy rains and a heat wave. Some districts are now reporting weekly caseload figures more than double their previous peaks. Hodeidah also has some of the worst malnutrition rates in the country, with an estimated one in 4 children under the age of 5 suffering from acute malnutrition. Save the Children has previously warned of the deadly link between hunger and cholera, with malnourished children at least 3 times more likely to die from diarrhoeal diseases.  Neighboring Raymah Governorate has seen an 18 percent increase in suspected cases over the past 3 weeks, while the southern port of Aden has seen a 12 percent jump.  James Denselow, Head of Conflict and Humanitarian Policy at Save the Children, said: \"This epidemic has spread at a frightening rate, and it's clear we're far from seeing the end of it. Given the ongoing bombing, and restrictions on bringing life-saving aid into the country, aid agencies are struggling to get cholera under control. Just when we think we've got it under control in one area, it suddenly spikes elsewhere.\"  \"We need to get more medical supplies, fuel and food into Yemen and to the children who need it without delay. The warring parties that are obstructing the country's ports, roads and airspace are directly responsible for this cholera outbreak and must immediately facilitate humanitarian relief.\"  Suspected cholera cases nationwide have declined from a peak of about 50 000 weekly cases at the end of June 2017 - but that drop stalled 3 weeks ago. Levels now remain at about 35 000 new cases every week.  In the last 4 months, there have been more than 591 100 suspected cases of cholera and 2035 deaths, according to WHO figures from Wed 30 Aug 2017.  \nChildren make up an increasing proportion of both suspected cases and deaths - representing 54 percent of cholera infections and nearly a 3rd of all deaths.   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail.

With the continue hostilities in Yemen and the onset of the rainy season, whatever is being reported as a decrease in cases will likely and perhaps dramatically reversed.

She had returned from Zambia on Wed 9 Aug 2017. The last 7 days before the return flight were spent in the South Luangwa National Park (northern aspect), together with her husband. They went on game tours and described the area as being very wet due to a comparatively heavy rain season. She recalled several bites by tsetse flies during the time spent there.  She presented to the Frankfurt University hospital emergency department on 16 Aug 2017 and blood was immediately taken and examined for parasites. Trypanosomes could be seen in a QBC microscopy and a thin film. Treatment with suramin was initiated and the case was brought to the attention of the WHO.  The patient is suffering from human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), East African form. Her symptoms consisted of fever, headache, muscle aches and a very notable eschar. The patient had a remarkable pancytopenia initially.  According the WHO, 8 cases of HAT were reported in Zambia in 2015 ((http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.A1637)). In 2015, a case of HAT was reported in a Canadian tourist who had also visited South Luangwa National Park ((http://www.promedmail.org/post/http://promedmail.org/post/20150904.3625005)).  Another 3 cases were described on ProMED-mail in 2010, all of which had visited South Luangwa NP http://promedmail.org/post/20101111.4093, http://promedmail.org/post/20101022.3833, and http://promedmail.org/post/20100915.3338  HAT is repeatedly affecting travelers to the African subcontinent, when they are exposed to tsetse flies.

Zambia is endemic for African trypanosomiasis caused by _Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense_. A map of areas in Zambia where there is trypanosomiasis can be found at (http://www.who.int/trypanosomiasis_african/country/Zambia_whole_1014.jpg).  An update of the distribution up to 2014 was recently published: \"Franco JR et al. Monitoring the elimination of human African trypanosomiasis: Update to 2014.

Routine vaccinations in these areas are now long overdue. Mixing of cattle and buffaloes is being exacerbated by the shortage of grazing pastures. All the infected districts have been placed under quarantine with veterinary check-points also manned by police personnel placed at strategic areas to prevent cattle movement. Inspections and community education campaigns are currently on-going.  Control measures Measures applied: movement control inside the country, vaccination in response to the outbreak(s), surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone, surveillance within containment and/or protection zone, traceability, quarantine, control of wildlife reservoirs, zoning, no treatment of affected animals Measures to be applied: no other measures  Diagnostic test results Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result Central Veterinary Laboratory (national laboratory) / Cattle / antibody detection ELISA / 25 Jul 2017 / Positive Botswana Vaccine Institute (OIE reference laboratory) / Cattle / virus isolation / Pending Future reporting The event is continuing.

Date: Wed 6 Sep 2017. Source: AllAfrica, The Herald report (edited) (http://allafrica.com/stories/201709060179.html)   The country has contained an anthrax outbreak that killed one person and infected 56 in April this year 2017, when villagers in Binga Matabeleland North ate meat from infected dead hippos. According to the Ministry of Health and Child Care, no new cases of anthrax have been reported since June 2017. \"The Ministry of Health and Child Care weekly disease surveillance report revealed that no new suspected cases of anthrax were reported during the week ending 20 Aug 2017,\" reads the report.  \"The cumulative figures for anthrax are 57 cases and one death.\" Anthrax is a life-threatening infectious disease caused by bacteria that normally affects animals.  Anthrax-infected hippos started dying from 27 Mar 2017 and some people ate meat from their carcasses after they were found dead in Binga's Mlibizi area.  Chief Saba of Binga had urged the Government to help urgently contain the anthrax outbreak which killed one person and 16 hippos in his area. He said many people including his family ate meat from the dead hippos.  Byline: Thandeka Moyo   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail. (promed@promedmail.org)  There is no mention of further wildlife deaths so I think we can presume that Mr Moyo's claim of containment refers only to the human cases. Interestingly, the previous report (11 May 2017 Anthrax - Zimbabwe (06): (MN) human, wildlife http://promedmail.org/post/20170511.5028820) referred to 2 human deaths, 21 hippos dying (not 16), plus 2 young crocodiles. The absence of any comments on the specifics of wildlife losses probably comes about from reliance being placed on the update report from the Ministry of Health and Child Care.
