Zika virus (or Zika) has been reported in the Marshall Islands. Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in the Marshall Islands are infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:  Women who are pregnant:  Do not travel to the Marshall Islands.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to the Marshall Islands or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.

Approximately 70 percent of the cases have been among people who are homeless, use illicit drugs, or a combination of those 2 factors. The county has been increasing efforts to vaccinate these target populations as well as those who come in contact with them. The county's public health officer has now made recommendations that people who handle food get a vaccination for hepatitis A. \"This is a proactive recommendation because the ongoing outbreak means that the risk to the general public is higher than normal,\" said Wilma Wooten, MD, MPH, county public health officer. \"A person who becomes infected with hepatitis A may spread the disease to others before experiencing symptoms. In an occupation such as handling food, workers may expose more members of the public than workers in other occupations.\" No common sources of food, beverage, or drugs have been identified that have contributed to this outbreak, although the investigation continues. Food handlers can get the vaccination from their occupational health provider, health care provider, or a local pharmacy that carries the vaccine. A prescription is not needed to get the vaccination. The vaccine is also available to uninsured or under-insured individuals for no cost at all county public health centers. For a list of locations, call 2-1-1 or visit SDIZ.org. The vaccine recommendation has also been expanded to those who work in health care in addition to prior recommendations for those who work in public safety, sanitation, homeless shelters and behavioral and homeless service providers. A hepatitis A vaccination is the best way to prevent the disease. HHSA is continuing to work with a wide range of community partners on a variety of strategies to offer vaccinations and deploy increased education efforts to people at risk for getting hepatitis A. Homeless service providers, treatment providers, faith-based community organizations and the Regional Task Force on Homeless are all helping notify high-risk individuals about the outbreak. Ads encouraging people get the hepatitis A vaccine have been placed in Metro Transit buses, trolleys and stops. The local medical community, including hospital emergency departments and community health clinics, and the county jail and probation facilities, have been helping administer vaccinations. Teams of public health nurses, often partnered with a community outreach worker or a member of law enforcement through the various Homeless Outreach Teams, are continuing to go into the community on \"foot teams\" to offer homeless people vaccinations. Hepatitis A is most commonly spread person-to-person through the fecal-oral route. Symptoms of hepatitis A include jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, and light-colored stools. Symptoms usually appear over a number of days and last less than 2 months. However, some people can be ill for as long as 6 months. Hepatitis A can sometimes cause liver failure and even death. Hepatitis A can also be prevented through good hygiene. Everyone should: - Wash their hands for 20 seconds (about the length of time to sing \"Happy Birthday\" twice) with soap and running water before eating and after using the restroom or changing a diaper. - Do not directly touch the door handle when exiting a public restroom. - Do not share food, drinks, or smoking materials with other people. Byline: Tom Christensen  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Rapporteur Mary Marshall The number of cases of diagnosed hepatitis A (HAV) in San Diego County in southern California continues to increase.<br><br><strong> Date / Cases / Hospitalized (percentage) / Deaths (percentage) -</strong><br> 5 Apr 2017 / 39 / 33 (85) / 1 (3) 4 May 2017 / 80 / 66 (83) / 3 (4) 31 May 2017 / 133 / 103 (80) / 3 (2) 12 Jun 2017 / 160 / 120 (75) / 4 (2.5) 27 Jun 2017 / 196 / 142 (72) / 4 (2) 26 Jul 2017 / 275 / 194 (71) / 7 (2.5) 1 Aug 2017 / 295 / 202 (68) / 10 (3.4) 8 Aug 2017 / 312 / 215 (69) / 10 (3.2) 15 Aug 2017 / 333 / 232 (70) / 11 (3.3) 22 Aug 2017 / 352 / 246 (70) / 14 (4) 29 Aug 2017 / 378 / 263 (70) / 15 (4) In the past week, 26 cases have been reported with 1 more death. Since many cases of HAV infection are asymptomatic or anicteric (without jaundice), the total number of cases is likely to have been significantly higher. The epicurve published last week (Hepatitis A - USA (20): (CA) fatal http://promedmail.org/post/20170817.5256184) showed that the outbreak is continuing at a relatively stable rate of 15-20 new onset cases/week. The very high hospitalization rate may be related to the homelessness of the cohort but could represent a more virulent strain. HAV infection occurred in some individuals chronically infected with either hepatitis B or C, but it is not clear whether the deaths occurred in those individuals. Homelessness and illicit substance use seem to be relevant risk factors, while MSM men who have sex with men practices are not. It remains unclear how and from what vehicle the virus is spreading. The San Diego County government is now recommending hepatitis A vaccination for food handlers. The vaccine recommendation has also been expanded to those who work in health care in addition to prior recommendations for those who work in public safety, sanitation, homeless shelters and behavioral and homeless service providers.<br><br><strong> In 2014, a report regarding the possibility of routine HAV immunization for USA food handlers appeared in the lay press  ): \"Health Officials Urge Hepatitis A Vaccine for Food Workers </strong><br> Federal regulators and health officials are now urging lawmakers to make it mandatory for all food handlers in the USA to be vaccinated against the hepatitis A virus (HAV), NBC News reports. In April 2014, nearly 2000 people received immunoglobulin shots to prevent hepatitis A infections after restaurant workers in New York and South Carolina tested positive for the virus. In February 2014, a scare at a seafood restaurant in South Carolina prompted nearly 100 people to get immunized against the disease. Last September 2013, nearly 2000 people in the Bronx, New York had to receive preventative jabs after an infected food handler caused an HAV outbreak. For years, the CDC has said that food handlers didn't need hepatitis A shots because outbreaks of the disease have been relatively rare since an effective vaccine came out in 1996. However, health experts are beginning to see a gap among people in their 20s, 30s, 40s and 50s  the demographic most likely to eat and work in restaurants  who seemingly missed out on the preventative shot. New hepatitis A infections also seem to be on the rise in the USA over the past few years. The restaurant industry argues that giving out mandatory vaccines to all its workers would be difficult. The vaccine has to be given in 2 doses, months apart, for a person to get full immunity. Also, the cost of universal hepatitis A vaccinations to the companies could amount to USD 150-200 per worker.\" No action appears to have been made on this issue as based on the latest recommendations: Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices Recommended Immunization Schedule for Adults Aged 19 Years or Older  United States, 2017. MMWR 2017; 66(5):136-138  ). The latest formal statement that I could find on this issue is from CDC: Prevention of Hepatitis A Through Active or Passive Immunization: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).<br><br><strong> MMWR 2006;55(RR07):1-23 the citations can be accessed at the original URL: \"Food-Service Establishments and Food Handlers </strong><br> Foodborne hepatitis A outbreaks are recognized relatively infrequently in the USA. Outbreaks typically are associated with contamination of food during preparation by an HAV-infected food handler; a single infected food handler can transmit HAV to dozens or even hundreds of persons (34,36,37,7881). However, the majority of food handlers with hepatitis A do not transmit HAV. Food handlers are not at increased risk for hepatitis A because of their occupation. However, among the approximately 40 000 adults with hepatitis A reported during 19922000 for whom an occupation was known, 8% were identified as food handlers, reflecting the large number of persons employed in the food service industry (34). Evaluating HAV-infected food handlers is a common and labor-intensive task for public health departments. In a 1992 common-source outbreak involving 43 persons, the estimated total medical and disease control cost was approximately USD 800 000 (82). Outbreaks associated with food, especially green onions and other raw produce, that has been contaminated before reaching a food-service establishment have been recognized increasingly in recent years (29,30,8388). Low attack rates are common, and outbreaks often have been recognized in association with a single restaurant in which no infected food handler was identified on subsequent investigation (29,83,88).\" \"Persons who work as food handlers can contract hepatitis A and potentially transmit HAV to others. One national economic analysis concluded that routine vaccination of all food handlers would not be economical from a societal or restaurant owner's perspective (197). Nonetheless, to decrease the frequency of evaluations of food handlers with hepatitis A and the need for postexposure prophylaxis of patrons, consideration may be given to vaccination of employees who work in areas where state and local health authorities or private employers determine that such vaccination is appropriate. Food handlers who receive hepatitis A vaccine should be provided with a record of the immunization. Those who do not should be informed of the signs and symptoms of hepatitis A and taught food preparation practices that reduce the risk for fecal contamination.\" Given the increasing number of cases of hepatitis A in the USA, including ongoing large outbreaks in California and Michigan and the 2016 Hawaii outbreak from contaminated scallops that affected some food handlers, it may be time to readdress this issue. - Mod.LL   .

Risk Factors Associated with Blood Exposure for Sporadic Hepatitis E in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2017 Aug 14. doi: 10.4269/ajtmh.17-0261.<br><br><strong> Abstract </strong><br> Fecal contamination of drinking water is associated with large hepatitis E virus (HEV) outbreaks of genotypes 1 and 2 in endemic areas. Sporadic transmission of HEV genotypes 3 and 4 in high-income countries has been associated with exposure to blood and animal contact. The objective of the study was to identify the risk factors for hepatitis E and the genotype(s) causing sporadic hepatitis E in Dhaka, Bangladesh. We selected, from a diagnostic center in Dhaka between November 2008 and November 2009, cases presenting with jaundice and anti-HEV IgM antibodies and age-matched controls were defined as those with no history of jaundice and normal blood test results. Serum samples were tested for HEV RNA using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction followed by a sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. A total of 109 cases and 109 controls were enrolled. The cases were more likely to be male (adjusted matched odds ratios mOR 2.2, 95 percent CI: 1.2-3.9; P = 0.01), or have reported contact with another person's blood or blood product, or contact with blood-contaminated sharp instruments (adjusted mOR 2.1, 95 percent CI: 1.1-4.1; P = 0.03) than controls. There were no significant differences between the cases and the controls in terms of reported high-risk sexual intercourse, consumption of undercooked meat, or contact or drinking fecally-contaminated water. The sera from 3 cases carried HEV RNA, all belonging to genotype 1. Findings from this study suggest that contact with human blood and sharing sharp instruments may transmit sporadic hepatitis E in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Efforts to prevent the transmission of blood-borne pathogens may also prevent sporadic HEV transmission in this endemic setting.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-SoAs There has been increased interest, especially in Europe, of assessing the risk of HEV transmission via blood transfusion in order to assess the need for routine screening. Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis E is generally self-limited without a chronic phase but it is clear, especially with genotype 3 that chronic infection may occur. This is particularly true in individuals with cellular immunodeficiencies such as those who are solid organ transplant recipients and those infected with HIV. - Mod.LL   .

Cases have risen to 16 since June 2017. And with the new school term just a few weeks away, Public Health Wales is urging parents to make sure their children have had 2 doses of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine before classes begin again. Consultant in communicable disease control for Public Health Wales Dr Rhianwen Stiff said: \"In our current outbreak, we have seen measles pass between pupils at the same school. With children returning from holidays in Europe, and with our ongoing outbreak in Newport and Torfaen, we are concerned that the start of the new term could lead to further cases of measles in Wales. Measles is highly contagious and passes very easily between people who are unvaccinated. The message is simple, MMR offers the best and only protection against measles. If you, or your child, are not up to date with 2 doses of the MMR vaccine, speak to your GP surgery immediately.\" Parents are also being urged not to take children who appear to have measles to hospital or a GP surgery without calling ahead 1st. A vaccination programme in schools across Newport was launched following the 1st outbreak, with 1089 children receiving immunisation. Adults born after 1970 who have never had measles or the MMR vaccine are also being urged to contact their GP to arrange immunisation, especially if they work with children. The 1st dose of the vaccine is usually given to babies between 12 and 13 months, and the 2nd at around 3 years, 4 months. But it can be given at any time. The cases are being directly linked to a larger outbreak in Europe, which has affected 14 000 people, 35 of whom have died, since the start of the year 2017.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. - Mod.LK ", "dates": ["Date: Tue 8 Aug 2017", "According to a statement released Tue [8 Aug 2017] the Ministry of", "Date: Wed 9 Aug 2017", "140 cases of measles have been reported across 10 local governments in", "Vakkai told newsmen on Wed [9 Aug 2017] in Jalingo that the majority", "Date: Fri 11 Aug 2017", " Cases have risen to 16 since June 2017", "following the 1st outbreak with 1089 children receiving", "13 months and the 2nd at around 3 years 4 months", "which has affected 14 000 people 35 of whom have died since the"], "title": "Measles update (40): Africa, Europe "}, "479": {"sentences": "   Fri 11 Aug 2017 12:55 PM EAT Source: New Vision edited Results from the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) have possibly demystified the strange disease that early this week led to the death of a 20-year-old female in Luweero. According to a statement from the ministry of health, the female who suffered high fever, dizziness, and blood secretions from her ears and mouth died from high levels of carboxyhemoglobin, as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning. There are currently 3 female cases admitted at Bishop Asili hospital, Luweero. However, results from UVRI indicate that all cases were negative for Ebola, Marburg, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Rift Valley fever, and Sosuga viruses. \"The ministry of health team is working closely with the District Health Team to monitor, review, and manage these cases as well as orienting health workers on management and referral protocols of suspected cases,\" reads the statement. Byline: Vicky Wandawa  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. While it is good news this victim does not seem to have any of the hemorrhagic diseases mentioned, the reported clinical signs do not completely fit with carbon monoxide poisoning either. Signs and symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning may include any or all of the following: - a dull persistent headache - confusion - dizziness - weakness - blurred vision - shortness of breath - loss of consciousness. I have never known carbon monoxide to cause bleeding from the ears. Other than hemorrhagic diseases, bleeding from the ears may be associated trauma to the ear drum, pressure changes (such as with diving) causing rupture of the ear drum, an infection in the middle ear, or a foreign body in the ear. Trauma to the eardrum may result in from a tear or puncture and present as: - acute hearing loss - persistent ringing in the ear or ears - vertigo (a feeling or sensation of spinning) - vertigo induced nausea and/or vomiting - rare occasions may include a small amount of fluid, but seldom blood. An infection, especially of the middle ear may present as: - fever associated with pain in the ear or pressure in the ear - unsteady balance - inability or difficulty sleeping. Abrupt changes in pressure to the ear or within the ear may present as: - acute pain in the ear or intense pressure feeling in the ear - a ringing sensation in the ears - dizziness - in rare cases blood or fluid from one or both ears. Foreign bodies in the ear are most apt to cause bleeding from the ears. Other clinical signs and symptoms associated with this may include: - fluid or blood discharge from the affected ear, or if both ears if they are both damaged - pressure in the ear(s) - pain - hearing loss - dizziness - nausea and/or vomiting. None of these ear conditions would be associated with blood from the mouth. So while the individual may have had carbon monoxide poisoning, it seems there is still more to the story.

In May 2017, health officials reported 2 imported cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in Senegal imported from Mauritania. A 3rd imported case was reported in June 2017. He developed headache, muscle and joints pains and diarrhea on 20 Aug 2017 and sought medical attention. He was treated with anti-malarial medicines and analgesics. After 2 days, he returned for medical care as his condition worsened. He was tested for CCHF because of bleeding manifestations and was IgM positive for Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The patient is still hospitalized and in stable clinical condition. Mauritania experienced a fairly large CCHF outbreak in 2003, involving 38 cases with a case fatality rate of 28.6 percent. According to the WHO, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is a widespread disease caused by a tick-borne virus (Nairovirus) of the Bunyaviridae family. The CCHF virus causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 percent. CCHF is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and Asian countries south of the 50th parallel north, the geographical limit of the principal tick vector. The hosts of the CCHF virus include a wide range of wild and domestic animals such as cattle, sheep and goats. Animals become infected by the bite of infected ticks, and the virus remains in their bloodstream for about one week after infection, allowing the tick-animal-tick cycle to continue when another tick bites. Although a number of tick genera are capable of becoming infected with CCHF virus, ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_ are the principal vectors. The CCHF virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians. Human-to-human transmission is possible. Byline: Robert Herriman  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. An outbreak of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever was documented in Nouakchott, the capital of Mauritania in 2003. The index case was detected on 18 Feb 2003. By 21 Mar 2003, the Ministry of Health of Mauritania had reported a total of 35 cases (18 laboratory confirmed) of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), including 6 deaths Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever - Mauritania (04) http://promedmail.org/post/20030324.0732. In the period from February to August 2003, 38 persons were infected with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus; 35 of these persons were residents of Nouakchott. The 1st patient was a young woman who became ill shortly after butchering a goat. She transmitted the infection to 15 persons in the hospital where she was admitted and 4 members of her family. In Nouakchott, 2 disease clusters and 11 isolated cases were identified. Of the patients not infected by the 1st case-patient, almost half were butchers, which suggests that the primary mode of animal-to-human transmission was direct contact with blood of infected animals. Cattle heavily infested with ticks were more likely to be CCHFV seropositive, and vector control to reduce the tick burden can result in reduced seroprevalence. Cattle are noted as the most sensitive indicator of low-level CCHFV circulation because they tend to be highly infested with _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks, which are the most common vectors of CCHF  . The circulation of CCHF virus and the high prevalence of infected animals and ticks have been well documented in Mauritanian farming areas since 1983 Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever and Rift Valley fever in south-eastern Mauritania.

See country-specific section below, for more details. Afghanistan  - One new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week, bringing the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 to 5. It is the most recent case in the country, with onset of paralysis on 19 Jun 2017 from Kandahar.  - One new WPV1-positive environmental sample was reported in the past week week of 9-15 Jul 2017, from Nangarhar, collected on Wed 21 Jun 2017. It is the 7th WPV1-positive environmental sample detected in the country this year 2017; 3 of the 7 samples are from Nangarhar and 3 from Kandahar.  - With most of Afghanistan polio-free, efforts are focused on continuing to strengthen operations, in close coordination with Pakistan, to address remaining low-level transmission in the common reservoir area of the Quetta-Kandahar transmission corridor.  - Afghanistan is carrying out a programme review focusing on the implementation of the National Emergency Action Plan and making necessary adjustments for the 2nd half of 2017.  - Read the latest polio update from WHO Afghanistan to see information on cases, surveillance, vaccination campaigns for the month of June 2017. Available at:   Pakistan  - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week week of 9-15 Jul 2017 ; the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 3. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on Sun 11 Jun 2017, from Killa Abdullah, Balochistan.  - The year 2016 saw the lowest ever annual number of polio cases in the country but poliovirus continues to be isolated through environmental surveillance over a significant geographical range. Efforts are ongoing through implementation of the national emergency action plan to address remaining gaps in coverage and surveillance, in close coordination with neighbouring Afghanistan. Nigeria  - No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week week of 9-15 Jul 2017. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 21 August 2016 in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno.  - Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016).  - The response is part of a broader regional outbreak response, coordinated with neighbouring countries, in particular the Lake Chad sub-region, including northern Cameroon, parts of Central African Republic, Chad and southern Niger.  - Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance. Lake Chad Basin  - The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in Nigeria poses a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak.  - Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region. Central Africa  - No new cases were reported in the past week week of 9-15 Jul 2017. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo) is affected by 2 separate outbreaks of circulating vaccine derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2), in Haut Lomami province (2 cases, with onset of paralysis on Wed 8 Mar 2017 and Mon 20 Feb 2017); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on Sun 26 Mar 2017 and Tue 18 Apr 2017, with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on Tue 2 May 2017).  - Outbreak response plans are currently being finalised, with supplementary immunization activities using monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols.  - The 1st mOPV2 campaign was implemented end of June (27-29 June 2017) targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 years in the 2 affected provinces.  - Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.  - DR Congo is also affected by an Ebola outbreak, in Bas Uele province in the north of the country. Coordination among both outbreak response teams will be necessary and teams are already working on this declared over by WHO on Sun 2 Jul 2017. - Mod.MPP Middle East  - In Syria, 4 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week week of 9-15 Jul 2017, all from Mayadeen district, Deir-Al-Zour governorate. The total number of cVDPV2 cases is now 27. All cases had onset of paralysis between Fri 3 Mar 2017 and Tue 6 Jun 2017. 26 of the cases are from Mayadeen, and one case is from Raqua governorate.  - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Although access to Deir-Al-Zour is compromised due to insecurity, the Governorate has been partially reached by several vaccination campaigns against polio and other vaccine-preventable diseases since the beginning of 2016. Most recently, 2 campaigns have been conducted in March and April 2017 using the bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV). However, only limited coverage was possible through these campaigns.  - A total of 2 outbreak response campaigns are planned covering both Deir-Al-Zour and Raqua, the 1st to commence on Sat 22 Jul 2017 targeting 328 000 children aged less than 5 years in Deir-Al-Zour and 120 000 children in Raqua.

Of note is that in the global update report from the GPEI mentioning a positive environmental sample from Kandahar, Afghanistan less than a week later there was confirmation of a polio case due to infection with WPV1. One can't help but wonder if a similar occurrence will occur now in Nangarhar, having just identified a positive environmental sample. With respect to the outbreak of cVDPV2 in Syria, according to the Tue 18 Jul 2017 WHO-UNICEF situation update (available at there have been a total of 87 AFP cases reported from Deir-Al-Zour and one from Raqqah. Of note is that there were 28 AFP cases reported from Deir-al-Zour in May 2017 with 16 confirmed as due to cVDPV2, in June 2017 there were 20 AFP cases reported with 3 confirmed thus far as due to infection with cVDPV2, and there have been 5 AFP cases reported in July 2017 thus far. Of note are the newly released Haj vaccination requirements: \"Regardless of age and vaccination status, proof of receipt of a dose of oral polio vaccine, or inactivated polio vaccine, within the previous 12 months and at least 4 weeks prior to departure, is required to apply for an entry visa to Saudi Arabia for travelers arriving from countries including Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan. \"The polio vaccine is also required of pilgrims from states no longer affected by the infectious disease, but which remain vulnerable to reinfection.

En Afrique, le VIH est le principal d\u00e9terminant de la hausse de l\u2019incidence de la tuberculose observ\u00e9e ces dix derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es.  La tuberculose chez l'enfant L'ampleur de la tuberculose chez l'enfant est inconnue mais on estime qu'elle repr\u00e9sente environ 6% de tous les cas incidents. L\u2019objectif d\u2019un monde o\u00f9 aucun enfant ne meurt de tuberculose, auquel souscrit la communaut\u00e9 internationale de lutte antituberculeuse, rassemble plusieurs partenaires cl\u00e9s autour de cette ambition commune.  Tuberculose et sexosp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 La tuberculose est l\u2019une des principales causes infectieuses de d\u00e9c\u00e8s chez la femme. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que la tuberculose touche principalement les femmes lorsqu\u2019elles sont \u00e9conomiquement productives et en \u00e2ge de procr\u00e9er, leurs enfants et leur famille en ressentent aussi fortement les cons\u00e9quences  Tuberculose en prison Les taux de tuberculose en prison seraient jusqu\u2019\u00e0 100 fois sup\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 ceux que l\u2019on observe dans la population civile. Pourtant, la tuberculose n\u2019est pas une cons\u00e9quence in\u00e9vitable de l\u2019incarc\u00e9ration et peut \u00eatre ma\u00eetris\u00e9e.

The chances of getting Zika from mosquitoes living above that altitude are very low.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to Honduras or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers considering pregnancy:  Before you or your partner travel, talk to your health care provider about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection.  Wait before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.  If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex &ndash; or do not have sex &ndash; for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex, or do not have sex, for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy  Talk to your health care provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you&rsquo;re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Wait at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  Men are advised to wait longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.gov  Contact CDC  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  1600 Clifton Road  Atlanta ,  GA  30329-4027  USA  800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)  Contact CDC-INFO  TOP", "dates": [" Page created: December 18 2015", " Page last updated: August 08 2017", " Page last reviewed: August 08 2017", " 30329-4027", " 800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)"], "title": ["Zika Virus in Honduras"]}, "639": {"sentences": "WHO | 140th session of the Executive Board  Skip to main content  Access  Home Alt+0  Navigation Alt+1  Content Alt+2  Search  Search the  WHO .int site  Submit  Advanced search  Navigation  Home  Health topics  Data  Media centre  Publications  Countries  Programmes  Governance  About WHO  Language  \u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a  \u4e2d\u6587  English  Fran\u00e7ais  \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439  Espa\u00f1ol  Media centre  Menu  Media centre  News  News releases  Previous years  Statements  Previous years  Notes for the media  Previous years  Commentaries  2016  2015  2014  Events  Official WHO health days  Meetings and consultations  Fact sheets  Fact files  Questions & answers  Features  Multimedia  Contacts  140th session of the Executive Board   23 January \u2013 1 February 2017 Location: Geneva, Switzerland  The 140th WHO Executive Board will take place in Geneva between 23 January and 1 February 2017.

According to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) FluView published today 28 Jul 2017, 11 human infections with novel influenza A viruses were detected in Ohio during the week of 16 Jul 2017. All 11 persons were infected with influenza A (H3N2) variant (H3N2v) viruses and reported exposure to swine in a fair setting during the week preceding illness onset. Ten of the 11 patients were children less than 18 years of age, and one patient was an adult aged 50-64 years. None were hospitalized, and all have fully recovered from their illness. No human-to-human transmission has been identified. Swine influenza A (H3N2) viruses were identified from respiratory samples collected from pigs at the same fair. Public health and agriculture officials are investigating the extent of disease among humans and swine, but no increases in influenza-like illness in the community have been reported. These 11 infections bring the total number of H3N2v infections during 2017 to 12 and the cumulative total since 2011 to 376. Swine influenza is a respiratory disease of pigs caused by type A influenza viruses that cause outbreaks in pigs. Signs of swine flu in pigs can include fever, coughing (barking), sneezing, breathing difficulties, eye redness or inflammation, and not eating. Some pigs infected with influenza, however, may show no signs of illness at all. Swine flu viruses do not normally infect people; however, sporadic human infections with these viruses have occurred. Human infections with H1N1v, H3N2v and H1N2v viruses have been detected in the United States. Spread between pigs and people is thought to happen mainly when an infected pig (or human) coughs or sneezes, and droplets with influenza virus in them spread through the air. If these droplets land in the nose or mouth, or are inhaled, that person (or pig) could be infected. There also is some evidence that the virus might spread through touching something that has virus on it and then touching the mouth or nose. A 3rd way to possibly get infected is to inhale particles containing influenza virus. Influenza has not been shown to be transmissible to people through eating properly handled and prepared pork (pig meat) or other products derived from pigs. Most commonly, human infections with variant viruses occur in people with exposure to infected pigs (e.g., at a fair or at work). Illness associated with variant virus infection includes symptoms similar to those of seasonal flu. Most illness has been mild, but as with seasonal flu, hospitalization and death can occur. There have been documented cases of multiple people becoming sick after exposure to one or more infected pigs and also cases of limited spread of variant influenza viruses from person to person. Byline: Robert Herriman  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. As a background to this report, a case of H3N2 swine flu was lab confirmed in one hog at the Clinton County Fair in early July 2017, but there were no human cases at that time. Later, 2 hogs at the Franklin County Fair (Columbus, Ohio) tested positive for swine H1N1, and that exhibit was also closed  . Influenza A viruses circulating in swine that have infected humans are referred to as \"variant\" viruses and are denoted with a letter \"v.\" Human infections with H1N1v, H3N2v and H1N2v viruses have been detected in the United States. Most commonly, human infections with variant viruses occur in people with exposure to infected swine (e.g. children near swine at a fair or workers in the swine industry). There have been documented cases of multiple people becoming sick after exposure to one or more infected swine and also rare cases of limited spread of variant influenza viruses from person-to-person. The vast majority of human infections with variant influenza viruses do not result in person-to-person spread. However, each human infection with a swine influenza virus should be fully investigated to be sure that such viruses are not spreading in an efficient and ongoing way in humans and, if infected animals are identified, to limit further exposure of humans to these animals. During the summer of 2012, the largest outbreak of influenza A/H3N2 was reported, with 10 states reporting over 300 confirmed cases, nearly all linked to county or state fair attendance  . The state of Indiana reported the most cases (n=138), followed by Ohio (n=106)  . While the H3N2v virus was the most commonly reported strain, H1N1v and H1N2v were also detected. While most of these infections were mild, 16 people were hospitalized and one died  . In August 2016, there were reports of 18 fair attendees who were diagnosed with a swine variant (H3N2v) influenza virus in 2 states; Michigan and Ohio, over a period of several weeks  . It was reported that 16 of the 18 cases analyzed belonged to a new genotype not previously detected in humans.<br><br><strong> Clinical Presentation and Risk Groups -</strong><br> Clinical characteristics of human infections with variant viruses generally have been similar to signs and symptoms of uncomplicated seasonal influenza, including fever, cough, pharyngitis, rhinorrhea, myalgia, and headache. Vomiting and diarrhea also have been reported in some infections in children. Milder clinical illness is possible, including lack of fever. The duration of illness appears to be similar to uncomplicated seasonal influenza, approximately 3 to 5 days. While assumed to be similar to seasonal influenza virus infection, the duration of viral replication and possible infectiousness of variant virus infection has not been studied.<br><br><strong> Clinical Diagnosis -</strong><br> Variant virus infection cannot be distinguished by clinical features from seasonal influenza virus infection, or from infection with other respiratory viruses that can cause influenza-like illness (fever and either cough or sore throat). Therefore, the key to suspecting variant virus infection in an ill patient is to elicit an epidemiological link to recent swine exposure in the week prior to illness onset. Exposure can be defined as follows: - Direct contact with swine (e.g., showing swine, raising swine, feeding swine, or cleaning swine waste) - Indirect exposure to swine (e.g., visiting a swine farm or walking through a swine barn), especially if swine were known to be ill; or - Close contact (within 2 meters or approximately 6 feet) with an ill person who had recent swine exposure or is known to be infected with a variant virus. For any ill person with an exposure as defined above, respiratory samples should be taken for testing. Clinicians should obtain a nasopharyngeal swab or aspirate (or a combined nasal swab and throat swab), place the swab or aspirate (or combined specimen) into viral transport medium, and contact their state or local health department to arrange transport and request a timely diagnosis at a state public health laboratory. Only CDC and state public health laboratories can confirm variant virus infections. As per the CDC weekly Flu View report (week ending 30 Jul 2017: \" Eleven human infections with novel influenza A viruses were detected in Ohio during week 29. All 11 persons were infected with influenza A (H3N2) variant (H3N2v) viruses and reported exposure to swine in a fair setting during the week preceding illness onset. Ten of the 11 patients were children less than 18 years of age and one patient was an adult aged 50-64 years. None were hospitalized and all have fully recovered from their illness. No human-to-human transmission has been identified. Swine influenza A (H3N2) viruses were identified from respiratory samples collected from pigs at the same fair.

These 11 infections bring the total number of H3N2v infections during 2017 to 12 and the cumulative total since 2011 to 376.\" It's is important to ensure early identification and investigation of human infections with novel influenza A viruses to ensure timely risk assessment and so that appropriate public health measures can be taken. - Mod.UBA   .

The ProMED-mail post rightly mentions the collaboration with international experts to build surveillance in Gibraltar. However we would like to set the record straight as experts were mandated by ECDC (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) and EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) through VectorNet activities (European network for sharing data on the geographic distribution of arthropod vectors, transmitting human and animal disease agents). Indeed a major action of VectorNet is to promote and support surveillance of invasive and native mosquito vector species in Europe. Therefore emphasis is put on capacity building in countries and regions where gaps in vector surveillance exist. Recent significant success outcomes are numerous. For example, in the Caucasus, VectorNet field missions demonstrated the establishment and spreading of populations of the major vector species _Ae. aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ in both Georgia and north eastern Turkey in 2015 (Akiner et al, 2016). The latter species was also found for the 1st time in Armenia in 2016 (VectorNet field activity report, 2017). Later this year 2017, a mission will launch the survey in Azerbaijan. In the Balkans, _Ae. albopictus_ was found widespread in Bosnia in 2015, and locally established in FYROM Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (2016) and in north Montenegro (2016). In Western Europe, the invasive species _Ae. japonicus_ was found by VectorNet experts spreading fast in France, from Alsace to the counties (d\u00e9partements) Vosges (2016), Haute-Sa\u00f4ne, and Doubs (2017), and _Ae. albopictus_ could recently be detected in Gibraltar by local partners trained in 2016 and prolonging the vector surveillance. These VectorNet actions ( ), together with the capacity building programme implemented by WHO Europe in non-EU countries of the European continent ( ) and with the national surveillance programmes implemented now in many EU countries are improving the preparedness of the continent to face vector-borne diseases.<br><br><strong> References </strong><br> 1.

The efforts of the VectorNet partners in surveillance and capacity building are impressive. Their activities in EU and bordering countries is a good example of recognition that vector arthropods know nothing of international borders, making surveillance across broad geographic areas essential for preparedness, prevention and control. The success of VectorNet has gone beyond detection of _Ae. aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_. Their surveillance has also been tracking the spread of another invasive vector, _Ae. japonicus_. The VectorNet approach is a good model to adopt by other geographic areas at risk of arthropod-borne pathogens. - Mod.TY ", "dates": ["Date: Tue 29 Aug 2017", "org/post/20170829", "5280719]", "Armenia in 2016 (VectorNet field activity report 2017)", "(2016) and in north Montenegro (2016)", " 2016 ; 10(4): e0004664;", "VectorNet Technical report 28 Mar 2017", "L\u00f6rracherstrasse 50 4125 Riehen"], "title": "Invasive mosquito - Gibraltar (02): comment "}, "364": {"sentences": "   1 Aug 2017 16:24:30 BST Source: Outbreak News Today edited In a follow-up to the hepatitis A outbreak in Portugal, 402 cases have been confirmed since the beginning of 2017, according to local media. The majority of cases occurred in the Lisbon and Tagus Valley regions. This is up from 322 cases one month ago. According to the latest DGS data, this outbreak, which began at the beginning of 2017 and affects other European countries, affected mainly men (88 per cent), who in more than half the cases (52 per cent) contracted the infection via sexual contact. In view of the outbreak of hepatitis A, the DGS reinforced vaccination prior to the major summer festivals and advised that preventive measures should be taken during these events and after surveillance for hepatitis A-compatible symptoms. Most people who are infected recover completely. Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis A does not develop into chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), and death from hepatitis A infection is rare. Because of specific sexual practices, men who have sex with men (MSM) are known to have a higher risk of acquiring hepatitis A and, if not vaccinated in childhood, should be immunized if found to be anti-HAV negative. The recommendations for HAV vaccination in susceptible adults from the United States' Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ACIP are to vaccinate any person seeking protection from hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection and people with any of the following indications: - men who have sex with men; - people who use injection or non-injection illicit drugs; - people working with HAV-infected primates or with HAV in a research laboratory setting; - people with chronic liver disease and people who receive clotting factor concentrates; - people traveling to or working in countries that have high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A; and - unvaccinated people who anticipate close personal contact (such as household or regular babysitting) with an international adoptee during the 1st 60 days after arrival in the United States from a country with high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A. The 1st dose of the 2-dose hepatitis A vaccine series should be administered as soon as adoption is planned, ideally 2 or more weeks before the arrival of the adoptee. The HAV vaccination history of the cases is not stated. - Mod.LL   .

Zika virus (or Zika) has been reported in Saint Martin. Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in Saint Martin are infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:  Women who are pregnant:  Do not travel to Saint Martin.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to Saint Martin or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers considering pregnancy:  Before you or your partner travel, talk to your health care provider about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection.  Wait before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.  If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex &ndash; or do not have sex &ndash; for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex, or do not have sex, for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy  Talk to your health care provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you&rsquo;re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Wait at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  Men are advised to wait longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.gov  Contact CDC  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  1600 Clifton Road  Atlanta ,  GA  30329-4027  USA  800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)  Contact CDC-INFO  TOP", "dates": [" Page created: January 22 2016", " Page last updated: August 08 2017", " Page last reviewed: August 08 2017", " 30329-4027", " 800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)"], "title": ["Zika Virus in Saint Martin"]}, "596": {"sentences": "OMS | El multiling\u00fcismo y la OMS  Ir al contenido principal  Access  Home Alt+0  Navigation Alt+1  Content Alt+2  Buscar  Buscar en WHO.int  Submit  B\u00fasqueda avanzada  Navigation  Acceso  Temas de salud  Datos y estad\u00edsticas  Centro de prensa  Publicaciones  Pa\u00edses  Programas y proyectos  Gobernanza  Acerca de la OMS  Language  \u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a  \u4e2d\u6587  English  Fran\u00e7ais  \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439  Espa\u00f1ol  Acerca de la OMS  Men\u00fa de navegaci\u00f3n  Acerca de la OMS  Nuestras actividades  D\u00f3nde trabajamos  Gobernanza  Alianzas y colaboraciones  Alianzas  Alianzas acogidas  Otros programas, servicios y secretar\u00edas acogidos por la OMS  Documentaci\u00f3n de la OMS sobre alianzas  Planificaci\u00f3n, finanzas y rendici\u00f3n de cuentas  Reformas de la OMS  Programas y establecimiento de prioridades  Reforma de la gobernanza  Reforma de la gesti\u00f3n  Proceso de reforma de la OMS: documentaci\u00f3n  Capacidad ante emergencias  Grupo asesor  Comit\u00e9 de Asesoramiento y Supervisi\u00f3n  El multiling\u00fcismo y la OMS  El multiling\u00fcismo del sitio web, las publicaciones y otros recursos de la OMS permite que la informaci\u00f3n sanitaria llegue a las personas que la necesitan, en lenguas que pueden entender.

Pathogenesis of Ebola virus disease remains poorly understood. We used concomitant determination of routine laboratory biomarkers and Ebola viremia to explore the potential role of viral replication in specific organ damage. Conclusion. This study provides evidence to support that Ebola virus may have a direct role in muscular damage and imbalance of the coagulation system. We did not found strong evidence suggestive of a direct role of Ebola virus in kidney damage. The role of the virus in liver damage remains unclear, but our evidence suggests that acute severe liver injury is not a typical feature of Ebola virus disease. See source URL for full report.

In a collaborative report doctors found that the local health centres are too ill-equipped to effectively treat all infected people. The population in El Dindir, amounting to more than 193 000 people in 88 villages in the southeastern state, are under threat from contracting the infectious disease, according to a new report by the Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors. There have been 45 people who died from cholera and 280 cases of infection in the hospitals and health centres in the locality. \"These numbers will rise in the poor conditions of the health centres,\" the report, published on Mon 17 Jul 2017, reads. \"The buildings are ill-equipped and lacking cadres and aides.\" An increase in the number of cases in the past days coincided with a poor drinking water supply, the doctors said, in particular with regard to the rainy season in the summer months. The area is known for high rainfall during these months. The most recent deadly cholera victims were reported in El Tamrab village on Mon 17 Jul 2017, from a total of 31 people who died from cholera. An activist in El Dindir reported to Radio Dabanga that the hospitalized cases at one of the medical isolation centres have amounted to 13 people. He called for the provision of awareness about hygienic environments, in light of the government's inaction. The Sudanese authorities and humanitarian relief organizations in the country refuse to make any reference to the disease being cholera.<br><br><strong> Darfur camps </strong><br> In Darfur's Zamzam camp for displaced people 3 new cases of cholera were recorded. Reports from El Salam camp south of Nyala in South Darfur also reported cases of cholera and deaths: 6 people died last week week of 10 Jul 2017. There were 17 cases of infection in total, volunteers said. The volunteer warned of increased rates of infection in El Salam camp and the surrounding villages when the rainy season peaks in South Darfur. Starting mid-June 2017, torrential rains swept through camps, leaving the streets flooded and numbers of families homeless. Cholera is a fast-developing, highly contagious infection that can spread in areas short of clean drinking water and with poor sanitation. In September 2016 Radio Dabanga received the 1st reports about cholera cases, in Blue Nile state. Since then, the disease spread in eastern Sudan, and later to the Northern State and central Sudan's El Gezira. In April 2017, sources in White Nile state reported a rapid spread of cholera. The disease then spread to North Kordofan, and fully hit Khartoum in May 2017, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Sudan said in June 2017.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness. As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea: \"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as \"potentially the most important medical advance\" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5). \"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.<br><br><strong>\" References </strong><br> 1.

This is the 1st confirmed case of EEE in North Carolina this year 2017. A viral disease, EEE affects the central nervous system and is transmitted to horses by infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs of EEE include moderate to high fever, depression, lack of appetite, cranial nerve deficits (facial paralysis, tongue weakness, difficulty swallowing), behavioral changes (aggression, self-mutilation, or drowsiness), gait abnormalities, or severe central nervous system signs, such as head-pressing, circling, blindness, and seizures. The course of EEE can be swift, with death occurring 2 to 3 days after onset of clinical signs despite intensive care. Horses that survive might have long-lasting impairments and neurologic problems. \"If your horses exhibit any symptoms of EEE, contact your veterinarian immediately,\" said state veterinarian Doug Meckes. \"And if your horses aren't vaccinated, talk to your veterinarian about vaccinating them as soon as possible against EEE and West Nile virus,\" another mosquitoborne disease. The vaccinations initially require 2 shots, 30 days apart, for horses, mules, and donkeys having no prior vaccination history. Meckes recommends a booster shot every 6 months in North Carolina because of the state's prolonged mosquito season. In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and using mosquito repellents and fly gear. Further, mosquitoes can breed in any puddle that lasts for more than 4 days, so removing any source of standing water can reduce the chance of exposing animals to WNV or EEE. People, horses, and birds can become infected from a bite by a mosquito carrying the diseases, but there is no evidence that horses can transmit the virus to other horses, birds, or people through direct contact. Birds are very susceptible to the EEE virus. Those areas using sentinel birds usually have a bit of warning that the virus is circulating in the area. It allows them a little bit of time to alert the public to the dangers of the mosquitoes, to remind the public to vaccine their horses and to use horse-appropriate mosquito repellent, and to remind them to protect themselves from other viruses mosquitoes carry.

Illnesses started on dates ranging from 1 Mar 2017 to 3 Aug 2017. Of 33 people with available information, 16 have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. 12 (32 percent) ill people are children 5 years of age or younger.

In interviews, ill people answered questions about contact with animals during the week before becoming ill. 15 (45 percent) of the 33 people interviewed reported contact with turtles or their environments, such as water from a turtle habitat, before getting sick. In interviews with 9 ill people about where their turtles came from, 6 reported buying a turtle from a flea market or street vendor, or receiving the turtle as a gift. In 2015, state and local health officials collected samples from turtles at a street vendor. Whole genome sequencing showed that the _Salmonella_ Agbeni isolated from ill people in this outbreak is closely related genetically to the _S._ Agbeni isolates from turtles. This close genetic relationship means that people in this outbreak are more likely to share a common source of infection. Do not buy small turtles as pets or give them as gifts. Since 1975, the FDA has banned selling and distributing turtles with shells less than 4 inches long as pets because they are often linked to _Salmonella_ infections, especially in young children. All turtles, regardless of size, can carry _Salmonella_ bacteria even if they look healthy and clean. These outbreaks are a reminder to follow simple steps to enjoy pet reptiles and keep your family healthy. This outbreak is expected to continue since consumers might be unaware of the risk of _Salmonella_ infection from small turtles. If properly cared for, turtles have a long life expectancy.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. In 2008, CDC reported on an ongoing outbreak of _S._ Paratyphi B var. Java (CDC: _Salmonella_ Infections Associated with Exposure to Turtles  USA, 2007-2008. Morbid Mortal Weekly Rep 2008; 57(03): 69-72;  . Some of the discussion of the report is reproduced below: \"The prohibition on the sale and distribution of small turtles was enacted in 1975, after public health investigations demonstrated that small turtles were a major source of human _Salmonella_ infections, particularly in children. In 1972, a study in New Jersey indicated that small pet turtles accounted for approximately 23 percent of _Salmonella_ infections in children (4). In 1980, the 1975 prohibition was estimated to have prevented 100 000 _Salmonella_ infections in American children each year since going into effect (5). However, this prohibition has an exception: small turtles may be sold legally for scientific, educational, or exhibition purposes. During 2001-2006, the number of turtles kept as pets in the USA increased 86 percent to nearly 2 million turtles (6), suggesting that this exception might provide a mechanism by which small turtles become household pets. \"Turtles, like other reptiles, commonly carry _Salmonella_, and fecal carriage rates can be as high as 90 percent (1). Small turtles sold as pets frequently come from breeding farms, where turtles are housed in crowded ponds and nesting areas in a way that promotes _Salmonella_ transmission (7). Attempts to treat turtles, turtle eggs, and turtle breeding ponds with antibiotics to eliminate _Salmonella_ have not been successful and have resulted in a high prevalence of antibiotic resistance (7,8). Other treatments reduce but do not eliminate shedding from turtles (8), and the turtles that continue to shed might recontaminate other turtles during rearing or shipment. Because shedding might be intermittent and stress related, determining whether turtles are free of the bacteria is difficult (1). \"Direct or indirect contact with a reptile is associated with an estimated 6 percent of human salmonellosis in the USA (9). Persons coming into contact with reptiles, reptile habitats, or surfaces contaminated with reptile fecal matter risk infection from salmonellae shed by the reptile (10). Although most reptiles carry _Salmonella_, small turtles are likely to be handled differently than other reptiles and thus carry a greater risk of transmitting _Salmonella_ to children. In contrast to the obvious risk for a bite or scratch, for example, from a snake or an iguana, a small turtle is likely to be perceived as safe, and thus might be given directly to small children to play with. In addition, a young child placed in charge of caring for a turtle has direct contact with water in the turtle habitat, where salmonellae are likely to multiply to high numbers. Although approximately half of the infections associated with this outbreak occurred in young children, who are at greater risk for severe illness from salmonellosis (2,10), several illnesses occurred in adults with turtle exposure, demonstrating that turtle-associated salmonellosis is not unique to children. Additionally, only 20 percent of case-patients interviewed reported awareness of the link between salmonellosis and contact with reptiles, indicating that measures to educate the public about this link have not been successful. CDC has provided recommendations to prevent reptile-associated salmonellosis in humans (2). However, because of the particular hazard associated with small turtles, prohibiting the sale and distribution of small turtles likely remains the most effective public health action to prevent turtle-associated salmonellosis.<br><br><strong> References </strong><br> 1.

One of the cases is out of Whitfield County. Within the past 2 weeks, 2 puppies and a kitten have been confirmed by the Georgia Public Health Laboratory as having rabies. All 3 pets were too young to get the rabies vaccine. One of the puppies was in Whitfield County and the other was in Gilmer County, while the kitten was in Cherokee County. In each case, the pet was attacked by a rabid wild animal and bitten in the head, but it was not reported to veterinarians or health authorities until rabies symptoms developed in the pet. The Georgia DPH says the time between being bitten by the wild animal and onset of rabies symptoms was very short because the head bites were close to the brain. The rabies virus only travels through the nervous system to the brain, not through blood or other organs. The closer a bite is from the brain, the shorter time it takes to reach the brain. The wild animals that transmitted rabies to the puppies and kitten were a skunk, a raccoon and, possibly, a coyote. The Georgia DPH says the fact that these unrelated cases occurred in separate areas of the North Georgia Health District within the past 2 weeks is a coincidence, and even more coincidental is that all pets involved were too young to have been vaccinated. Pets must be at least 3 months old to be vaccinated against rabies. Parents are strongly cautioned to keep children away from wild animals, strays and unvaccinated pets that may have been in contact with wild animals. Vaccinate all dogs and cats at 3 months of age and no later. The Georgia DPH says wild carnivores are the animals most likely to spread rabies to pets and humans, including raccoons, skunks, foxes, bobcats, and coyotes. It is also not uncommon for persons to acquire rabies from bats. Any bite or other physical contact with a bat or any of these wild carnivores should be evaluated by a medical professional for rabies exposure. Even finding a bat in a bedroom where a person has been sleeping is cause for alarm and should be reported. Human deaths from rabies in the United States are rare, but because rabies is almost always fatal once symptoms begin to develop in a human, the only prevention is anti-rabies treatments given as soon as possible after exposure to rabies. If given in time, the treatments are 100 percent effective in preventing rabies. Only a small minority of wild animals carries and transmits rabies, so indiscriminate killing of them is not warranted. If these types of wild animals or domestic animals seem to be behaving strangely or displaying symptoms suggestive of a neurological illness, contact a veterinarian and the county Environmental Health office at once. Livestock animals are also susceptible to rabies but can be vaccinated by a veterinarian. Rabies vaccinations are strongly recommended for show livestock and any livestock with which humans have regular contact such as riding horses. Contact the local Environmental Health Office for questions about rabies or to report an incident that may involve rabies. Contact information for Environmental Health offices in the North Georgia Health District is available at .

Lso has since also been associated with yellowing diseases of other solanaceous crops (physalis, tomatillo, aubergine, tamarillo, tobacco) and some crops in the family Apiaceae (carrot, celery). Main vectors of Lso are the potato psyllid (_Bactericera cockerelli_) in solanaceous host and carrot psyllids (_Trioza apicalis_, _Bactericera trigonica_) in Apiaceae. These vectors have a much wider host range than the HLB vector and additional vector species are also being identified, further extending potential host range and economic impact of Lso. Currently the Lso species is divided into 5 haplotypes: A and B affecting Solanaceae; and C, D and E affecting Apiaceae. Both groups of haplotypes have been reported from the Americas and New Zealand. Carrot haplotypes have previously been reported from several European countries (ProMED-mail posts http://promedmail.org/post/20120713.1199961, http://promedmail.org/post/20151009.3702151 & http://promedmail.org/post/20161130.4666613), northern Africa (ProMED-mail post http://promedmail.org/post/20141121.2978030) and the Middle East (ProMED-mail post http://promedmail.org/post/20170130.4803773). Potato haplotypes A & B are still considered absent from the European/Mediterranean region. The item above represents the first report of potatoes being affected by Lso in Europe, as well as the first report of a haplotype being able to affect both Apiaceae and Solanaceae. It is not stated, however, whether typical zebra chip symptoms were observed in the potatoes infected with haplotype E. Nevertheless, these findings add important information to the knowledge of epidemiology, biology and distribution of Lso worldwide.

There were signs in early July 2017 that the epidemic was peaking, at around 50 confirmed cases, but a new case was discovered on 12 Jul 2017. However, industry leaders remain hopeful that the epidemic is levelling off. \"At least the number of cases has slowed down, which is a good sign,\" said Andrew Dickson, general manager of the Manitoba Pork Council. \"It means the curve is going the other way rather than up.\" PED virus can affect all pigs and is often fatal to newborns. It's primarily transmitted through feces. People, equipment, trucks, feed, and other vectors can move the disease from site to site. The 1st case of this year 2017 was confirmed on 2 May 2017. All of the 52 cases of PED have been confined to southeastern Manitoba, but it has affected about 25 percent of all barns in the region east of the Red River and south of the Trans-Canada Highway. \"There are 200 odd barns in the area,\" Dickson said. One positive sign is that sites where the disease was 1st detected in early May 2017 have gotten rid of their infected pigs and could be a month or 2 away from restocking the barns, Dickson added. Scott Peters, a Manitoba Pork director, doesn't have PED at his feeder barn near Steinbach, but he's extremely aware of the threat. \"Our feeder barn is right in the middle of it. It's now a mile away, on 3 sides (of the feeder barn),\" he said at a Keystone Agricultural Producers meeting in Brandon on 13 Jul 2017. \"I can't imagine it not coming across our site, shortly.\" He said everyone in the industry is doing whatever they can to increase biosecurity, but there is a sense that little more can be done to contain the virus. \"I would say the mood is generally frustration,\" he said. \"If you talk to any of the managers on farm, they've done absolutely everything they can do to stick to their biosecurity measures. ... They kind of throw their hands up and say, 'there's nothing left for me to do.'\" Industry leaders and veterinarians are investigating the causes of the disease spread. In some cases, it's suspected that employees moving from barn to barn at one site may have spread the infection. At other sites, it may have been a failure to wash equipment brought onto the farm. However, there are other situations where the source remains a puzzle. \"What's thrown us off, is why is this happening?\" Dickson said. \"In some cases, we think protocols weren't followed to the T. ... In other cases, we just can't figure it out.\" PED virus, which 1st appeared in North America in 2013, was detected in Manitoba in 2014, 2015 and 2016. However, this outbreak is much larger. \"We had only 10 cases in 3 years in total. This year 2017, we've suddenly got 50,\" Dickson said. \"This year, the difference is that it got into some of the bigger systems and because they're moving so many animals.\" One location of concern is assembly yards in southeastern Manitoba, where animals and hog trucks come and go, Dickson said. \"They test regularly,\" he said. \"They may not be (infected), but there's no guarantee that somebody hasn't brought, by accident, an animal that is infected.\" It's possible that another source, besides people, is transmitting the disease to barns. The Manitoba Pork Council is looking at all possibilities, including feed. U.S. research has demonstrated that animal disease viruses can live in feed for weeks. \"There's testing going on right now of feed storage structures, equipment, feed trucks ... and looking at the feed mills themselves,\" Dickson said. \"We're not trying to point fingers at anybody, but is this a potential method of spreading it? It may not be.\" As of 13 Jul 2017, Manitoba Agriculture said there are 52 confirmed cases of PED in the province this year 2017. Byline: Robert Arnason  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\.

2017;23(9):1609-1611.<br><br><strong> Antimicrobial drug-resistant Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ infections, Michigan, USA -</strong><br> Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ (STEC) also called enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ - EHEC - Mod.LL contributes to 265 000 cases of foodborne illness annually in the USA (1). Most infections are caused by O157 strains; however, non-O157 EHEC infections have increased (2). Antimicrobial drug resistance among EHEC has been reported (3-5) but is probably underestimated. Given the importance of resistance in _E. coli_ pathotypes, we sought to determine the prevalence of resistant EHEC infections and assess the effects of resistance on disease. We obtained 358 STEC isolates from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) Reference Laboratory (Lansing, MI, USA), collected during 2010-2014. Of these, 14 were outbreak associated. We examined one strain per outbreak using protocols approved by Michigan State University and MDHHS. Overall, 31 (8.8 per cent) strains (23 non-O157, 8 O157) were resistant to antimicrobial drugs (table for table and figures, see original URL - Mod.LL). Resistance to ampicillin (7.4 per cent) was the commonest, followed by trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT) (4.0 per cent) and ciprofloxacin (0.3 per cent). Compared with national rates, resistance to ampicillin and SXT was higher, but not significantly different, for O157 isolates from Michigan (figure 1) (6). One strain was resistant to all drugs, and all resistant strains had high MICs (ampicillin, >64 ug/mL; ciprofloxacin, >32 ug/mL; SXT, in 1:19 ratio, >32/608 ug/mL). Notably, resistance was twice as common for non-O157 (11.1 per cent) than for O157 (5.5 per cent) strains. O111 strains (n=7) had significantly higher resistance frequencies (24.1 per cent) than other non-O157 serogroups (p=0.03). We found variation by year and season; resistance frequencies were highest in 2012 (figure 2) and during winter/spring (table 1), but neither trend was significant. We also observed a strong but nonsignificant association between resistance and hospitalization but no association for urban versus rural residence (7) or county after stratifying by prescription rates (8) in the univariate analyses. We conducted a multivariate analysis using logistic regression, with hospitalization as the dependent variable; we included variables with significant (p 7.

Regarding the use of antimicrobials in EHEC is often a moot point since in most cases they are not utilized, at least early, because of the increased risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome but is relevant in cases where embarrassment of the colonic lumen occurs. In the large _E. coli_ O104:H4 outbreak in northern Germany, antimicrobial therapy was used especially in those cases where the colon was perforated. In those reports, the carbapenem antimicrobials also did not increase toxin production. Whether these effects are strain specific is not clear at this time so should not necessarily be generalized to all EHEC. Of note, the _E. coli_ O104:H4 strain is a genetic hybrid between EHEC and enteroaggregative _E. coli_ and not thought to be a zoonosis. Extraintestinal invasive strains of EHEC (ProMED-mail.

The patient is a 45-year-old man with recent travel from Jordan. He returned to Italy on 25 May 2013 with symptoms of cough and fatigue. His condition deteriorated and he was hospitalised on 28 May 2013. He is currently in stable condition.  Laboratory test was conducted by the influenza reference laboratory of Tuscany and confirmed by the National Influenza Center of the Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0.  Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 51 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 30 deaths.  WHO has received reports of laboratory-confirmed cases originating in the following countries in the Middle East to date: Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). France, Germany, Italy, Tunisia and the United Kingdom also reported laboratory-confirmed cases; they were either transferred there for care of the disease or returned from the Middle East and subsequently became ill. In France, Tunisia and the United Kingdom, there has been limited local transmission among patients who had not been to the Middle East but had been in close contact with the laboratory-confirmed or probable cases.  Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.  Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. Specimens from patients\u2019 lower respiratory tracts should be obtained for diagnosis where possible. Clinicians are reminded that MERS-CoV infection should be considered even with atypical signs and symptoms, such as diarrhoea, in patients who are immunocompromised.  Health care facilities are reminded of the importance of systematic implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC). Health care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health care workers and visitors.  All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.  WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

Zika virus (or Zika) has been reported in Grenada. Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in Grenada are infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:  Women who are pregnant:  Do not travel to Grenada.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to Grenada or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers considering pregnancy:  Before you or your partner travel, talk to your health care provider about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection.  Wait before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.  If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex &ndash; or do not have sex &ndash; for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex, or do not have sex, for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy  Talk to your health care provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you&rsquo;re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Wait at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  Men are advised to wait longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.gov  Contact CDC  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  1600 Clifton Road  Atlanta ,  GA  30329-4027  USA  800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)  Contact CDC-INFO  TOP", "dates": [" Page created: May 12 2016", " Page last updated: August 08 2017", " Page last reviewed: August 08 2017", " 30329-4027", " 800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)"], "title": ["Zika Virus in Grenada"]}, "76": {"sentences": "   Sun 20 Aug 2017 13:39 BST Source: International Business Times edited Thousands of British pork lovers may already be infected by a strain of hepatitis transmitted by some products which are imported and being sold at a leading UK supermarket, according to fresh analysis compiled by scientists from Public Health England (PHE). Experts traced the shopping habits of 60 infected people to a form of own-brand sausages from a retailer known only as \"supermarket X\". The British government has declined to name the specific shop, but multiple sources reportedly told The Sunday Times that it was Tesco. The strain, hepatitis E, is typically found in pork products imported into the UK from Europe. According to the PHE website, signs of the disease in humans vary from no symptoms to liver failure. In rare cases, it can prove fatal, particularly in pregnant women. This week (20 Aug 2017), the Sunday Times reported that research completed back in 2016 was withheld from publication until now over alleged \"sensitivity\". Scientists believe that imported pork products infect 150 000-200 000 British citizens a year. The paper said: \"The implicated products are pork sausages, which require cooking prior to consumption, and ready-to-eat pre-packed sliced ham.\" It noted that \"Only supermarket X, especially own brand, was significantly associated with the virus.\" Tesco has not commented on the findings, but told The Sunday Times that it had already started a conversation with the Food Standards Agency (FSA) about how to minimize the spread of such viruses. \"The association with the supermarket does not infer any blame,\" PHE said. One scientist, professor Richard Tedder of the government's National Infection Service agency, agreed. \"Something appears to have changed in animal husbandry so too many pigs are infected at slaughter. This is a problem for meat producers and all retailers, not just one.\" Person to person transmission of the virus is very rare, however it has been known to pass on via blood transfusions, PHE has said. The numbers of confirmed hepatitis E cases and infections increased significantly between 2010 and 2016, it warned. According to a report on PigWorld  , a spokesperson from the National Pig Association (NPA) acknowledged the sudden spike in cases but said that \"further research and surveillance\" was required to \"determine the true cause of the rise in hepatitis E cases in the UK.\" The statement continued: \"NPA recommends that consumers follow the advice from the Food Standards Agency that pork and sausages should be cooked thoroughly until steaming hot throughout, with no pink or red in the center, to greatly reduce the risk of infection. Pork products associated with human infection caused by an emerging phylotype of hepatitis E virus in England and Wales. Epidemiol Infect. 2017; 145(12): 2417-23. doi: 10.1017/S0950268817001388.<br><br><strong> Epub 2017 Jul 31;  Abstract </strong><br> \"Since 2010, human hepatitis E infections have increased in England and Wales. Most cases are locally acquired and caused by hepatitis E virus genotype 3 (HEV G3). HEV G3 is linked to the consumption of pork products. The increase is associated with the emergence of a new phylotype, HEV G3-group 2 (G3-2, also known as G3abcdhij). 60 individuals with confirmed hepatitis E infection and no history of travel outside the UK were recruited: 19 were infected with HEV G3-group 1 (G3-1 or G3efg) and 41 with G3-2. Epidemiological data relating to usual shopping habits and consumption of ham and sausages were analysed together with typing data to identify any associations with HEV phylotype. Study participants who purchased ham and/or sausage from a major supermarket were more likely to have HEV G3-2 infection (relative risks 1.85, P = 0\u00b706, CI 0\u00b797-3\u00b753). The HEV G3-2 phylotype has not been detected in indigenous UK pigs and it is suggested that human infections could be the result of consumption of products made from pork originating outside the UK. This does not infer blame on the supermarket but the epidemiology of HEV is dynamic and reflects complex animal husbandry practices which need to be explored further.\" This report underscores the importance of zoonotic hepatitis E (primarily genotype 3) as the cause of hepatitis E emergence in Europe. There are currently 7 genotypes of HEV and genotypes 1 and 2 are not zoonotic and cause most of the HEV infections in Africa and Asia. It is these genotypes that cause increased morbidity and mortality in pregnant women. Most of the zoonotic hepatitis E cases have been recognized in the developed world, are associated with foodborne disease (usually undercooked pork products) and are caused by genotype 3. In addition, infection with genotype 3 when occurring in immunocompromised hosts (especially solid organ transplant recipients) can cause chronic infection which can progress to cirrhosis. Ribavirin has been used to treat such individuals with chronic infection. The author's summary of their work states \"Study participants who purchased ham and/or sausage from a major supermarket were more likely to have HEV G3-2 infection (Relative risks 1.85, P = 0\u00b706, CI 0\u00b797-3\u00b753)\" although the posting above quotes the paper (?in the full text which is not available to this moderator) as \"Only supermarket X, especially own brand, was significantly associated with the virus.\" The statistics noted in the summary gives a relative risk of 1.85 which supports an increased risk of almost 2 times but the p value of 0.06 and a confidence interval overlapping 1.0 both do not reach statistical significance so \"more likely\" is better than \"significantly associated\". Be that as it may, there is no doubt that acquisition of zoonotic HEV in Europe is clearly linked to ingestion of undercooked pork products that was carrying the virus. Adequate cooking and appropriate kitchen practices to avoid cross-contamination will minimize, if not erase totally, this risk. - Mod.LL   .

This animal never entered slaughter channels and at no time presented a risk to the food supply, or to human health in the United States. USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service's (APHIS) National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) have determined that this cow was positive for atypical (L-type) BSE. The animal was showing clinical signs and was found through routine surveillance at an Alabama livestock market. APHIS and Alabama veterinary officials are gathering more information on the case. BSE is not contagious and exists in 2 types - classical and atypical. Classical BSE is the form that occurred primarily in the United Kingdom, beginning in the late 1980's, and it has been linked to variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in people. The primary source of infection for classical BSE is feed contaminated with the infectious prion agent, such as meat-and-bone meal containing protein derived from rendered infected cattle. Regulations from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have prohibited the inclusion of mammalian protein in feed for cattle and other ruminants since 1997 and have also prohibited high risk tissue materials in all animal feed since 2009. Atypical BSE is different, and it generally occurs in older cattle, usually 8 years of age or greater. It seems to arise rarely and spontaneously in all cattle populations. This is the nation's 5th detection of BSE. Of the 4 previous U.S. cases, the 1st was a case of classical BSE that was imported from Canada; the rest have been atypical (H- or L-type) BSE. The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) has recognized the United States as negligible risk for BSE. As noted in the OIE guidelines for determining this status, atypical BSE cases do not impact official BSE risk status recognition as this form of the disease is believed to occur spontaneously in all cattle populations at a very low rate. Therefore, this finding of an atypical case will not change the negligible risk status of the United States, and should not lead to any trade issues. The United States has a longstanding system of interlocking safeguards against BSE that protects public and animal health in the United States, the most important of which is the removal of specified risk materials - or the parts of an animal that would contain BSE should an animal have the disease - from all animals presented for slaughter. The 2nd safeguard is a strong feed ban that protects cattle from the disease. Another important component of our system - which led to this detection - is our ongoing BSE surveillance program that allows USDA to detect the disease if it exists at very low levels in the U.S. cattle population.

The last US bovine BSE case was identified in 2012 in California; reports for this and the other H- and L- type BSEs and the singular classical BSE animal are listed below. The US does an outstanding job in preventing new cases of BSE and in quickly recognising the spontaneous sporadic atypical variants. We are fortunate, and cheap at the price.

Outbreak of sudden death with acute encephalitis syndrome among children associated with exposure to lychee orchards in Northern Bangladesh, 2012. Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2017; doi:10.4269/ajtmh.<br><br><strong>16-0856; available on line 24 Jul 2017 -</strong><br> Abstract Recurrent outbreaks of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) among children in lychee growing areas in Asia highlight the need to better understand the etiology and the context. We conducted a mixed-methods study to identify risk factors for disease, and behaviors and practices around lychee cultivation in an AES outbreak community in northern Bangladesh in 2012. The outbreak affected 14 children; 13 died. The major symptoms included unconsciousness, convulsion, excessive sweating, and frothy discharge. The median time from illness onset to unconsciousness was 2.5 hours. The outbreak corresponded with lychee harvesting season. Multiple pesticides including some banned in Bangladesh were frequently used in the orchards. Visiting a lychee orchard within 24 hours before onset (age-adjusted odds ratio aOR = 11.6 1.02-109.8) and 3 days (aOR = 7.2 1.4-37.6), and family members working in a lychee orchard (aOR = 7.2 1.7-29.4) and visiting any garden while pesticides were being applied (aOR = 4.9 1.0-19.4) in 3 days preceding illness onset were associated with illness in nearby village analysis. In neighborhood analysis, visiting an orchard that used pesticides (aOR = 8.4 1.4-49.9) within 3 days preceding illness onset was associated with illness. Eating lychees was not associated with illness in the case-control study. The outbreak was linked to lychee orchard exposures where agrochemicals were routinely used, but not to consumption of lychees. Lack of acute specimens was a major limitation. Future studies should target collection of environmental and food samples, acute specimens, and rigorous assessment of community use of pesticides to determine etiology. Discussion The clinical manifestations in case-patients including sudden onset without a prodromal phase, becoming unconscious within a median of 2.5 hours of illness onset, and the short duration between onset of illness to death all suggest that the outbreak was more likely due to a toxic poisoning than an infection. The outbreak was restricted to the lychee season and to a geographic area in which lychees are grown, which suggests that this outbreak of AES may be linked to exposure to lychees or lychee orchards. In India, the leading hypothesis of AES etiology among children living near lychee orchards was the ingestion of phytotoxins, specifically methylenecyclopropylglycine that is present in lychee seeds and pulp, which can lead to hypoglycemia among malnourished children. Without acute biological specimens, and therefore, lack of measured blood glucose levels from children in this outbreak in Bangladesh, we were unable to investigate this hypothesis directly. However, our epidemiologic and clinical findings suggest that methylenecyclopropyl-glycine alone may not explain this AES outbreak among children. There are multiple lines of evidence that agrochemical poisoning may also have contributed. In our study, the signs and symptoms are also consistent with acute pesticide poisoning in children reported in different countries of the world. The outbreak ended following the onset of the monsoon rains, which suggest that the toxin associated with the lychees was on their surface, rather than contained in the fruit. In India, a similar pattern was observed, where the number of cases peaked in mid-June and declined immediately after the onset of monsoon rains. Moreover, the findings of washing fruits and vegetables protective against lychee-associated illness in India further supports our assertion that toxin associated with the lychees may be on the surface. Finally, in India, mortality decline among AES case-patients after rapid correction of hypoglycemia with intravenous dextrose. Although we were unable to measure blood glucose level among the case-patients, however, distribution of blood glucose meter among clinician may help identifying patients with hypoglycemia and rapid correction of hypoglycemia with intravenous glucose may reduce mortality in children in Bangladesh.  communicated by: ProMED-mail The authors indicate that studies based on hospital records and retrospective interviews have significant limitations in confirming the etiology of AES and establishing agrochemical intoxication as the causative factor. One hopes that this study will stimulate prospective studies of AES that will include laboratory supported toxicology confirming exposure to specific, identified agrochemicals, and the clinical details following exposure, including incidence of hypoglycemia, a frequently mentioned condition in AES cases in India. A report based on this publication was posted on 27 Jul 2017 see Undiagnosed deaths - Bangladesh: (RP), pesticide identified, 2012 http://promedmail.org/post/20170728.5212796. However the original published report (above) provides additional detail. In the previous report, Mod.TG provided relevant toxicological information that follows. - Mod.TY \"Endosulfan, a commercial product of 2 isomers, is a chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticide. As such, it may be used as wood preservative, but is also a contact poison for many insects and mites. Therefore it has been used on food crops, such as vegetables, grains, fruits and teas to rid these crops of damaging pests. \"Endosulfan is a highly toxic substance whose toxicity is partly dependent upon how the pesticide is applied. The body absorption is rapid in the presence of alcohols, oils or other emulsifiers (on the skin or in the preparation), but otherwise is slowly and incompletely absorbed by the body. \"Generally endosulfan appears to affect the central nervous system. Acute symptoms include incoordination, agitation, convulsion and even loss of consciousness. Other symptoms include vomiting, and diarrhea.

Department of Disease Control (DDC) chief Dr Jessada Chokdamrongsuk reported on Mon 28 Aug 2017, that 1978 cases of melioidosis had been reported from 1 Jan 2017 to 22 Aug 2017. The disease, caused by the bacterium _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ and prevalent during the rainy season in the subtropics, peaks every August in Thailand and has been wider spread this year 2017, he said. \"The bacterium thrives in contaminated water and soil and infects humans and animals through direct contact. People could get infected from prolonged exposure to contaminated water or soil, especially if they have any open sores or lesions in the skin,\" Jessada said. \"Infection can also come from consuming contaminated water or food.\" Melioidosis produces a variety of acute and severe symptoms, he said, including long-lasting fever with no other apparent cause, ulcers or abscesses in the lungs, liver or spleen, and blood infections. The disease, which mainly affects adults, can be fatal, he said. Death has been known to result within 2-3 days of admission to hospital. Risk factors for infection include chronic respiratory and lung disease, tuberculosis, diabetes, chronic renal disease, thalassemia, cancer, and immune-suppressing conditions unrelated to HIV. Jessada advised people coming into regular contact with floodwater to wear boots, drink only water that has been boiled, avoid raw and partially cooked food, wash immediately after exposure and seek medical attention if a fever persists for more than 5 days or abscesses become chronic.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Melioidosis is a disease of the rainy season in its endemic areas. It mainly affects people who have direct contact with soil and water. Many have an underlying predisposing condition such as diabetes (commonest risk factor), renal disease, cirrhosis, thalassemia, alcohol dependence, immunosuppressive therapy, chronic obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and excess kava consumption. Kava is an herbal member of the pepper family that can be associated with chronic liver disease. Melioidosis may present at any age, but peaks in the 4th and 5th decades of life, affecting men more than women. In addition, although severe fulminating infection can and does occur in healthy individuals, severe disease and fatalities are much less common in those without risk factors. The most commonly recognized presentation of melioidosis is pneumonia, associated with high fever, significant muscle aches, chest pain, and  although the cough can be nonproductive  respiratory secretions can be purulent, significant in quantity, and associated with on-and-off bright, red blood. The lung infection can be rapidly fatal  with bacteremia and shock  or somewhat more indolent. Acute melioidosis septicemia is the most severe complication of the infection. It presents as a typical sepsis syndrome with hypotension, high cardiac output, and low systemic vascular resistance. In many cases, a primary focus in the soft tissues or lung can be found. The syndrome, usually in patients with risk factor comorbidities, is characteristically associated with multiple abscesses involving the cutaneous tissues, the lung, the liver, and spleen, and a very high mortality rate of 80 to 95 percent. With prompt optimal therapy, the case fatality rate can be decreased to 40 to 50 percent. The melioidosis bacillus is intrinsically insensitive to many antimicrobials. It should be noted that bioterrorism strains may be engineered to be even more resistant. _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ is usually inhibited by tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT), antipseudomonal penicillins, carbapenems, ceftazidime, and amoxicillin/clavulanate or ampicillin/sulbactam. Ceftriaxone and cefotaxime have good in vitro activity but poor efficacy; and cefepime did not appear, as well, to be equivalent to ceftazidime in a mouse model. The unusual antimicrobial profile of resistance to colistin and polymyxin B and the aminoglycosides but sensitivity to amoxicillin/clavulanate is a useful tool to consider in treatment of infection with the organism. The randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing melioidosis treatment have been reviewed, and it was found that the formerly standard therapy of chloramphenicol, doxycycline, and SXT combination had a higher mortality rate than therapy with ceftazidime, imipenem/cilastatin, or amoxicillin/clavulanate (or ampicillin/sulbactam). The betalactam-betalactamase inhibitor therapy, however, seemed to have a higher failure rate. Source: Tolaney P, Lutwick LI: Melioidosis. In: Lutwick LI, Lutwick SM (eds).

Graziers have also been told that the risk of infection from new stock purchases is also a possibility. Key points: - highly infectious bacterial disease of the hoof in sheep and goats - causes serious production losses and control costs - legally notifiable disease, requiring quarantine - normally associated with moist or wet conditions - dozens of sheep properties across western NSW have been quarantined amid a worrying outbreak of the disease that rots away the animal's foot. Footrot is a bacterial infection of the hoof, known to be more prevalent in wet conditions but authorities say they are receiving reports of continuing infection spread despite the dry conditions. Local Land Services veterinarian Jillian Kelly said the NSW central west was a particular hot spot, with about 45 properties under quarantine. \"That equates to about 150 000 sheep in our region,\" she said. \"But we have been talking to other regions and they are all experiencing an increase in prevalence.\" Dr Kelly said many sheep producers had not seen incidents of footrot in their flocks for years. She said some were not as familiar with the signs as farmers might have been during times of high prevalence in the 1980s and 1990s. \"The other thing we are seeing at the moment is that the signs are not as extreme as people might be expecting,'' Dr Kelly said. \"Back in the '80s and '90s, when footrot was everywhere, the signs would make the sheep really lame.\" \"What we are finding this time around is that the sheep are not that lame, sometimes it doesn't smell as bad as it used to, people might be fooled into thinking it's something else. The signs might be quite mild, but it is still virulent footrot and it still has to be reported and controlled.\" Dr Kelly said the Central West Local Land Services was operating at full capacity to deal with the outbreak and that extra staff had been put on to deal with the outbreak. \"We are also seeing footrot at livestock sale yards in the region on a regular basis and that is quite concerning.\" She said there was concern about what might happen if spring rain caused the outbreak to worsen. byline: Sally Bryant, Gavin Coote  communicated by: ProMED-mail Footrot is generally classified as either virulent or benign. This outbreak is classified as virulent, by the regulatory definition. This means the disease is quite debilitating, and painful. When diseases affecting the feet are so severe, then the sheep often lose weight, have poor growth rates, and suffer from poor wool quality and growth. Debilitated animals are generally susceptible to more fly strikes, and more severe fly strikes, which are often from the blow fly. This will reduce the value of the animal. Controlling the fly strikes as well as controlling the disease can be a costly process for the producer. Footrot is a contagious bacterial disease of sheep and goats, caused by the organism _Dichelobacter nodosus_ (_D. nodosus_) in association with a number of other bacteria. This particular bacterium affects sheep and goats with similar disastrous consequences. The severity, the virulence, and the contagious nature make this disease notifiable or reportable to the authorities (the Department of Primary Industries). As the article noted, this produces lameness as it is quite painful, and is often associated with an odor. Generally producers recognize the horrible odor and have a diagnosis almost from the smell. But if the odor is reduced this year it may be harder to recognize the cause. We wish these producers well at early detection and prevention of this disease. - Mod.TG   .

She said the bat bite felt like tiny needles. The bat was later trapped by firefighters at the scene and was tested for rabies. A day later she was contacted and told that the bat did in fact carry the disease. Now KK is undergoing a series of rather expensive rabies treatments, which according to her have been in excess of USD 4000. Without insurance it is a costly burden to bear.

A measles outbreak has been reported in Romania. CDC recommends that travelers to Romania protect themselves by making sure they are vaccinated against measles, particularly infants 6&ndash;11 months of age (1 dose of measles vaccine) and children 12 months of age or older (2 doses of measles vaccine). Clinicians should keep measles in mind when treating patients with fever and rash, especially if the patient has recently traveled internationally.  What can travelers do to protect themselves?  Get measles vaccine  People who cannot show that they were vaccinated as children and who have never had measles should be vaccinated.  Infants 6&ndash;11 months of age should have 1 dose of measles vaccine if traveling internationally.  Children in the United States routinely receive measles vaccination at 12&ndash;15 months of age.  Infants vaccinated before age 12 months should be revaccinated on or after the first birthday with 2 doses, separated by at least 28 days.  Children 12 months of age or older should have 2 doses, separated by at least 28 days.  Adolescents and adults who have not had measles or have not been vaccinated should get 2 doses, separated by at least 28 days.  Two doses of MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine is nearly 100% effective at preventing measles.MMR has been used safely and effectively since the 1970s. A few people experience mild, temporary adverse reactions, such as joint pain, from the vaccine, but serious side effects are extremely rare. There is no known link between MMR and autism.  See Vaccine Information Statements (VIS) for more information.  Practice hygiene and cleanliness  Wash your hands often.  If soap and water aren&rsquo;t available, clean your hands with hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.  Don&rsquo;t touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. If you need to touch your face, make sure your hands are clean.  Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.  Try to avoid close contact, such as kissing, hugging, or sharing eating utensils or cups, with people who are sick.  If you feel sick and think you may have measles:  Talk to your doctor or nurse if you feel seriously ill, especially if you have a fever.  Tell him or her about your travel.

An email was sent campus-wide alerting to the mumps emergence, with a list of resources via the Healthyhorns website. Mumps is a contagious and infectious viral disease that causes swelling of the parotid salivary glands in the face. Adult males contracting the disease are at risk of sterility. Complications of mumps, such as hearing loss, are potentially serious, but rare. The disease is considered to be extremely contagious. Among the symptoms of mumps are: Swollen, painful salivary glands on one or both sides of your face (parotitis); fever; headache; muscle aches; weakness and fatigue; loss of appetite; pain while chewing or swallowing. Immediate medical care is suggested for those experiencing symptoms. Yet the Mayo Clinic reports there's no specific treatment for mumps. The website notes that mumps outbreaks still occur in the United States, and mumps is still common in many parts of the world, so getting a vaccination to prevent mumps remains important. See Healthyhorns website with questions related to mumps and suggestions if felled by the disease .

Among the 26 newly reported cases, 13 are associated with a cluster in a hospital in Al Jawf Region, Saudi Arabia. The initial case was a 51-year-old reported on Wed 2 Aug 2017. To date, 12 cases have been identified through contact tracing. These cases include 8 health care workers (all asymptomatic) in the hospital where the initial case was treated, one hospital contact (a 70-year-old male) and 3 household contacts. Follow up of health care workers, hospital and household contacts are ongoing. Globally, 2066 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including at least 720 related deaths have been reported to WHO. Public health response The Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia evaluates each case and their contacts and implements measures to limit further human-to-human transmission and bring Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks under control. The measures taken by Ministry of Health officials in Saudi Arabia include:  - Risk stratification and active tracing for contacts in healthcare and in communities. High risk contacts (e.g. unprotected exposure to a case or engagement in an aerosol generating procedure) are tested by PCR regardless of having symptoms. Health care workers are exempted from work until they are cleared by infection control experts.  - Trained hospital epidemiologists have been deployed to sites within 24 hours of identifying an outbreak.  - Enforcement of strict adherence to environmental disinfection and terminal cleaning of affected areas.  - Enforcement of visual triage for respiratory diseases in emergency department and outpatient departments and ensuring the 24/7 availability of trained nurses for early detection of patients with respiratory symptoms, and proper documentation on triage forms.  - Extensive training of all health care workers on case definition for early detection, implementation of isolation precautions, proper selection, donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE), hand hygiene and environmental cleaning and disinfection.  - Ensuring availability of infection prevention supplies including hand sanitizer, PPEs, surface disinfectants, portable HEPA filters and fumigation machines.  - Ensuring that all health care workers are fit tested for high efficiency respirators.  - Implementing the policy of not allowing health care personnel working in a facility affected by an outbreak to travel or work in Hajj premises or in any healthcare facility until they are medical cleared. WHO risk assessment MERS-CoV causes severe human infections resulting in high mortality and has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings. The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals or animal products (for example, following contact with dromedaries) or human source (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information. WHO advice Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures. Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, in addition to avoiding close contact with suspected or confirmed human cases of the disease, people with these conditions should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp In summary, according to the WHO update, as of Sat 12 Aug 2017, there have been a total of 2066 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported to WHO, including at least 720 related deaths (reported case fatality rate 34.8 percent). In the period covered by the above update (4 Jul - 12 Aug 2017), there were 26 newly confirmed laboratory confirmed infections with the MERS-CoV including 8 asymptomatic infections associated with the outbreak in Dawmet Aljandal (Asir region). In addition to the 6 fatalities among these 26 newly confirmed infections, official recovery reports from the MOH were available for cases no. 1 (on Tue 11 Jul 2017), no. 3 (on Mon 31 Jul 2017), no 5 (on Thu 17 Aug 2017), and no. 9 (Tue 15 Aug 2017). Classifications of the 26 cases reported by the MOH included: A total of 8 primary cases with high risk exposures still under investigation (cases nos. 1, 2, 3, 7, 11, 20, 21, and 26) One primary case with no known high risk exposure (case no. 6) Up to 4 primary cases with contact with camels (3 direct contact, one indirect contact  cases nos. 4, 5, 8 and 12) A total of 8 secondary healthcare associated cases in healthcare workers (cases nos. 10, 15, 16, 17, 22, 23, 24, and 25) One secondary healthcare associated case in a patient (case no.19) Up to 4 secondary cases in household contacts (cases nos. 9, 13, 14 and 18) According to the WHO update, case no. 11 had a history of contact with camels that was not known at the time of the MOH report. Interpretation of the details above is that outside of the outbreak in Asir region, the pattern of transmission was primarily sporadic cases, around the country, the majority of whom were classified as primary cases with unidentified high risk exposures (8 out of 13) and the remaining 5 cases had a history of known contact with camels and camel products in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. So the question remains, what is the high risk exposure that is not being identified? .......- Mod.MPP ", "dates": ["[1] Saudi Arabia 4 new cases - Saudi MOH 12-18 Aug 2017", "[2] Saudi Arabia - WHO update 17 Aug 2017", "Date: Fri 18 Aug 2017", "Source: Saudi MOH 12-18 Aug 2017 [edited]", "As of [Fri 18 Aug 2017] there have been a total of:", "687 deaths [reported case fatality rate 40", "Since the last ProMED-mail update [Fri 11 Aug 2017] there have been a", "Date: 18 Aug 2017 (1 case)", "Date: 16 Aug 2017 (1 case)", "Date: 15 Aug 2017 (1 case)", "Date: 12 Aug 2017 (1 case)", "Date: 15 Aug 2017", "Date: 17 Aug 2017 (1 recovery)", "[reported as a newly confirmed case on [Tue 15 Aug 2017] at which time", "reported cases in Jeddah on [Wed 2 Aug 2017] there was a 57-year-old", "fatality on [Fri 4 Aug 2017] having been classified as a primary case", "Aug 2017] there was the 44-year-old expat female classified as a", "and now 12 and 14 days after the 2nd case was reported from Jeddah", "Date: 17 Aug 2017", "17 Aug 2017 [edited]", "17 Aug 2017", "Between [4 Jul 2017 and 12 Aug 2017] the national IHR Focal Point of", "MERS-CoV cases reported between [4 Jul and 12 Aug 2017]", "1 / 2017-07-04 / Hail / 57 / F / No / Yes / NA / NA / NA / 2017-06-24", "/ 2017-07-01 / 2017-07-03 / Alive", "2 / 2017-07-11 / Taif / 76 / F / No / Yes / NA / NA / NA / 2017-07-02", "/ 2017-07-08 / 2017-07-10 / Deceased / 2017-07-11", "3 / 2017-07-26 / Riyadh / 57 / M / No / No / NA / NA / NA / 2017-07-22", "/ 2017-07-24 / 2017-07-25 / Alive", "4 / 2017-07-27 / Buridah / 36 / M / No / No / Yes / Yes / No /", "2017-07-17 / 2017-07-24 / 2017-07-26 / Alive", "5 / 2017-07-29 / Khamis Mushait / 38 / M / No / No / Yes / Yes / No /", "2017-07-19 / 2017-07-26 / 2017-07-28 / Alive", "6 / 2017-08-02 / Dawmet Aljandal / 51 / M / No / Yes / No / No / No /", "2017-07-27 / 2017-07-30 / 2017-08-01 / Deceased / 2017-08-04", "7 / 2017-08-02 / Jeddah / 57 / M / No / Yes / NA / NA / No /", "2017-07-27 / 2017-07-31 / 2017-08-01 / Alive", "8 / 2017-08-02 / Aldalam / 36 / M / No / Yes / Yes / Yes / No /", "2017-07-23 / 2017-07-30 / 2017-08-01 / Alive", "9 / 2017-08-04 / Jeddah / 44 / F / No / Yes / NA / NA / Yes\u2020 /", "2017-08-02 / 2017-08-03 / 2017-08-04 / Alive", "10 / 2017-08-06 / Dawmet Aljandal / 25 / F / Yes / NA / NA / NA /", "Yes\u2020 / NA / NA / 2017-08-06 / Alive", "11 / 2017-08-06 / Najran / 38 / M / No / No / Yes / Yes / NA /", "2017-07-28 / 2017-08-03 / 2017-08-05 / Deceased / 2017-08-06", "12 / 2017-08-07 / Hail / 50 / M / No / No / Yes / Yes / NA /", "2017-07-31 / 2017-08-04 / 2017-08-07 / Deceased / 2017-08-10", "13 / 2017-08-07 / Dawmet Aljandal / 16 / M / No / No / NA / NA /", "Yes\u2020 / 2017-08-06 / 2017-08-06 / 2017-08-07 / Alive", "14 / 2017-08-07 / Dawmet Aljandal / 12 / M / No / NA / NA / NA /", "Yes\u2020 / NA / NA / 2017-08-07 / Alive", "15 / 2017-08-08 / Dawmet Aljandal / 49 / M / Yes / NA / NA / NA /", "16 / 2017-08-08 / Dawmet Aljandal / 27 / F / Yes / NA / NA / NA /", "17 / 2017-08-08 / Dawmet Aljandal / 26 / F / Yes / NA / NA / NA /", "18 / 2017-08-08 / Dawmet Aljandal / 21 / M / No / Yes / NA / NA /", "Yes\u2020 / 2017-08-06 / 2017-08-07 / 2017-08-07 / Alive", "19 / 2017-08-08 / Dawmet Aljandal / 70 / M / No / Yes / No / No /", "Yes\u2020 / 2017-08-05 / 2017-07-27** / 2017-08-07 / Deceased /", "2017-08-11", "20 / 2017-08-08 / Khamis Mushait / 58 / M / No / Yes / NA / NA / NA /", "2017-07-25 / 2017-08-03 / 2017-08-06 / Deceased / 2017-08-10", "21 / 2017-08-08 / Aloula / 55 / M / No / Yes / NA / NA / NA /", "2017-08-03 / 2017-08-05 / 2017-08-07 / Alive", "22 / 2017-08-10 / Dawmet Aljandal / 38 / F / Yes / NA / NA / NA /", "Yes\u2020 / NA / NA / 2017-06-09 / Alive", "23 / 2017-08-10 / Dawmet Aljandal / 42 / F / Yes / NA / NA / NA /", "24 / 2017-08-11 / Dawmet Aljandal / 55 / M / Yes / NA / NA / NA /", "Yes\u2020 / NA / NA / 2017-08-10 / Alive", "25 / 2017-08-11 / Dawmet Aljandal / 52 / M / Yes / NA / NA / NA /", "26 / 2017-08-12 / Baljurashi / 89 / M / No / Yes / NA / NA / No /", "2017-08-08 / 2017-08-10 / 2017-08-11 / Alive", "51-year-old reported on [Wed 2 Aug 2017]", "[In summary according to the WHO update as of [Sat 12 Aug 2017]", "the above update (4 Jul - 12 Aug 2017) there were 26 newly confirmed", " 1 (on Tue 11 Jul 2017) no", " 3 (on Mon 31 Jul 2017) no 5 (on", "Thu 17 Aug 2017) and no", " 9 (Tue 15 Aug 2017)", " 1 2 3 7 11 20 21 and 26)", " 4 5 8 and 12)", " 10 15 16 17 22 23 24 and 25)", " 9 13 14"], "title": "MERS-CoV (55): Saudi Arabia (MK, MD, BA), WHO "}, "90": {"sentences": "Not calculated because of missing information Epidemiology: Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: endemic foci Control measures: Measures applied: surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone;

The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness. As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea: \"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as \"potentially the most important medical advance\" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5). \"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.<br><br><strong>\" References </strong><br> 1.

Outbreaks of viral conjunctivitis occur mainly in tropical countries with high population density and a hot, humid climate. Since the chikungunya outbreak a few years ago, Grenada has had an active surveillance and monitoring system that has proven to be effective in subsequent outbreaks, like that of the Zika virus. The island's health ministry is encouraging people to take all necessary and preventative measures to avoid becoming infected. Red eye is very contagious  it can easily be spread from person to person  but it can be effectively treated at home. The germs are passed on to others through hand-to-hand contact when hands are not washed after contact with discharge from an infected eye. Symptoms include redness or swelling of the white of the eye or inside the eyelid, watering eye and excess tears, increased sensitivity to light, and pus or discharge from the eyelids which result in eyelids being stuck together. Byline: Joyce Loan  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Viral conjunctivitis, commonly known as pinkeye, is a common, self-limiting condition that is typically caused by adenovirus. Other viruses that can be responsible for conjunctival infection include herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), picornavirus (enterovirus 70, Coxsackie A24), poxvirus (molluscum contagiosum, vaccinia), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Viral conjunctivitis is highly contagious, usually for 10-12 days from onset as long as the eyes are red. Patients should avoid touching their eyes, shaking hands, and sharing towels, napkins, pillow cases, and other fomites, among other activities. Transmission may occur through accidental inoculation of viral particles from the patient's hands or by contact with infected upper respiratory droplets, fomites, or contaminated swimming pools. The infection usually resolves spontaneously within 2-4 weeks (extracted from  ). Treatment of adenoviral conjunctivitis is supportive. No evidence exists that demonstrates the efficacy of specific antiviral agents other than topical ganciclovir. A combination topical agent that contains betadine and low-dose dexamethasone is currently in confirmatory phase III clinical trials as a broad-spectrum agent for the treatment of adenovirus, HSV, VZV, and other forms of infectious conjunctivitis.UBA ", "dates": ["Date: Fri 14 Jul 2017", "estimated at between 500 and 600 cases per week in Guadeloupe and 150"], "title": "Conjunctivitis -

Rift Valley fever virus and European mosquitoes: vector competence of _Culex pipiens_ and _Stegomyia albopicta_ (_Aedes albopictus_). Med Vet Entomol. 2017 Aug 7. doi: 10.1111/mve.12254.<br><br><strong> Epub ahead of print  Abstract </strong><br> Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne disease caused by the Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). Rift Valley fever affects a large number of species, including human, and has severe impact on public health and the economy, especially in African countries. The present study examined the vector competence of 3 different European mosquito species, _Culex pipiens_ (Linnaeus, 1758) form _molestus_ (Diptera: Culicidae), _Cx. pipiens_ hybrid form, and _Stegomyia albopicta_ (_Aedes albopictus_) (Skuse, 1894) (Diptera: Culicidae). Mosquitoes were artificially fed with blood containing RVFV. Infection, disseminated infection and transmission efficiency were evaluated. This is the 1st study to assess the transmission efficiency of European mosquito species using a virulent RVFV strain. The virus disseminated in _Cx. pipiens_ hybrid form and in _S. albopicta_. Moreover, infectious viral particles were isolated from saliva of both species, showing their RVFV transmission capacity. The presence of competent _Cx. pipiens_ and _S. albopicta_ in Spain indicates that an autochthonous outbreak of RVF may occur if the virus is introduced. These findings provide information that will help health authorities to set up efficient entomological surveillance and RVFV vector control programmes.  <br><br>Communicated by: Shamsudeen Fagbo RVFV can move outside the traditionally endemic sub-Saharan region and into other regions, as demonstrated in the past in Comoros Islands, Madagascar, Egypt, and the Arabian Peninsula. In addition to these regions, which are geographically adjacent to RVFV-endemic countries, in other more distant areas of the world the ecological infrastructure exists to allow RVFV to potentially thrive in vector, wildlife, livestock, and human hosts. The virus could be purposefully introduced into new areas as a tactic of bioterrorism, or moved accidentally via viremic mosquitoes (including infected mosquito eggs), humans, wildlife, or livestock along the extensive networks of global transportation, expanding the range of the virus to other continents. Humans, for instance, may develop RVFV viremia sufficient to infect naive mosquitoes. Laboratory studies have demonstrated that European as well as North American mosquito species of medical or veterinary importance can become infected with and transmit RVFV (see also Table 2 in ref 1 below). Prevention might best be exercised through vigilance and monitoring of RVF activity in endemic settings and increased vigilance for RVFV at high-risk locations in other continents that are connected to these endemic areas. An extensive discussion of the issue can be found in a recent US-government sponsored review (1).<br><br><strong> Reference -</strong><br> 1. Linthicum, KJ, Britch, SC, Anyamba, A.

This is the first MERS-CoV case in Austria.  Details of the case reported are as follows  The case is a 29 year old female citizen of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (SAU), who travelled on 22 September 2014 to Vienna, Austria on a flight from Doha, Qatar. She had originally travelled from Affif, SAU, via Riyadh, by car. The case was symptomatic with an upper respiratory infection and fever prior to arrival in Austria.  The patient sought medical treatment in Austria on 24 September 2014, and was transferred to a private hospital on 26 September and then, on 28 September 2014, to the reference hospital for highly infectious diseases in Vienna. The patient is currently in a stable condition. No exposure to camels or their products, no prior hospital admission, nor contact to a known MERS-CoV case, nor any sick person has been reported.  The MERS-CoV infection was laboratory confirmed on 29 September 2014 by RT-PCR targeting 2 distinct targets. A further target was confirmed positive on 30 September 2014.  Public health response  All of the contacts identified in Austria have been informed about the disease and are being followed up by Austrian health authorities. So far 2 close contacts have presented with upper respiratory symptoms and are admitted to hospital. Laboratory results of these contacts are pending as of 30 September 2014.  The Austrian health authorities assume that the patient was infectious prior to, and during the international flights. Follow-up with passengers on the flight is ongoing and personal data of the crew on the flight has been communicated to Qatar.  WHO is facilitating contacts between the IHR NFPs of Austria and SAU to allow for exchange of information, and identification and follow-up of contacts of the case in SAU. Contact tracing will depend on the availability of the passenger data.  Globally, 853 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including at least 301 related deaths have officially been reported to WHO.  WHO advice  With the annual pilgrimage of Hajj underway, WHO encourages Member States to review WHO\u2019s travel advice on MERS-CoV for pilgrimages, published in June 2014.  Read the travel advice on MERS-CoV for pilgrimages  Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.  Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.  Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS\u2010CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.  Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.  WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

Mod.TY, edited A new suspected case of a hantavirus infection in Purranque Los Lagos region was taken to the Temuco hospital Araucan\u00eda region. The affected individual is a 24 year old agricultural worker who had contracted the virus in Purranque. After testing positive in the rapid test, the man was immediately taken to Temuco, where he is currently. In dialogue with Radio Sago, the Health SEREMI Secretaria Regional Ministerial de Salud; local ministerial unit provincial chief, Teresita Cancino, stated that the young man from the Crucero area worked in the dairy sector. He first went to the Alemana Clinic and later was taken to the San Jose Hospital in Osorno Los Lagos region and then was sent to Araucan\u00eda. Cancino stated that this year 2017, 7 cases of confirmed positive hantavirus infections have been registered in Osorno province; of these, 3 died, while in the Los Lagos region there is a total of 17 confirmed cases of which 6 died. The provincial chief of the health SEREMI called on the community to adopt all the preventive measures, such as immediately going to a health center if presenting with symptoms such as fever, muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain and headache. The specific situation under which the young man acquired his hantavirus infection is not stated. As a dairy farm worker, he no doubt came into contact with areas inhabited by the rodent reservoir of the virus. The numbers of cases of hantavirus infections in the Los Lagos region continue to increase this year (2017). Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, including the Los Lagos region, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and if it does is only with very close physical contact, usually within the family. The commonest source of the infection is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat.

Health officials in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have reported an outbreak of measles.  You can get measles primarily by breathing in airborne particles that contain the virus. Symptoms of measles are rash, high fever, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes.  CDC recommends that travelers to the Democratic Republic of the Congo protect themselves by making sure they are vaccinated against measles. Getting measles vaccine is particularly important for infants 6&ndash;11 months of age (1 dose of measles vaccine) and children 1 year of age or older (2 doses of measles vaccine separated by at least 28 days). Clinicians should keep measles in mind when treating patients with fever and rash, especially if the patient has recently traveled internationally.  What can travelers do to protect themselves?  Get measles vaccine or make sure you have already been vaccinated before you go.  Wash your hands often.  Avoid touching your mouth, nose, and eyes.

According to the Newspaper, AES is an umbrella classification under which comes the diseases Japanese encephalitis (JE), water-borne encephalitis, and scrub typhus, among others. As a Member of Parliament, Adityanath had actively raised the issue. In the last 2 days, 16 new cases of AES and 3 deaths were reported from Baba Raghav Das (BRD) Medical College, the largest in the district. However, the hospital and district health officials are claiming that the situation is much better than in the previous years.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. As with cases of encephalitis in Uttar Pradesh and other states in northeastern India, not all encephalitis cases are due to JE virus infections and are classified as AES with undetermined etiology. AES is a term used for multiple etiologies or often when no etiology has been determined. The above report does not indicate whether JE vaccination campaigns have been active there this year 2017. Other etiologies for AES, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_), lychee fruit consumption, and agricultural-related toxicants have been proposed. The above report does not indicate what the etiologies of the AES cases might be. Getting to an accurate diagnosis in these cases of AES will require active field surveillance with epidemiological studies supported by timely laboratory testing. - Mod.TY ", "dates": ["Date: Mon 7 Aug 2017", "years this is the 1st report from those locations this year (2017)"], "title": "Japanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (UP)\r\n\t"}, "131": {"sentences": " Magill Partners GeoSentinel Global TravEpiNet Mobile Apps RSS Feeds  Zika Virus in Cura\u00e7ao  Recommend on Facebook  Tweet  Share Compartir  Warning - Level 3, Avoid Nonessential Travel  Alert - Level 2, Practice Enhanced Precautions  Watch - Level 1, Practice Usual Precautions  Language:  Select  Espa&ntilde;ol  What is the current situation?  Zika virus (or Zika) has been reported in Cura&ccedil;ao. Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in Cura&ccedil;aoare infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:  Women who are pregnant:  Do not travel to Cura&ccedil;ao.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to Cura&ccedil;ao or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers considering pregnancy:  Before you or your partner travel, talk to your health care provider about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection.  Wait before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.  If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex &ndash; or do not have sex &ndash; for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex, or do not have sex, for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy  Talk to your health care provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you&rsquo;re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Wait at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  Men are advised to wait longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.gov  Contact CDC  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  1600 Clifton Road  Atlanta ,  GA  30329-4027  USA  800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)  Contact CDC-INFO  TOP", "dates": ["Zika Virus in Cura&#231;ao - Alert - Level 2 Practice Enhanced Precautions - Travel Health Notices | Travelers&#39; Health | CDC", " Page created: February 01 2016", " Page last updated: August 08 2017", " Page last reviewed: August 08 2017", " 30329-4027", " 800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)"], "title": ["Zika Virus in Cura\u00e7ao"]}, "236": {"sentences": "   Wed 19 Jul 2017 Source: FOX13 edited The Shelby County Health Department has confirmed there is a 9th case of Legionnaires' disease from The Guest House at Graceland hotel.

The Shelby County Health Department later confirmed a 4th case linked to The Guest House at Graceland on Fri 1 Jul 2017, a 5th case Thu 6 Jul 2017 and the 6th was announced on Fri 14 Jul 2017. The aquatic facilities at the hotel are located in the 3600 block of Elvis Presley Blvd. The Shelby County Health Department told FOX13, the aquatic facilities have been authorized to reopen. They told FOX13 they conducted a sampling and after remediation they demonstrated no viable _Legionella_ bacteria. Those who visited The Guest House at Graceland between 15 May and 26 Jun 2017 and have experienced symptoms need to contact the Shelby County Health Department Hotline at (901) 222-9299.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. There are now a total of 9 cases of Legionnaires' disease associated with The Guest House at Graceland in Memphis, Tennessee, 4 of which were diagnosed on or after Fri 14 Jul 2017. Legionnaires' disease has an incubation period (the time from exposure to the onset of symptoms) of 2 to 10 days. Those exposed to the source for this outbreak (said to be the hotel's aquatic facility) just before remediation took place could still 1st become symptomatic up to 10 days after successful remediation. The news report above, however, fails to say exactly when remediation took place or when the most recent cases 1st developed symptoms; nevertheless, the news report does suggest that the period of contagion extended from 15 May through 26 Jun 2017, presumably because remediation took place on Tue 27 Jun 2017. Cases that are 1st becoming symptomatic long after Thu 6 Jul 2017 suggests that there may be an ongoing unremediated source, if remediation of the aquatic facility actually took place on Mon 26 Jun 2017. We are also not told if the species and genotypes of _Legionella_ that were isolated from the 9 patients matched isolates from environmental sources. Matching genotypes from patient and environmental isolates will confirm transmission pathways. More information on this outbreak in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

The majority of people who have contracted hepatitis A are homeless and/or illicit drug users, although some cases have been neither. The outbreak is being spread person-to-person and through contact with a fecally contaminated environment. No common sources of food, beverage or drugs have been identified that have contributed to this outbreak, though investigation is ongoing. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that person-to-person transmission through close contact is the primary way people get hepatitis A in the USA. Vaccination efforts are being implemented in targeted locations by county staff and in collaboration with health care partners. Health providers are asked to inform the Epidemiology Program if they have a patient suspected to have the hepatitis A infection, before the patient leaves the emergency department or provider's office.<br><br><strong> San Diego County hepatitis A outbreak cases and deaths as of 22 Aug 2017 -</strong><br> Cases / Deaths / Hospitalizations 352 / 14 (4 per cent) / 264 (70 per cent) The table does not include all reported hepatitis A cases in the county; only those that are local-outbreak-related.

Since many cases of HAV infection are asymptomatic or anicteric (without jaundice), the total number of cases is likely to have been significantly higher. The epicurve published last week (Hepatitis A - USA (20): (CA) fatal http://promedmail.org/post/20170817.5256184) showed that the outbreak is continuing at a relatively stable rate of 15-20 new onset cases/week. The very high hospitalization rate may be related to the homelessness of the cohort but could represent a more virulent strain. HAV infection occurred in some individuals chronically infected with either hepatitis B or C, but it is not clear whether the deaths occurred in those individuals. Homelessness and illicit substance use seem to be relevant risk factors, while MSM men who have sex with men practices are not. It remains unclear how and from what vehicle the virus is spreading. - Mod.LL ", "dates": ["Date: Tue 22 Aug 2017", "352 / 14 (4 per cent) / 264 (70 per cent)", "5 Apr 2017 / 39 / 33 (85) / 1 (3)", "4 May 2017 / 80 / 66 (83) / 3 (4)", "31 May 2017 / 133 / 103 (80) / 3 (2)", "12 Jun 2017 / 160 / 120 (75) / 4 (2", "27 Jun 2017 / 196 / 142 (72) / 4 (2)", "26 Jul 2017 / 275 / 194 (71) / 7 (2", "1 Aug 2017 / 295 / 202 (68) / 10 (3", "8 Aug 2017 / 312 / 215 (69) / 10 (3", "15 Aug 2017 / 333 / 232 (70) / 11 (3", "22 Aug 2017 / 352 / 264 (70) / 14 (4)", "In the past week [week ending 20 Aug 2017] 19 cases have been", "org/post/20170817", "5256184) showed that the outbreak"], "title": "Hepatitis A - USA (22): (CA) fatal "}, "240": {"sentences": "   Wed 19 Jul 2017 Source: Prensa Latina edited A total of 2 new outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease which tends to complicate the infection panorama in the country, were detected in Colombia, according to an information spread here today Wed 19 Jul 2017 by the Agriculture Ministry. One of these points was detected in the San Faustino city council in Cucuta, north of Santander, where a checkpoint of the entity found animals with vesicular diseases, which were transported in a truck for sale. The 2nd case was located in Tibacuy, in the department of Cundinamarca, which would be a consequence of what had already been detected in neighboring Yacopi, according to the Colombian Agricultural and Livestock Institute (ICA). In the latter place were found 18 diseased animals. As a whole, as in the case of San Faustino, with 32 others, the affected animals were sacrificed, noted the agricultural health authorities. In both cases, the ICA initiated the health protocols and immediately applied the quarantine stage in those farms. So far there are 4 places in the national territory where have been located outbreaks of the foot-and-mouth, including the town of Tame, in the northeastern Arauca demarcation, and Yacopi, in Cundinamarca, where this capital is located. With these outbreaks, Colombia lost the certification of FMD free country granted by the World Organization of Animal Health, which status was maintained since 2009, when it managed to completely eradicate the disease.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Tibacuy is in eastern Cundinamarca; see Yacopi is in Boyacva, east of Cundinamaeca, at: Tame, in Arauca, is close to the Venezuelan border; see: Logic and common sense would suggest that these outbreaks are related to the ongoing foot-and-mouth problems in Venezuela. This is a tragic and very expensive setback for Colombia which had worked hard to eradicate FMD from the country. For their sake may the secondaries be few but it will be a while before the full extent of these events is realised. FMD is a very contagious and infectious disease, so it can mobilise a number ways of spreading, including dirty livestock trucks. Fortunately it responds well to vaccination. - Mod.MHJ   .

Travelers considering pregnancy  Talk to your health care provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you&rsquo;re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Wait at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  Men are advised to wait longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.gov  Contact CDC  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  1600 Clifton Road  Atlanta ,  GA  30329-4027  USA  800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)  Contact CDC-INFO  TOP", "dates": [" Page created: December 10 2015", " Page last updated: August 08 2017", " Page last reviewed: August 08 2017", " 30329-4027", " 800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)"], "title": ["Zika Virus in El Salvador "]}, "466": {"sentences": "   Tue 8 Aug 2017 Source: The Independent Barents Observer edited The authorities responded with resolve when a serious outbreak of anthrax shook the far northern Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug province in summer 2016. A mass evacuation of reindeer herders, including children, quickly started from the exposed areas and the country's Ministry of Defence launched a special emergency task force equipped with 30 tons of biologically active agents aimed at decontamination of infected areas. At the same time, a mass vaccination program was launched. That program is continuing this summer 2017. According to regional authorities, the whole regional reindeer population of about 730 000 will be vaccinated in the course of the summer. So far, at least 230 000 animals have got the vaccine, the Yamal-Nenets government informs. The anthrax outbreak zone was in the Yamalsky district, the part of the province that covers all of the Yamal Peninsula. About 70 000 reindeers have since then been vaccinated in the peninsula. A total of 170 specialists divided on 26 vaccination teams are currently engaged in the effort, the regional government says. Also in the neighboring Nenets Autonomous Okrug a comprehensive vaccination program is unfolding. According to regional authorities about 100 000 animals have so far got the vaccine. The region has about 180 000 reindeer. The 2 sparsely populated regions are among Russia's biggest producers of oil and gas and have significant importance for the country's economy. The 2016 anthrax outbreak is believed to have come from an old burial site with reindeer that died of the disease more than 70 years ago. Veterinary authorities fear that more outbreaks will occur as climate change is melting the tundra permafrost bringing more similar burials sites to the open. \"There are thousands of such cattle graves across Russia and many of them are inside the Arctic Circle, says Sergey Netesov, Chief of the bionanotechnology, microbiology, and virology laboratory with Novosibirsk State university told the media. Anthrax infections are lethal unless they are treated with antibiotics. A young boy died and at least 115 people were hospitalized during the 2016 outbreak.

In addition to these 10 cases, 2 previous cases were diagnosed last May 2017. The company stated that \"everything indicates that the infection occurred last April 2017? during the slaughter of sheep from a mutton-producing farm,\" in which sanitary slaughter was carried out in the middle of that month. They stated that there is \"absolute control\" over the source focus of this case. Brucellosis is a livestock disease. Human infection occurs by contact with fluids from an infected animal, in this case sheep. According to Covap, transmission of the disease from person to person does not occur; infection routes are oral, nasal, ocular, and through skin injuries, cuts or wounds. Currently, brucellosis mainly affects people involved in the management of livestock: breeders, veterinarians and slaughter line staff in slaughterhouses. \"Contamination is very rare outside the workplace, and there is no risk in the food chain,\" the company concludes.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Spain is one of 5 EU member states engaged for years in the eradication of _Brucella melitensis_ with EC financial support; the others are Croatia, Greece, Italy, and Portugal. The infection rate in Spain's animals has been consistently decreasing, in tandem with human infection, which has been reported to the OIE since 2005 as follows: 2005 - 328 2006 - 324 2007 - 246 2008 - 160 2009 - 152 2010 - 106 2011 - 100 2013 - 103 2014 - 79 2015 - 54 Spain presented its 2016 _B. melitensis_ situation on 8 Jun 2017 in Brussels, which follows: \"Spanish National Eradication Programme on Sheep and Goat Brucellosis 2016. Results and evolution;\" see at  . The presentation includes a curve demonstrating the evolvement of the disease since 1991 (slide 8). During 2016, 5 of Spain's 17 regions were still infected, led by Andalucia, the region in which the above described event has taken place. The seroprevalence in small ruminants (sheep and goats) was the following (in percentages): Andalucia 0.24, Castilla La Mancha 0.10, Castilla Y Leon 0.04, Cataluna 0.03, Galicia 0.02.(slide 9). The hazardous, infected organs of animals during slaughter are mainly the genitalia, particularly in pregnant animals, and udders in lactating animals. It would be interesting to obtain some information on the age and sex of the slaughtered animals that infected the COVAP's abbatoir personnel, and the exact reason for their sanitary slaughter (serology-based?). Assuming that the patients suffered infection by _B. melitensis_, laboratory confirmation and details on the biovar involved will be helpful.

The outbreak investigation is ongoing. It has been challenging because of the long incubation period of the disease (15 to 50 days) and the difficulty experienced to contact many individuals sickened with the illness who are homeless and/or illicit drug users. To date, no common source of food, beverage, or other cause has been identified; as a result, the source of the outbreak remains undetermined. Vaccination efforts are being implemented in targeted locations by county staff and in collaboration with health care partners. Health providers are asked to inform the Epidemiology Program if they have a patient suspected to have the hepatitis A infection before the patient leaves the emergency department or provider's office. The table below will provide a weekly update of total cases, deaths, and hospitalizations.

Since many cases of HAV infection are asymptomatic or anicteric (without jaundice), the total number of cases is likely to have been significantly higher. It is not clear whether the newer cases are truly new or just newly reported older cases. An epidemiologic curve showing the date of onset of symptoms of cases over time could assist in this regard. Thus, it remains unclear whether the persistent increase is related to slow reporting, increased awareness and testing, secondary cases, or the persistent source or sources in the environment. The very high hospitalization rate may be related to the homelessness of the cohort but could represent a more virulent strain. HAV infection occurred in some individuals chronically infected with either hepatitis B or C, but it is not clear whether the fatalities occurred in those individuals. Homelessness and illicit substance use seem to be relevant risk factors, while MSM practices are not. It remains unclear how and from what vehicle the virus is spreading. - Mod.LL ", "dates": ["Date: Mon 31 Jul 2017", "officials Monday [1 Aug 2017] to urge physicians and health care", "Diego County [now 295 and 10; see below", "Date: Tue 1 Aug 2017", "295 / 10 / 202 (68 per cent)", "5 Apr 2017 / 39 / 33 (85) / 1 (3)", "4 May 2017 / 80 / 66 (83) / 3 (4)", "31 May 2017 / 133 / 103 (80) / 3 (2)", "12 Jun 2017 / 160 / 120 (75) / 4 (2", "27 Jun 2017 / 196 / 142 (72) / 4 (2)", "26 Jul 2017 / 275 / 194 (71) / 7 (2", "1 Aug 2017 / 295 / 202 (68) / 10 (3"], "title": "Hepatitis A - USA (17): (CA) fatal "}, "194": {"sentences": "   Tue 22 Aug 2017 Source: WHO edited Yemen: cholera response.<br><br><strong> Weekly Epidemiological Bulletin: W33 2017 (Aug 14-Aug 20) </strong><br> Country level:  - The cumulative total from 27 Apr 2017 to 20 Aug 2017 is 542 278 cases and 2003 deaths (case fatality rate CFR 0.37 per cent).

Even more troubling, the virus seems to be circulating among displaced populations who frequently uproot and migrate, making it that much harder to contain. Following a recent visit to northeast Nigeria, Dr Philippa Easterbrook, a senior scientist for the WHO's global hepatitis program, spoke to Devex about a recently-developed WHO response plan created to reduce the number of new cases of the virus and provide training to local health workers as a means of improving case management and diagnosis. This water-borne infection was 1st reported in August 2016 in Chad's Samalat region, to the country's southeast. As of July 2017, the country had reported more than 1600 suspected or confirmed cases, and 18 deaths. The virus then surfaced in neighboring Niger in January 2017, in the Diffa region, an area near the Chad and Nigeria borders. Hepatitis E cases here spiked dramatically in mid-April 2017, and decreased before then increasing again. Now approximately 1450 people are suspected to have been infected, more than half of those women, with 38 fatalities. With the frequent movement of internally displaced populations, the infection eventually arrived in Nigeria in May 2017, in Damasak, a town near the Niger border, and has since seen 696 cases total, mostly at the Ngala internally displaced people's camp, near the Cameroon border in Borno state. Currently, all cases of hepatitis E in the Lake Chad region have been among displaced persons and refugees, Easterbrook explained. \"This led us to the working hypothesis that these outbreaks are all linked and related to large population movements,\" she said. Without immediate attention, humanitarians are concerned that the virus could spread even further within impacted countries and even into unaffected areas, such as neighboring Cameroon or the Central African Republic. Even more so, this outbreak is highlighting the unsanitary water conditions affecting those impacted by conflict in the Lake Chad Basin. Hepatitis E is most dangerous in pregnant women, and has an incubation period of 2 to 10 weeks where the infection remains asymptomatic and undetected in most people. Usually symptoms include flu-like symptoms such as: Low-grade fever, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and most notably jaundice. Because the virus carries symptoms also seen in hepatitis A, yellow fever and malaria cases, diagnosing patients and managing cases can be a challenge. Roughly 5 percent of cases develop more serious complications, according to Easterbrook, however the biggest risk is developing acute liver failure, or in pregnant women, post-partum hemorrhaging which can be fatal. The most pressing agenda in the response plan is the improvement of water and sanitation hygiene in the region. As the virus spreads via contaminated water, Easterbrook cited that the improvement of WASH conditions would not only support the reduction in new hepatitis E cases, but could also reduce the prevalence of other infectious diseases, namely hepatitis A, cholera, and typhoid. To date, roughly 200 restrooms and 100 showers have been constructed in Ngala camp. WHO has also worked with local partners to rehabilitate water points and distribute hygiene kits, which include items such as sanitary napkins and water purification tablets, to women and households. However, cultural barriers impede the progress of these initiatives. \"Some people would rather have low-level restroom facilities rather than walk some distance to a more modernized latrine,\" Easterbrook explained.

Influenza viruses that normally circulate in pigs are called variant influenza when the virus is found in people. Variant influenza viruses are different from typical circulating human influenza A viruses. Most cases of variant influenza occur during summer months in people who raise pigs, or who had contact with pigs at agricultural events like fairs. Influenza viruses do not typically move readily between people and pigs, so variant influenza cases are rare. Symptoms of variant influenza are similar to those of seasonal flu and include fever, cough, sore throat, headache, muscle aches and lack of appetite. People seeing a health care provider for a respiratory illness should let their provider know if they have had recent exposure to pigs. Providers should alert the NDDoH if they suspect variant influenza. \"This is the 1st time a North Dakota resident has tested positive for variant influenza,\" said Jill Baber, an epidemiologist with the NDDoH. \"The child visited the North Dakota State Fair in Minot and had direct contact with pigs. The child was hospitalized, but has since been released and is recovering.\" A 2nd case associated with the State Fair, in a non-North Dakota resident has also been identified.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail According to the available data from CDC , most infections with variant viruses have occurred in children (persons 18 or younger) and most cases have reported direct or indirect exposure to swine prior to onset of illness. Limited transmission from close contact with an infected person has been observed in some investigations of human infections with variant viruses, but sustained human-to-human transmission has not been documented. According to the last update on CDC webpage  , there have been 390 total confirmed cases of A/H3N2v to date. On Fri 18 Aug 2017 a variant case in Pennsylvania was reported in FluView. As of this time, that case has been characterized as an influenza A (H3) variant (H3v) virus. Further analysis is being performed at CDC to characterize the neuraminidase protein of this virus. - Mod.UBA   .

State Wildlife Veterinarian Kimberlee Beckmen said her office is getting the word out about tularemia after a recent rash of reports of animals sickened by the disease around Fairbanks and Palmer. \"Just in the last 2 weeks, there's been a very significant increase in the number of reports,\" Beckman said. \"In fact I had 5 reports in just 2 days, earlier this week week of Sun 13 Aug 2017.\" Beckmen advises pet owners to keep a close eye on their animals for any signs of the disease, because it can kill quickly. \"Many people, if their dog is just acting lethargic, maybe has a little fever, they might wait 1-2 days to go in to the veterinarian,\" Beckman said. \"But we want people to know this is really an urgent matter, to get on antibiotics, sooner rather than later.\" Beckman cited the example of 2 household cats in North Pole that died last week week of Sun 6 Aug 2017, soon after their owner noticed one of them was sick. \"The 1st one died and was diagnosed,\" Beckman said. \"And yet, in the same household, the 2nd cat became ill, and wasn't treated in time. So they lost their other cat.\" Bob Gerlach, the State Veterinarian, said pet owners should look for signs that may not be so easy to detect, especially in younger animals. \"Generally, pets can show mild infection and show no signs,\" Gerlach said. \"Or may show some fever, lack of appetite, lethargy and just not feeling good.\" Fish and Game experts say pet owners shouldn't allow cats and dogs to eat hares, voles and other small mammals that could contract tularemia. Pets that show any signs of the disease should be examined and treated as soon as possible, the experts say. Beckmen said cats and dogs usually contract tularemia by eating the flesh of a sickened animal - usually, the snowshoe hare. She said humans, in turn, can come down with the disease through their household pets. She said it doesn't happen often; the most recent reported case in the Interior was 2 years ago, when a North Pole man got sick after skinning an infected hare. \"It can be very, very serious,\" Beckman said. \"I know of one case where a person who got it from taking a hare out of their cat's mouth, and had some serious, permanent heart damage.\" Beckmen said hares, rabbits and other small mammals come into contact with the bacteria that causes tularemia through ticks that latch on to them. She said the growing number of tick species in this part of the subarctic contributes to the increase in reports of animals contracting the disease. In Alaska, hares and other mammals most often are exposed to the bacteria that cause tularemia through the bite of a hare tick. But, Beckmen says in recent years other ticks have been showing up in the Interior that also could transmit the bacteria. (Alaska Department of Fish and Game) \"The hare ticks and vole ticks are normal and we've always had those,\" Beckman said. \"But what's new is that we have dog ticks. And for about the past 10 years probably those were introduced and they've become established.\" Beckmen also said there are a lot more snowshoe hares this year 2017 because the species is nearing the peak of its population cycle. \"There's a very high number of hares, which happens on a 7-to 10-year cycle,\" Beckman said. \"So we expect to see a lot more tularemia during a 'hare high.' \" Gerlach, the state vet, said livestock usually aren't susceptible to tularemia. But he said they can come into contact with the bacteria, especially in the wild, where it can live for long periods in the soil. Byline: Tim Ellis  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail Tularemia results from infection by _Francisella tularensis_ sub sp tularensis_ (Type A) (formerly known as _Pasteurella tularensis_) and is associated with lagomorphs (rabbits and hares) in North America. It is transmitted primarily by ticks and biting flies, and is highly virulent for humans and domestic rabbits. _F. tularensis_ can be transmitted by ingestion, inhalation, arthropod-borne transfer, or direct contact through the skin and mucous membranes. Organisms are found in the blood and tissues of infected animals and can survive for long periods on fomites including food and water. In addition to vector transmission, tularemia may be spread by contact with infected animals or environmental fomites, by inhalation, or by ingestion of the poorly cooked flesh of infected animals, or contaminated water. Tularemia is difficult to prevent since it can be in the environment or be spread by insects. Prevention measures include keeping pets indoors and away from wildlife. Do not feed animals raw meat, especially that from wild animals. Control ticks and biting flies. There are several good products, both oral and topical for controlling ticks and fleas and biting flies. Check with your veterinarian about which product is recommended in your area.

Health officials in France have reported an outbreak of measles.  You can get measles primarily by breathing in airborne particles that contain the virus. Symptoms of measles are rash, high fever, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes.  CDC recommends that travelers to France protect themselves by making sure they are vaccinated against measles. Getting measles vaccine is particularly important for infants 6&ndash;11 months of age (1 dose of measles vaccine) and children 1 year of age or older (2 doses of measles vaccine separated by at least 28 days). Clinicians should keep measles in mind when treating patients with fever and rash, especially if the patient has recently traveled internationally.  What can travelers do to protect themselves?  Get measles vaccine or make sure you have already been vaccinated before you go.  Wash your hands often.  Avoid touching your mouth, nose, and eyes.

According to the media, \"The Philippines will cull 200 000 chickens, quail and ducks after confirming the country's 1st outbreak of bird flu,\" Agriculture Secretary Emmanuel Pinol said on Friday 4 Aug 2017?. The avian flu outbreak was detected in a farm in San Luis municipality in Pampanga province, north of the capital Manila, which later spread to 5 neighbouring farms. There has been no case of human transmission, although health officials are conducting checks on farm workers. \"We have declared a one-km quarantine radius with the epicenter being San Luis. All fowl found within the area will be culled and buried, and the estimated population is 200 000,\" Pinol told reporters at a news conference. The volume of birds to be culled was half of Pinol's initial estimate of 400 000, which he said was based on a preliminary evaluation and was later revised after inspection. The government's report on Friday 4 Aug 2017? to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) described the flu virus in affected birds as an H5 subtype of highly pathogenic (high-path) avian influenza. Initial tests ruled out high-path H5N1 as the virus strain, Dr. Celia Carlos told reporters, and samples will be sent to Australia for further testing. \"The Department of Health is doing surveillance of possible human cases, especially concentrating on people who have been exposed to the affected animals or poultry,\" Carlos said. Culling should be completed within the next 3 days, said Pinol. The virus may have come from migratory birds from China or smuggled ducks, also from China, he said. There were indications as early as April 2017 of bird flu hitting one farm, but the situation worsened in July 2017, with around 37 000 birds dying during the period, Pinol said. The Philippines is the latest country in Asia, Europe and Africa where the bird flu viruses have spread in recent months. Many strains only infect birds, but the H7N9 strain has led to human cases, including fatalities, in China\". See  .

A total of 14 cows have tested positive for _Mycoplasma bovis_, and are the first to have the disease in New Zealand, while a further 150 cows on the property have signs of infection. Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) director of response, Geoff Gwyn, says they don't know how or when the disease entered the country, after confirming it on Sat 22 Jul 2017. Mr. Gwyn said the disease poses no risk to humans or food safety and there is no concern about consuming milk products. MPI is working with the farmer to contain the disease to the affected farm and treat the animals showing symptoms. Mr. Gwyn says legal restrictions are in place to stop any movement of stock from the property. This outbreak impacts national biosecurity for the Kiwis. _Mycoplasma bovis_ is a pathogen causing respiratory disease, otitis media inflammation of the middle ear, arthritis, mastitis infection of the mammary gland and udder tissue, and a variety of other diseases in cattle worldwide. It is increasingly recognized by the veterinary and livestock communities as having an important impact on the health, welfare, and productivity of dairy and beef cattle. _M. bovis_ diseases can be difficult to diagnose and control because of inconsistent disease expression and response to treatments and vaccines, and large gaps in the current understanding of the epidemiology and pathophysiology of these diseases, which tend to become chronic and do not respond well to antibiotic treatments.

As the source of the outbreaks was not identified, there is the potential for a similar outbreak to reoccur. As of 27 Jul 2017, 78 cases had already been reported in the UK in 2017, of which 37 (47%) had travelled to Mexico; 20 were awaiting travel history; 14 had travelled to 9 other overseas destinations, and 7 reported no overseas travel. We describe and discuss actions taken in advance of an anticipated outbreak during the summer of 2017. Conclusion: Based on the previous UK cyclosporiasis outbreaks, we recommend other European countries to (i) assess, and increase if necessary, Cyclospora laboratory testing and reporting capacity; (ii) increase cyclosporiasis risk awareness among travellers to Mexico; (iii) report cyclosporiasis cases early; and (iv) collaborate in outbreak investigations to identify possible sources and to assess the extent of the outbreak.

But the officials say there is no risk to the public because the parasite that triggers the disease is not present in the territory. It is not known when and how the _Anopheles_ mosquitoes entered New Caledonia but they are now established in the area of La Tontouta, north of Noumea. Malaria is found in other parts of Melanesia. Reports say the mosquitoes were found during checks as part of efforts to fight dengue fever. Another mosquito type, the _Aedes aegypti_, has been a major health concern in New Caledonia, having spread dengue and Zika viruses.

In recent years, animal epidemics and regional epidemics have led to significant economic losses. The increasing number of infectious diseases every year and the emergence of new diseases are a challenge for us to improve the prevention and control of the disease and to reduce the risk of structured and preventive measures before the diagnosis of infectious diseases. It impedes barriers to international trade and closes the export of livestock and their raw products and negatively affects the income and livelihoods of herders and the country, aimag provinces and soum districts economies. The final decision on the implementation of Phase 2 of the Mongolian Livestock Early Warning System was approved by the Prime Minister of Mongolia J. Erdenebat at the 21st International Economic Forum held in St. Petersburg, Russia. In June 2017, Minister of Agriculture and Light Industry P. Sergelen and Minister of Agriculture of the Russian Federation A.N. Tkakaev signed an agreement to supply 4 million doses of vaccine to Mongolia. The 1st consignment, including 1 300 700 doses of the A&O vaccine has been received today (31 Jul 2017). Initial vaccination is planned to address sensitive and vulnerable animals in central and eastern regions in suspected and protected areas. In the future, the supply of remaining vaccines to Mongolia will be jointly organized by the Federation of Animal Health Protection and the Implementing Agency of the Veterinary and Breeding Agency of the government.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. The above media report includes pictures of Russian-sourced vaccine vials. The label on the vial, in Russian, provides the following information: FMD vaccine, bivalent, serotypes A and O. Dosage: For large animals (cattle, buffalo, camels, yak, pig) - 2 cc. For sheep, goats - 1 cc. The vial contains 100 doses for (the mentioned) large animals or 200 doses for small ruminants. Mongolia reported to the OIE a new FMD outbreak, on its eastern region, on 13 Feb 2017. According to the report, the outbreak had started on 24 Jan 2017 and was confirmed on 28 Jan 2017, the causative agent being serotype O. One of the control measures undertaken was \"Vaccination in response to the outbreak,\" addressing cattle, sheep and goats. No information on the manufacturer of the vaccine used or on the vaccine strain included in the applied vaccine, became available. This may have been a different manufacturer, namely not the (current) Russian one. Genotyping of the January 2017 strain from Mongolia was carried out at Pirbright (WRLFMD), indicating that the causative agent in 2017 was serotype O, topotype ME-SA, lineage \"PanAsia\" (see, including a dendogram and most closely related prototype sequences, at  ). Clearly, as apparent from the recent media reports, FMD has widely spread in Mongolia, from the east westwards and northwards. The following information on Mongolia's FMD situation was published in page 7 of EUFMD's Global Monthly report for June 2017, available at  : \"FMDV serotypes A and O were detected in 10 of the 16 samples collected between March 2015 and April 2017, of which one was from a sheep and the remaining from cattle. \"Genotyping of the VP1 of the detected viruses identified the following lineages: A/ASIA/SEA-97, and O/SEA/Mya-98, and O/ME-SA/PanAsia. All the genotypes detected in the present batch of samples were already circulating in the country. \"The most recent VMSD tests available were carried out on 2 of the most recently detected genotypes obtaining the following results: 1. For A/ASIA/SEA-97 conducted on field isolates A/MOG/11/2013 and A/MOG/13/2013, good matching results were obtained with vaccine strains A Iran05, A 22IRQ and A TUR/06. 2. For O/SEA/Mya-98 conducted on field isolates O/MOG/2/2015 and O/MOG/5/2015, good matching results were obtained with vaccine strains O 3039 and O/TUR/5/2009 but not for O Manisa.\" Matching trials for the O/ME-SA/PanAsia strain, currently circulating in Mongolia, are urgently needed. It is not clear whether the vaccination applied during the 1st half of 2017 has conferred protection. The last follow-up report (No. 2) on FMD in Mongolia was submitted to the OIE on 27 Apr 2017, when the accumulated number of outbreaks was 16.

The provinces are Abra, Apayao, Benguet, Ifugao, Kalinga, and Mountain Province. The Cordilleras is the foremost producer of major agricultural crops in the country. An estimated total of 33.5 ha about 82.8 acres was surveyed. _Tomato mosaic virus_ is prevalent in Benguet while _Banana bunchy top virus_ had the highest occurrence at locations in Benguet, seconded by Apayao, Kalinga, and Ifugao. 80 per cent of 0.20 ha about 0.5 acres Chinese cabbage in Benguet was infected with _Turnip yellow mosaic virus_. In Mountain Province, of 0.25 ha about 0.6 acres, 15 per cent incidence of _Potato aucuba mosaic virus_ in potatoes was found, whereas, 12 per cent of Benguet's coffee nurseries were infested with yellowing, little leaf and mosaic symptoms. In Benguet, mushroom bacterial blotch caused by _Pseudomonas_ sp., bacterial wilt caused by _Ralstonia solanacearum_ race 1 on seed potatoes, and rose crown gall caused by _Agrobacterium_ sp. were the eminent bacterial diseases. The study documented several fungal diseases: yam anthracnose, chrysanthemum white rust, anthurium leaf spot, strawberry leaf spot and berry rot, coffee leaf spot, and fusarium wilt in banana. Potato late blight and taro leaf blight were also identified. Byline: BSU R4D  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Crop pathogens mentioned above are or are likely to be: _Tomato mosaic virus_ (ToMV; genus _Tobamovirus_) is an economically important disease of glasshouse and field tomatoes. It can affect a wide range of solanaceous hosts and species in several other families, including many crops. _Banana bunchy top virus_ (BBTV; genus _Babuvirus_) causes one of the most serious diseases of banana; transmitted by the banana aphid _Pentalonia nigronervosa_. \"Turnip Yellow Mosaic Virus\"  this may refer to either _Turnip mosaic virus_ (TuMV; genus _Potyvirus_) or _Turnip yellows virus_ (TuYV; genus _Polerovirus_). _Potato aucuba mosaic virus_ (genus _Potexvirus_) affects a range of solanaceous crops. Yellowing, little leaf, and mosaic symptoms on coffee  may be caused by phytoplasmas or viruses. \"Mushroom bacterial blotch by _Pseudomonas_ sp.\"  bacterial blights, wilts and canker diseases due to different species or pathovars of _Pseudomonas_ can affect a range of crops. \"Bacterial wilt caused by _Ralstonia solanacearum_ race 1 on seed potatoes\"  brown rot (also called bacterial wilt) of potato is caused by _R. solanacearum_ race 3 (biovar 2, adapted to cooler temperatures) or race 1 (prevalent in warmer areas). Yam anthracnose is one of the most serious diseases of the crop; caused by the fungus _Colletotrichum gloeosporioides_ (synonym _Glomerella cingulata_). Strawberry leaf spot may be due to a number of fungi, bacteria and viruses. Strawberry berry rot may be caused by a number of different fungi. \"Coffee leaf spot\"  this may refer to the fungus _Phyllosticta coffeicola_. Fusarium wilt in banana or Panama disease is caused by the soil borne fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. _cubense_. Potato late blight is caused by the fungus-like organism _Phytophora infestans_ which can devastate both potato and tomato crops. Taro leaf blight is caused by _Phytophthora colocasiae_.

(Kurdistan Region) edited The Kurdistan region has banned the import of animals and red meat from central and southern Iraq after the detection of bovine tuberculosis in Wasit, southeast of Baghdad. Bovine TB is a contagious disease that can be transmitted to humans via meat or milk from infected cows. It can also spread throughout cattle herds and to other animals. An official from Kurdistan's agriculture ministry said the ban will remain in place until they are confident that the disease has been brought under control by the Iraqi authorities. Authorities in Wasit slaughtered 1000 cows infected with the disease on 17 Jul 2017. Dr. Miqdada Akrayi, the head of the livestock health department at the Kurdish ministry, told Rudaw that they have informed checkpoints and relevant parties that the import of animals and red meat from the centre and south of Iraq is banned, \"unless the disease is treated and the situation comes under control.\" The ban came into effect on 20 Jul 2017. He said that the Iraqi health ministry did not inform them about the disease \"officially, but that we have done our unofficial follow up.\" Animals imported from foreign countries should have a health license from their home authorities, Akrayi said, adding that animals would be kept for 21 days to make sure they do not carry any disease, including bovine TB. Akrayi said the cattle disease is non-existent in the Kurdistan region, where they carry out continuous check-ups to prevent the spread of such diseases. Dr. Khalid Ajyawi, a member of the Wasit Provincial Council said on 19 Jul 2017 that they will continue to check farms to detect any remaining infected cows in the province. He had said earlier that the affected cattle were slaughtered. Ajyawi added that local authorities will help the infected farm get back to business, as it provides 80 jobs in the province. He added that the field no longer poses a health risk to the people or the livestock. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), TB is a public health priority in Iraq. It is among 7 countries in the region that has a high TB burden, accounting for 3 percent of the cases. There are an estimated 20 000 TB patients in Iraq, according to the WHO, killing more than 4000 people annually.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. The slaughter of 1000 TB-infected cattle on a single day (17 Jul 2017) in Wasit may sound exceptional, but a visit to Iraq's semi-annual reports to the OIE on the WAHIS interface provides supporting evidence on the Iraqi bovine tuberculosis situation as presented in the Kurdish source; however, the slaughter date may have been inaccurate. The WAHIS site \"Detailed country's disease incidence,\" addressing bovine tuberculosis in Iraq since January 2016, presents the following data: Date / location / susceptible animals / cases / deaths / killed & disposed of October 2016 / Wasit / 18 / 6 / 6 / 0 November 2016 / Wasit / 2250 / 32 / 0 / 0 January 2017 / Wasit / 1931 / 725 / 0 / 725 March 2017 / Wasit / 1296 / 414 / 0 / 414 Details on the bTB event(s) in Wasit will be appreciated.

Man\u00aditoba Agriculture's Holly Derksen said, \"I think this is probably the most severe that I've seen it.\" It is unclear if there are other, unreported, cases. The virus also may take root in its namesake barley or other cereals like wheat. \"It does seem like this year 2017 there are some bigger patches and when it is a severely infected plant you will not have seed production,\" she said. \"It really depends on the incidence in the field, but if there are big patches that are affected, there could be some significant yield loss.\" Byline: Alexis Stockford  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail Barley yellow dwarf (BYD) disease occurs worldwide and affects a wide range of grass species (Gramineae) including cereal crops like barley, wheat, oats, rice, maize, and rye. It is the most destructive of the virus diseases for wheat. Grain yields may be reduced by 1/3. Symptoms include leaf discolouration from yellow to purple (depending on the host species), stunting, reduced tillering, and empty seed heads. Plants infected in autumn may not survive the winter or show severe symptoms when growth resumes. Diseased plants often occur in circular patches within a field, which are associated with colonisation by the aphid vectors. BYD viruses have now been split into several species in the family Luteoviridae (mostly in the genus _Luteovirus_). They are differentiated by their ability to be transmitted by various aphid species (family Aphididae) and their virulence on a selected variety of oats. Some of the viruses are transmitted equally well by several aphids, whereas others can be transmitted by only one or 2 species. The bird cherry(-oat) aphid (_Rhopalosiphum padi_) and grain (wheat) aphid (_Sitobion avenae_) are vectors of the severe _Barley yellow dwarf virus-PAV_ (type member of genus _Luteovirus_). Coinfections of several BYD viruses may occur in one plant, which can result in either more severe (synergistic) or milder (due to cross protection) symptoms, depending on the virus partners. The viruses cannot be transmitted by seed, pollen, or mechanical means and cannot survive in stubble or in the soil. Volunteer cereal plants or grassy weeds may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management includes use of crop cultivars with reduced sensitivity to the viruses and control of the aphid vectors. In Europe, a current outbreak of BYD is also being reported from Ireland (ProMED-mail post http://promedmail.org/post/20170609.5094454). disease cycle) BYD viruses and list of wheat viruses: Virus taxonomy and current species list of luteoviruses via: Information, pictures and taxonomy for Aphididae species: Hutchinsons Crop Consultants: - Mod.DHA ", "dates": ["Date: Tue 15 Aug 2017", "Date: Thu 10 Aug 2017", "org/post/20170609", "5094454)"], "title": "Barley yellow dwarf, cereals - UK, Canada "}, "624": {"sentences": "WHO | Advisory Group on Reform of WHO\u2019s Work in Outbreaks and Emergencies with Health and Humanitarian Consequences  Skip to main content  Access  Home Alt+0  Navigation Alt+1  Content Alt+2  Search  Search the  WHO .int site  Submit  Advanced search  Navigation  Home  Health topics  Data  Media centre  Publications  Countries  Programmes  Governance  About WHO  Language  \u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a  \u4e2d\u6587  English  Fran\u00e7ais  \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439  Espa\u00f1ol  About WHO  Menu  About WHO  Who we are  Constitution  Ethics  People and offices  Regional offices  Frequently asked questions  History of WHO  WHO reform  Multilinguism  Employment  Contact  What we do  WHO brochure  Leadership priorities  Emergency capacity  Where we work  Stories from countries  WHO's work with countries  Country specific information  Governance  World Health Assembly  Executive Board  Director-General  Collaborations and partnerships  Partnerships  Hosted Partnerships  Other Programmes, Facilities and Secretariats hosted by WHO  WHO documentation on partnerships  Non-State actors  Non-State actors in official relations with WHO  Register of non-State actors  Former Standing Committee on Nongovernmental Organizations  Evaluation  About  Priority evaluations  Workplan  Planning, finance and accountability  Accountability  Budget  Financial & programmatic reports  Funding  Procurement  What we buy  How we buy  Qualification and eligibility  Vendor registration and tender alert  WHO reform  Programmes and priority setting  Governance reform  Managerial reform  Emergency capacities  Independent Oversight and Advisory Committee  Advisory Group  Documents on reform  Change@WHO newsletter  Global Service Centre  About  History  Events  Join us  Vacancies  Advisory Group on Reform of WHO\u2019s Work in Outbreaks and Emergencies with Health and Humanitarian Consequences  About the Reform  WHO\u2019s emergency reform aims to strengthen and consolidate the Organization\u2019s capacities to respond and prepare for all manner of crises that impact on people\u2019s health and disrupt the delivery of health care services.

I have a friend currently in isolation receiving IV antibiotics after receiving cortisone injections in both knees and her spine. Only one knee was infected. She observed her doctor administering all injections using individual vials and new syringes. I have been told that this is occurring in other parts of the city, and suspect an emerging outbreak due to errors at the compounding pharmacy. I am unaware of which pharmacy produced the solution.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail Intra-articular injection of drugs for treatment of inflammatory and non-inflammatory joint disease is a common practice and can result in septic arthritis, especially following the intra-articular injection of a corticosteroid. _Staphylococcus aureus_ is a common pathogen in these circumstances. However, corticosteroids are immunosuppressive drugs that could allow organisms that rarely cause infection to become pathogens. The incidence of septic arthritis following intra-articular injection of a corticosteroid is thought to be low, but outbreaks have occurred related to lapses in aseptic technique or injection of contaminated solutions. For example, a large outbreak of fungal infection occurred in 2012 in the U.S. that was due to use of contaminated glucocorticoid medication (preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate) from a single compounding pharmacy; over 750 cases of infection and over 60 deaths were identified in 20 states (1). More than 13 000 persons were exposed, most having been exposed through epidural, spinal, or paraspinal injections of the contaminated medication, but 1648 patients were exposed through peripheral-joint or other injections and of these, 32 had septic fungal arthritis after a peripheral-joint injection. ProMED-mail recently posted a report of an outbreak described in an MMWR report that involved multiple breaks in infection control procedures required to safeguard injection practices (2,3). This outbreak occurred in an office-based outpatient setting where scrutiny may not be as intense as in hospitals (4,5). A 2010 study to identify the current injection practices of clinicians in both the hospital and the non-hospital settings in the U.S. found a small, but disturbing, percentage of health care providers who were not complying with recommended practices (6). 1.

The 1st victim was a 3-year-old boy who died in June 2017. He and the other fatality, a 6-year-old girl, were not related but they lived in the same multi-family dwelling in Hildale, UT. Byline; Bill Marler  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. The case fatality rate for EHEC is usually below 10 percent. There is significant evidence that the administration of most antimicrobial agents early in EHEC disease may increase the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Most fatalities are in individuals who develop central nervous system complications in HUS. Since CS Wong and colleagues reported a relative risk of the development of HUS in _E. coli_ O157 infection of 17.3 (95 percent confidence interval 2.2 to 137) (1), it has generally been thought that antimicrobial agents increase HUS risk. In this study, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and beta-lactam drugs were those most linked to HUS. Whether other antimicrobial agents would likewise be linked to HUS; whether the same effect would occur in adults; whether non-O157 strains would behave similarly; and what the mechanism of the effect is, are not clearly known. Overall, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (also referred to as cotrimoxazole) and fluoroquinolones seemed to be the prime offenders, both not uncommonly used empirically for perceived bacterial enteritis. As discussed in Kimmitt's paper in Emerging Infectious Diseases, the Shiga toxin genes reside on a lambda-like bacteriophage genome integrated into the bacterial chromosome (2). Different EHEC strains contain various numbers of these phages displaying much diversity and some being defective (3). In particular, fluoroquinolones induce high-level expression of previously silent bacteriophage genes with coexpression of the toxin genes. A number of studies have addressed Shiga toxin production and/or release using a variety of antimicrobial agents at subinhibitory and/or suprainhibitory concentrations using a variety of markers for toxin. These include direct immunologic measurement, cytotoxicity assays, and enzyme reporters. It appears that imipenem (4) and rifaximin (5) do not induce toxin production or phage-mediated cell lysis, suggesting that these agents may not increase the risk of HUS and might be useful in management. TJ Ochoa and colleagues found that fluoroquinolones induced Shiga toxin induction much more commonly in O157 than non-O157 strains (5), but Lee and Stein did not (6). References: 1.

Health officials suspect that water contamination in the village could be the reason for the disease. \"We are suspecting that water contamination, particularly in that place, has led to the outbreak of typhoid\", District Medical and Health Officer, TVSN Sastry said. \"We also directed the Panchayat Raj department to make sure proper sanitation and drinking water is provided in these areas to avoid future outbreaks,\" he added. The district health officials have deployed health teams comprising of 5 doctors in those regions to study the problem. Typhoid fever, caused by the bacterium _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi, is a life-threatening bacterial infection. Typhoid fever is still common in the developing world, where it affects about 21 million people annually. Typhoid fever can be successfully treated with appropriate antibacterials, and treated persons usually begin to feel better within 2 to 3 days.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Unlike most salmonellae, _S._ Typhi is not zoonotic, being a pathogen only of humans, and may cause constipation and not diarrhea. As a reminder, the term abdominal typhus is still used in some places to refer to typhoid fever, since typhus (caused by _Rickettsia prowazekii_) and typhoid fever (caused by _Salmonella_ Typhi) present quite similar symptoms, such as the fever pattern, the rash, and the cloudy mental state (also called coma vigil). For travelers to the developing world, especially VFRs (visitors to friends or relatives), there are 2 basic modalities to avoid this infection: - avoidance of risky drinks and foods and - vaccination. CDC summarizes these modalities on its website at  : 1. \"Boil it, cook it, peel it, or forget it\" - if you drink water, buy it bottled or bring it to a rolling boil for 1 minute before you drink it. Bottled carbonated water is safer than uncarbonated water; - ask for drinks without ice unless the ice is made from bottled or boiled water; - avoid popsicles and flavored ices that may have been made with contaminated water; - eat foods that have been thoroughly cooked and that are still hot and steaming; - avoid raw vegetables and fruits that cannot be peeled. Vegetables like lettuce are easily contaminated and are very hard to wash well; - when you eat raw fruit or vegetables that can be peeled, peel them yourself. (Wash your hands with soap first.) Do not eat the peelings; - avoid foods and beverages from street vendors. It is difficult for food to be kept clean on the street, and many travelers get sick from food bought from street vendors. 2. Vaccinations If you are traveling to a country where typhoid is common, you should consider being vaccinated against typhoid. Visit a doctor or travel clinic to discuss your vaccination options. Remember that you will need to complete your vaccination at least 1-2 weeks (dependent upon vaccine type) before you travel so that the vaccine has time to take effect. Typhoid vaccines lose effectiveness after several years; if you were vaccinated in the past, check with your doctor to see if it is time for a booster vaccination. Taking antibiotics will not prevent typhoid fever; they only help treat it. The chart below provides basic information on typhoid vaccines that are available in the USA.

Mr. Seun Ogungbure, who works at a diagnostic center in Surulere that gets patients from LUTH, confirmed to Pulse Nigeria in a private chat that the Accident and Emergency unit of the hospital, as well as a few others, have been shut down due to the incident. \"It's very rare that they would close down the A and E if it wasn't something serious,\" he said. He said after contacting medical staff working at the institution that it was revealed that 2 victims died during the weekend, while a medical officer is critically ill. \"It's not an airborne disease but one that can be passed by physical contact,\" he said. Another doctor that works with the hospital confirmed the story, although he said he's only aware of one casualty. He also said: \"There's a surveillance team at the hospital now to handle any other patients.\" The management of the hospital finally confirmed the story on Tue 8 Aug 2017, as Chief Medical Director Prof. Chris Bode revealed that the 2 victims presented their symptoms too late to do anything to help them. He said: \"Each of these 2 patients presented very late and died in spite of efforts to save them. The 1st was a 32-year old pregnant lady with a bleeding disorder who died after a stillbirth. Post-mortem examination had been conducted before her Lassa fever status was eventually suspected and confirmed. No less than 100 different hospital workers exposed to this index case are currently being monitored.\" He also confirmed that the critically ill staff member of the hospital is a resident doctor from the Department of Anatomic and Molecular Pathology. He contracted the viral hemorrhagic fever after performing autopsies on the dead victims and is currently on admission at the isolation ward of the hospital. Despite confirming that there are currently 2 other suspected cases of the virus, Prof. Bode also pleaded for members of the public not to panic as the state's Ministry of Health and the Federal Ministry of Health are doing their best to contain the situation. He said, \"There are adequate materials for containing the disease while drugs have been made available to treat anyone confirmed with it. The Centre for Disease Control in Nigeria has also been contacted. Two other suspected cases from Lagos state are also currently admitted and quarantined while undergoing confirmatory laboratory tests. \"LUTH has always worked closely with officials of the state Ministry of Health in handling a number of diseases of public concern such as rabies, cholera, Lassa fever and the recent diarrhoea disease at Queen's College,\" he added. The viral hemorrhagic fever is spread by rats and leads to death in extreme cases. Byline: Samson Toromade  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. It is not clear whether all of these cases were exposed in a hospital or health center or in other locations where rodents in the _Mastomys_ genus are present. Apparently, at least the physician was exposed in the hospital. Hospital exposures are unfortunate and preventable if health care workers wear personal protective equipment and practice barrier nursing. Monitoring those who have had contact with the cases and provision of preventive medication are prudent. - Mod.TY   ,  .

Zika virus (or Zika) has been reported in Belize. Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in Belize are infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:  Women who are pregnant:  Do not travel to Belize.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to Belize or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers considering pregnancy:  Before you or your partner travel, talk to your health care provider about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection.  Wait before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.  If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex &ndash; or do not have sex &ndash; for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex, or do not have sex, for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy  Talk to your health care provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you&rsquo;re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Wait at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive.

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome is a swine-only virus that comes in a variety of strains, with clinical signs being dependent on the strain and the age or stage of growth of the pig. Dr. Blaine Tully, the President of the Canadian Association of Swine Veterinarians and a partner with Swine Health Professionals in Steinbach, says that until this past winter 2016-2017, Manitoba has had less pathogenic strains of PRRS that producers and their veterinarians were able to manage fairly well. \"This past winter, and now into the spring and summer 2017, we continue to see farms infected with a strain that causes quite high levels of abortion in breeding herds, high levels of stillborn or mummified fetuses at birth, and then also quite high levels of mortality on suckling piglets and in the post weaning phases of growth, where we would see mortality range from, in some instances, double to quadruple normal farm baseline levels. \"Up into the ranges 40 percent of the piglets go on to die, and that is often leading into wean to finish mortality that is in the same range, 20 to 30 percent or higher. Not only does that have a quite a burden on the farm staff having to go through those health changes, but, economically, farms are really struggling with having a level of production that would still meet their sales targets,\" said Dr. Blaine Tully, Canadian Association of Swine Veterinarians. Dr. Tully said that 12 to 15 farms in southeastern Manitoba, the Interlake, and central Manitoba are infected, and, because many of these farms sell animals to commercial slaughter facilities, the risk of further spread increases.

The Malaysian state of Sarawak has declared parts of three divisions to be &ldquo;rabies infectious areas.&rdquo; Five human rabies cases and almost 800 cases of people being bitten by rabid animals have been reported in Serian, Sri Aman, and Kutching divisions as of July 2017. All five people infected with rabies have died.  Public health officials are responding by treating people bitten by local dogs or cats for rabies exposure and advising the public on how to prevent the spread of the disease.  What is rabies?  Rabies is a deadly disease caused by a virus that is spread in the saliva of infected animals. All mammals can get rabies. People usually get rabies from licks, bites, or scratches from infected dogs or other animals such as bats, foxes, raccoons, and mongooses.  Rabies affects the central nervous system, ultimately causing brain disease and death. Once symptoms of rabies appear, the disease is nearly always fatal, so prevention is especially important.  What can travelers do to prevent rabies?  Get a rabies vaccine before travel, if recommended.  Talk to your doctor about your travel plans. If your activities will bring you into contact with animals such as dogs, cats, bats, or other carnivores, you should consider pre-exposure rabies vaccination, which is a 3-shot series (days 0, 7, and 21 or 28) given before travel.  Even if you get the pre-exposure rabies vaccine, you should still get immediate medical treatment if you are bitten or scratched by an animal during travel.  See Vaccine Information Statement for more information.  Avoid animal bites during travel:  Avoid touching all animals, including wild animals and pets. Pets in other countries, such as Malaysia, may not be vaccinated against rabies.  Supervise children closely, especially around dogs, cats, and wildlife such as monkeys and bats.  If you are traveling with your pet, supervise your pet closely, and do not allow it to play with local animals, including local pets, and especially avoid stray animals.  Avoid bringing animals home to the United States. Dogs and cats may be infected with rabies but not show signs until several days or months later. There are also rules and regulations for bringing animals and animal products into the United States.  For more information, see Be Safe Around Animals .  Consider medical evacuation insurance:  Rabies can be treated with a post-exposure vaccine, but the series of shots must be started as soon as possible after animal exposure. This type of vaccination is not available in all parts of the world, so consider buying medical evacuation insurance.  Medical evacuation insurance may cover the cost to transfer you to the nearest destination where complete care can be obtained. Some policies may cover your eventual return to your home country. For more information, see Insurance .  Act quickly if an animal bites or scratches you.  Wash the wound well with soap and water.  See a healthcare provider right away, even if you don&rsquo;t feel sick or your wound does not look serious. To prevent rabies, you may need to start a series of vaccinations immediately.  To get vaccinated, be prepared to travel back to the United States or to another area. This type of vaccination is not available in all parts of the world, so consider buying insurance that covers the cost of travel to a country that can give you the care you need.  For more information, see Insurance .  For more information about medical care abroad, see Getting Health Care Abroad and a list of Joint Commission International-accredited facilities.  After you return home, tell your healthcare provider or state health department that you were bitten or scratched during travel and about any treatment you received overseas.  If possible, give a copy of your overseas medical record to your US healthcare provider.

The good news is that with increased vaccination, the numbers of Japanese (JE) cases have declined. The not so good news is that the numbers of undiagnosed acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) cases have increased. AES continues to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_), and lychee fruit consumption. Recently, scrub typhus has been implicated in many AES cases. Clearly, prospective studies are needed to define the causes of AES. Until the etiologies are known, prevention and effective treatment will not be possible.

A total of 535 people have been hospitalized with severe acute respiratory infection in 10 out of 15 regions of the country since 21 Jul 2017, according to the Health Department under the Ministry of Health and Sports. The department said in a press release that the outbreak had claimed 23 patients so far, while 204 others were confirmed to have been infected with the H1N1 virus. Than Tun Aung, deputy director general of the Health Department, told Anadolu Agency that the outbreak was just seasonal, and not an unusual event. \"It's rainy season which is flu season for our country,\" he said, however, admitting that the infection rate had been on the rise as the virus spread by air. The World Health Organization is providing technical support to the Myanmar government, consulting with regional experts, and offering assistance to have samples tested abroad, he added.

Laboratory staff detected the virus while performing routine testing of mosquito samples. The sample was collected from a site along Gladding Road on the northern end of western Placer County, in an area surrounded by pasturelands. This is the 1st detection of St Louis encephalitis in mosquitoes in Placer County, and it comes on the heels of a detection in Yuba County earlier this week week of 14 Aug 2017. While SLEV has been found historically in many regions of California, there have been no human cases of SLEV since 1970 in Placer County, and only 4 cases between 1945 and 1969. The reemergence of the virus in this area is a new phenomenon, and public health and vector control officials will be closely monitoring surveillance information. SLEV is transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito. In northern California, the mosquito species that carry SLEV, _Culex pipiens_, and _Culex tarsalis_, are the same mosquitoes that are able to transmit West Nile virus (WNV). Infection with these viruses also share the same symptoms. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), most people infected will not become ill. Initial symptoms of those who become ill include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and tiredness from 5-15 days after being infected. Severe neuroinvasive disease (often involving encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain) occurs more commonly in older adults. In rare cases, long-term disability or death can result. Fortunately, another similarity between the viruses is the work done to prevent their spread. \"We would not have to change our strategy or employ new tools to control the St Louis encephalitis virus\" says Joel Buettner, District General Manager. \"What we do for West Nile virus  from the surveillance methods and tools to the treatments we conduct  will help control St Louis encephalitis virus as well.\" Due to this latest development, the District is planning to set additional traps and conduct intensive larval surveillance in the area. The Placer Mosquito and Vector Control District advises the public to implement the 3 Ds of protection: - Drain or dump any standing water that may produce mosquitoes. - Defend yourself and your home by using a CDC-recommended insect repellent and dressing protectively when outside, and making sure screens on doors and windows are in good condition. - Contact the District for any additional help controlling mosquitoes around your home.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail St Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus appears sporadically in California, and has been reported in 4 locations in the state this year (2017). Earlier this month (August 2017) the virus was found in mosquitoes in 2 other counties in California  Yuba and Stanislaus counties. Fortunately, no human cases have been reported there so far this summer. SLE virus is endemic in the south western USA and sporadic cases in humans occur there infrequently. In 2015, human cases occurred in the adjoining states of Nevada and Arizona and positive mosquitoes were found in California. SLE virus was found in mosquitoes in Nevada in 2005. Wild birds are the reservoir host and mosquitoes in the genus _Culex_ are vectors that transmit SLE virus. The mosquito species in which SLEV was detected are not mentioned in the reports above. Avoidance of mosquito bites and elimination of mosquito breeding sites in this area is good advice that should be heeded by the local residents. - Mod.TY ", "dates": ["Date: Wed 16 Aug 2017 2:05 PM

According to Dr Marshall Kohr the horse presented wobbly and unsteady on his feet. Even though about 33 percent of the horses who exhibit signs of West Nile virus will succumb to the disease, Dr Kohr reports that \"this horse is improving and expected to make a full recovery.\" West Nile virus in horses is easily prevented with a safe and effective vaccine. Horses, humans and some species of birds are the most susceptible to West Nile Virus, but dogs and cats can become infected. Dr Kohr was quick to add that \"even though they can get infected it is highly unlikely that dogs or cats would become ill. \"The Veterinarians at the Animal Medical Center recommend that horses in Campbell County get vaccinated against West Nile Virus every year.\" Even though the same mosquitos that infect our horses with the virus can also infect humans, \"there is no risk that a human can contract West Nile Virus from their horse\" Kohr was quick to point out.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Gillette is in north east Wyoming; see  . There is a small inset showing where Wyoming is for those that are uncertain. There is a vaccine for horses though it is not cheap. Horse owners should also consult their private practicing veterinarian to determine an appropriate disease prevention plan for their horses. Vaccines have proven to be a very effective prevention tool. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3-to 6-week period. WNV vaccine is effective and usually combined with EEE (eastern equine encephalitis), WEE (western equine encephalitis), and tetanus. When it is made this easy it is baffling as to why owners have not vaccinated, preferentially in the Spring. - Mod.MHJ   .

The fever has caused the death of 5 people in Iran since the beginning of the current Iranian fiscal year Tue 21 Mar 2017, Amiri said, Mehr news agency reported Wed 19 Jul 2017. No Crimean-Congo\u200e fever case has reported so far in the capital city of Tehran, he added. The cases have been reported mainly in eastern border provinces, where livestock is illegally smuggled into the country. Since 2000, at least 988 cases of Crimean-Congo fever have been reported in Iran, according to the Iranian officials. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a widespread tick-borne viral disease that is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and Asia. The virus is a member of the Bunyaviridae family of RNA viruses. It is a disease carried by several domestic and wild animals. While clinical disease is rare in infected animals, it is severe in infected humans, with a mortality rate of 10 to 40 percent. Byline Fatih Karimov  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. The report attributes CCHF cases to illegal livestock trade in to the country. However, the presence of the CCHF virus has been demonstrated in ticks in Iran as early as 1978, when the CCHFV was isolated for the 1st time from the Ornithodoros tick _Alveonasus lahorensis_in the north eastern region of Iran Sureau P, Klein JM, Casals J, Digoutte JOP, Salaun JJ, Piazak N, et al.

Later in 2002 the CCHFV genome was detected in 22.3 percent of ticks collected from Chaharmahal-va-Bakhtiari province, in the southwest of Iran. The control of tick infestation in the endemic regions would be an important public health measure to control the emergence of new cases. - Mod.UBA   .

The yearling Standardbred cross gelding had not been vaccinated against the disease, said Dr Julie McGwin, state equine program veterinarian. \"It's been a very wet summer so far this year 2017, which contributes to a growing mosquito problem,\" she said in a statement. West Nile virus is caused by a virus transmitted by mosquitoes, and may cause encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain, and is fatal to horses in 90 percent of cases, McGwin said. Symptoms in horses include depression, appetite loss, drooping eyelids and lower lip, fever, weakness, twitching, paralysis or lack of coordination, aimless wandering, circling, and blindness. The virus is not contagious between horses, but can be carried by mosquitoes from an avian, or bird, host to horses and humans. The virus does not pass directly between people and horses. Mosquitoes biting warm-blooded animals is the only route of transmission. Horses that have not already been vaccinated this year 2017 for West Nile virus or other mosquito-borne diseases are at greater risk, McGwin said. \"Those horse owners who have vaccinated should check with their veterinarians to see whether a booster is appropriate.\" Byline: Robert Imrie  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Take note: this valued horse got sick, incurred vet bills, and then had to be put down, which makes it all very expensive. It could have been prevented if the horse had been vaccinated in the spring. We report only those cases that get into print, so check with your veterinarian to see if cases have been seen in your area. If so, get your horses booster shots. -Mod. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ ", "dates": ["Date: Mon 24 Jul 2017", "and became the 1st this year [2017] to be euthanized because of the", "24 Jul 2017]"], "title": "West Nile virus - Americas (05): USA (WI) equine\r\n\t"}, "317": {"sentences": " Visit ProMED-mail's web site at .

Piroplasmosis may be difficult to diagnose, as it can cause variable and nonspecific clinical signs. The symptoms of this disease range from acute fever, inappetence and malaise, to anemia and jaundice, sudden death, or chronic weight loss and poor exercise tolerance. Piroplasmosis is a major constraint to the international movement of equines. Equine piroplasmosis results from infection by the protozoa _Babesia caballi_ or _Theileria equi_ (formerly _Babesia equi_). They can infect an animal concurrently. Equine piroplasmosis affects horses, mules, donkeys and zebras. Zebras are an important reservoir for infection in Africa. Some species of _Babesia_ or _Theileria_ can occasionally infect species other than their usual host, including humans. To date, the most important pathogens for humans appear to be the bovine pathogen _B. divergens_ in Europe and the rodent species _B. microti_ in the US. Although _B. caballi_ or _T. equi_ may have been implicated in a few human infections in the past, these organisms do not seem to be important zoonoses. However, human babesiosis is still incompletely understood, and the possibility of infection with these organisms has not been ruled out.\" ( ). - Mod.CRD   .

The sickness is called hemorrhagic disease HD and reaches various levels of severity each year, the agency reported Mon 21 Aug 2017, but a predominant number of cases have been catalogued in East Tennessee and are part of a larger multi-state outbreak involving several nearby states. At least 20 counties in the region have reported HD among deer and the number of cases places it in the above-average category. \"So far the intensity of the outbreak seems to be localized,\" said TWRA Wildlife Health Program leader Roger Applegate. \"We don't anticipate this outbreak to rival that of 2007, but it is still early and we're actively monitoring the situation.\" HD is caused by a virus that is transmitted to deer from biting midges or \"no-seeums\", the agency said. The virus is not transmitted from deer to deer and is usually fatal within 5 to 10 days if the deer is able to survive the fever, respiratory distress and other symptoms.  communicated by: ProMED-mail Hemorrhagic disease (HD), caused by viruses in either the epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) or bluetongue virus (BTV) groups (Reoviridae: Orbivirus), is the most important viral disease affecting white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) in the United States.

A 5 year old girl is in a critical condition and 2 others are severely ill after eating a supermarket potato salad product infected with _Escherichia coli_ O157, Saitama Prefecture said on Mon 21 Aug 2017. The victims all ate potato salad sold at the Shokusaikan Marche Kagohara supermarket in the city of Kumagaya, Saitama prefecture, the prefecture said. In addition to the girl, who remains unconscious, a 4 year old boy and a 60 year old woman have been hospitalized. All 3 are not expected to be discharged soon. According to Saitama prefecture, the supermarket's deli  Derishasu Kagohara  procured the potato salad from a food-processing factory from outside the prefecture, then mixed cut pieces of ham and apples. The Kumagaya Public Health Center has ordered that the deli be closed for 3 days amid an investigation into the food poisoning, including what caused the _E. coli_ infection and the routes through which the salad was distributed. The incident came to light after the prefecture was notified of a boy being admitted to a Gunma prefecture hospital on 14 Aug 2017. The Kumagaya Public Health Center learned that 8 Saitama residents, who all ate the potato salad sold on 7 and 8 Aug 2017, complained of stomach pains. 3 others ranging in age from 7 to 12 were also hospitalized for symptoms such as diarrhea, but have been released from hospitals already. The 5 year old girl who remains in critical condition has been diagnosed with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a condition caused by an abnormal destruction of red blood cells. Fresh Corp, a Gunma-based supermarket and deli store chain, said no other outlets have reported cases of food poisoning. The firm has apologized for the incident on its website.  communicated by: ProMED-mail It is not clear if the individuals who became ill earlier in the month also suffered from enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ infection. Potato salad seems to be the vehicle for transmission of the infection. Since potatoes are served after cooking, the likely source is not the potatoes themselves but rather an ingredient added to the food. Pork products are not common carriers of EHEC but this has been reported (E. coli EHEC - Canada (04): (AB) O157, pork products, recall http://promedmail.org/post/20140909.2759887). Apples can carry EHEC especially if harvested after falling from the tree and outbreaks have occurred from unpasteurized apple juice or cider (E. coli EHEC - USA (19): (CA) O111, unpasteurized apple juice, alert, recall http://promedmail.org/post/20151107.3774944; E. coli, toxigenic, apple cider - USA (Oklahoma) http://promedmail.org/post/19991019.1857). It is also possible that cross contamination during preparation from other foods could have occurred related to poor kitchen hygiene. ProMED-mail would like more information regarding this outbreak. It may be recalled by ProMED-mail readers and evident from the flurry of ProMED-mail postings from Japan in 1996 and 1997 shown below that substantially more cases of this disease occurred in that time frame.

One affected resident said a villager slaughtered a cow on Sat 15 Jul 2017 and sold the meat. Many residents preferred it because it was cheap but they ignored health risks. On Wed 19 Jul 2017, villagers started flooding Muriranjas Hospital, all complaining of severe pain. There were initial fears they were suffering from gastrointestinal anthrax. Kairo Kimende, who is in charge of the facility, said though the patients exhibited symptoms similar to those of anthrax. However, tests revealed they were suffering from severe food poisoning. \"We took samples from the patients that have indicated that they are only suffering from bacterial food poisoning,\" he added. The residents were screened and discharged. Two were admitted to Kiria-Ini Mission Hospital after suffering from severe headache and stomach pains. After having a meal with his family later in the day, one patient reported that he started suffering from diarrhea and stomach ache. \"Most of us who fell sick decided to wait and see if the symptoms would subside, but they kept getting worse,\" he said. His wife and child were also infected. They were treated and discharged. County director of Public Health John Mwaniki said a team of public health officers have been dispatched to the village to establish what happened. He added that only meat inspectors certified by the Public Health department are allowed to inspect meat. Mwaniki cautioned residents against buying meat from uncertified sellers. This is the only way they can avoid risking their lives, he said. Byline: Alice Waithera  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. If the incubation period was less than 6-18 hours, the illness might have been _Clostridium perfringes_ related although the usually diarrheal illness typically resolves within 24 hours. A longer incubation period with a more prolonged illness of 5-7 days and what seems like positive stool bacterial cultures suggests that salmonellosis might be the etiology. ProMED would appreciate more information regarding the outbreak's etiology and the number of affected individuals. Murang'a County ( ) is one of the counties of Kenya's former Central Province.

A local teen is in the hospital battling a flesh-eating bacterium on his hand. So far in 2017, there have been 4 confirmed cases in Mobile County, 2 from the waters near Dauphin Island and the others from consuming raw oysters. It's too soon to know for sure whether this teen's case is actually _Vibrio vulnificus_, but both he and his mom tell FOX10 News that all the red flags are there. \"I don't want to be in here, but I have to,\" said the 16-year-old in a phone video chat from his hospital bed at USA Children's and Women's. He has been up all night taking anti-bacterials every few hours for 2 lesions on his hand. \"They started him on the IV anti-bacterials right away. They did lots of blood work,\" said the teen's mother. \"They said it takes a week or so to get an actual positive test back, but they are treating it as though it is a flesh-eating bacteria.\" The teenager says it started with a small cut on his finger from football practice, a cut that was almost healed until he went swimming off Dauphin Island on Fri 14 Jul 2017. He said his skin surrounding the cut started blistering. \"It was getting better, but when I jumped in the water, it ended up getting worse,\" he said. Health experts say exposing an open wound to salty/brackish water increases the chances of contracting _Vibrio vulnificus_, a \"flesh-eating\" bacterium that lives in the warm Gulf water. If not treated fast enough, the bacteria can have devastating effects. After hearing about the at least 4 other cases in Mobile County, the boy's parents weren't taking any chances. They rushed him to the ER at Mobile Infirmary. \"They the doctors are looking for signs of healing and no more spreading,\" said the mother. A spokesperson with the Mobile County Health Department also couldn't confirm yet whether this case is due to _V. vulnificus_, but he says the department will start looking into it.

The following is extracted from the \"Bad Bug Book,\" Center for Safety and Applied Nutrition, US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) at  : \"_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in salt water, and acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not imply that the water is contaminated by sewage. Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc., followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis. The \"primary septicemia\" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 percent). Over 70 percent of infected individuals have distinctive bullous skin lesions (shown at  ).\" There are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination) and that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just get gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ can involve more northern geographical areas if the area is affected by a substantial heat wave. - Mod.LL   .

The amount of damage is already amounting to \"many millions of euros\" while parliamentarians and farmers blame the Dutch food safety authority for its handling in the case. The Dutch food and product safety board (NVWA) revealed the scandal and raised the alarm this week about eggs that have been contaminated and pose a severe threat to consumers. It stressed that the level of fipronil was \"so high that their consumption represents a serious danger to public health\". It also advised buyers of these eggs \"not to eat them and throw them away\". Fipronil is an insecticide used against lice, ticks and fleas. For the World Health Organization (WHO), fipronil is \"moderately toxic\" but in high concentrations, it could have dangerous effects on kidney, liver and thyroid gland function. Manufactured by Germany's BASF among other companies, fipronil is commonly used in veterinary products to get rid of fleas, lice and ticks. But it is banned from being used to treat animals destined for human consumption, such as chickens. Amid fears, the Dutch poultry industry could be facing millions of euros in losses, the country's biggest supermarket chain Albert Heijn said it was pulling 14 types of eggs from its shelves. \"All the eggs of these 14 kinds have been sent back to the depot and destroyed,\" company spokeswoman Els van Dijk told AFP. It was \"an unprecedented\" situation for Albert Heijn, she added, saying instructions of the Dutch food authority (NVWA) were being followed. Damage to Dutch poultry farms is already believed to have run into millions of euros, said Hennie de Haan, president of the National Poultry Owners union. The NVWA was due to publish its findings later on Thu 3 Aug 2017 having closed 180 poultry farms across the Netherlands this week after traces of the insecticide, fipronil, was 1st found in samples taken from eggs, droppings and meat in late July 2017. The European Commission said it had been made aware of the egg issue, and spokeswoman Anna-Kaisa Itkonen told reporters developments were being monitored \"very closely\". \"What I can say is that the farms are identified, the eggs are blocked, the contaminated eggs are traced and withdrawn from the market, and the situation is under control.\" It is believed the substance was introduced to poultry farms by a Dutch business, named Chickfriend, which was called in to treat red lice, a nasty parasite in chickens. It said that it used a pesticide it got from a Belgian supplier and now there is an ongoing investigation about whether the Dutch company was aware of the toxic insecticide. On the other hand, the breeders believe that Chickfriend duped them. German agriculture minister Christian Schmidt called a \"crisis teleconference\" on Thu 3 Aug 2017 with his counterparts in German states where fipronil was also detected in eggs. About one million eggs being transported to Germany were also recalled from the border on Tue 1 Aug 2017 with The Netherlands, the Dutch food authority NVWA added. Belgium's federal food chain security agency (AFSCA) said it too has launched an investigation in cooperation with prosecutors. Tests have found fipronil in some eggs but not in quantities that pose a threat to human health. None of the eggs have made it to Belgian supermarket shelves, the Belgian authority said. It is another blow for Dutch poultry farmers, some of who believe they could now be facing bankruptcy after 190 000 ducks were culled in November 2016 due to a highly infectious strain of bird flu. In the meantime, the NVWA has come under fire for its handling of the situation. Press reports in the Netherlands claim that NVWA initially said there was no danger for the public health, and then it issued warning for specific eggs and ended up suggesting no consumption of eggs until the final test results. Dutch lawmakers asked for a debate on the case. \"Consumers and producers should be able to trust that what the NVWA says and does is correct, \" VVD parliamentarian Helma Lodders told Dutch journal Volkskrant. Hugo Bens from farming organisation LTO Nederland, commented, \"The NVWA is not on top of things ... If they had been quicker to signal that there were problems with Chickfriend, the problem would not have spread as fast as it did.\"  communicated by: ProMED-mail The NVWA, the Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority, has attributed a considerable portion of its website to the fipronil-in-layers issue, including separate Q&A for consumers, for producers, and for blocked farms. In the Q&A for consumers, available at (in Dutch), the following maximum residue levels (MRL) for fipronil are provided: \"The MRL for fipronil, according to EC Regulation No 396/2005, is 0.005 mg/kg for table eggs. Eggs with higher contents are not allowed marketing and should be recalled\". NVWA further states, that \"the maximal daily intake (ADI) of fipronil was, according to EFSA's 2006 requirements, 0.0002 mg/kg bodyweight, which means, for an adult of 60 kg, 0.012 mg fipronil per day and for a child of 15 kg, 0.003 mg fipronil per day\".

Fipronil works by disrupting the normal function of the central nervous system in insects. Fipronil is more toxic to insects than people and pets because it is more likely to bind to insect nerve endings. \"Health effects from a brief exposure to fipronil depend on how someone is exposed to the chemical. Direct, short-term contact with skin can result in slight skin irritation. When individuals have eaten fipronil, reported health effects included sweating, nausea, vomiting, headache, stomach pain, dizziness, weakness, and seizures. Signs and symptoms from a brief exposure to fipronil generally improve and clear up without treatment. \"Once in the body, fipronil is found mainly in the fatty tissue, and breaks down into smaller chemicals called metabolites. Fipronil and its metabolites are then removed from the body mostly through the feces and also in the urine. \"Studies have been done to find out the possible effects from long-term exposure to fipronil. In one study, scientists fed fipronil to rats for a year and found an increase in seizures and death among test animals. Fipronil was also found to decrease thyroid hormone levels among rats. However, most short-term and long-term studies find that fipronil does not affect the endocrine system, the system responsible for regulating hormones in the body. \"In another study, scientists found that long-term exposure to fipronil in the diet can affect the ability of rats to produce offspring. Effects in those rats included: less mating, reduced fertility, smaller litter size, and increased loss of pregnancy. Scientists also found decreased survival and delayed development among offspring.\" The additional information below was extracted from Mohamed F, Senarathna L, Percy A, et al.

A high affinity for insect compared to mammalian GABA receptors results in lower animal toxicity than other insecticides blocking this channel. To date, only 2 accidental cases of fipronil poisoning in humans have been published. \"In all of these cases the individuals were exposed to Fipronil (CAS 120068-37-3, MW 437.16) is a N-phenylpyrazole insecticide with a trifluoromethylsulfonyl moiety. \"Our experience with prospectively observed patients suggests that fipronil poisoning is characterized by vomiting, agitation, and seizures, and normally has a favorable outcome. Management should concentrate on supportive care and early treatment of seizures. \"Fipronil disappears rapidly from the blood over the first 15-20h. Thereafter, total fipronil concentrations plateau'd due to slow elimination of fipronil and metabolism of sulfone. Use of activated charcoal may increase clearance, but there is not enough human data to state that conclusively\". The levels set by the EC Regulation No 396/2005 seems quite low, but it is always appropriate to err on the side of caution. There are currently no reports of human effects from this exposure to the eggs. Although eggs may be consumed in a number of forms, they may also be part of numerous other foods, such as bakery goods, soups, and noodles to mention a few. However because of the other ingredients, this would also serve to dilute the amount of fipronil an individual may received from other food products containing eggs. Finding the source of the fipronil will be important. Hopefully the source can be found and the situation rectified in short order. A safe food supply is imperative, but putting chicken and duck farmers out of business is potentially detrimental to the continued supply of eggs. - Mod.

This raw, unpasteurized milk can carry dangerous bacteria such as _Brucella_, _Listeria_, _Salmonella_, _E. coli_, and _Campylobacter_, which are responsible for causing numerous foodborne illnesses and outbreaks. The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) recommends that people drink and eat only pasteurized dairy products (including soft cheese, ice cream, and yogurt). Pasteurization is the process of heating milk to a high enough temperature for a long enough time to kill dangerous bacteria. This is especially important for people at higher risk for foodborne illness: children younger than 5, pregnant women, adults 65 and older, and people with weakened immune systems. However, healthy people of any age can get very sick or even die if they drink raw milk contaminated with harmful germs.<br><br><strong> Brucellosis </strong><br> Brucellosis is an infectious disease caused by bacteria. It is a reportable condition in Texas. People can get the disease when they are in contact with infected animals or animal products, including raw milk, contaminated with the bacteria. Animals that are most commonly infected include sheep, cattle, goats, and pigs, among others. Initial symptoms can include fever, sweats, malaise, anorexia, headache, pain in muscles, joint, and/or back, and fatigue. Some signs and symptoms may persist for longer periods of time. Others may never go away or reoccur. These can include recurrent fevers, arthritis, swelling of the testicle and scrotum area, inflammation of the heart (endocarditis), neurologic symptoms (in up to 5% of all cases), chronic fatigue, depression, and swelling of the liver and spleen. Brucellosis in pregnancy is associated with risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as premature delivery, miscarriage, and intrauterine infection with fetal death. Neonatal infection may occur through transplacental transmission during a maternal bacteremic phase, from exposure to blood, urine, or vaginal secretions during delivery, or through breastfeeding. Laboratory diagnosis of brucellosis involves testing to look for bacteria in samples of blood, bone marrow, or other body fluids. Treatment consists of combination antibacterial therapy. Depending on the timing of treatment and severity of illness, recovery may take a few weeks to several months. Death from brucellosis is rare, occurring in no more than 2% of all cases.<br><br><strong> Brucellosis Case Investigation </strong><br> In the course of diagnosing the cause of fever, muscle and joint pain, and fatigue in a Texas resident, blood culture results revealed that the patient was infected with _Brucella_. Through investigation by DSHS, the most probable source of the infection was determined to be raw cow's milk, which the person had been consuming. The source of the milk was K-Bar Dairy, a licensed raw milk dairy in Paradise, Texas. DSHS is concerned that other people who consumed raw milk from K-Bar Dairy may also have been exposed to _Brucella_ and became infected. Brucellosis may cause short-term and long-term disease. Without specific testing, this disease may elude correct diagnosis, and without appropriate antibiotic therapy, illness may persist.<br><br><strong> Recommended Action </strong><br> Health care providers should consider brucellosis among differential diagnoses when a patient presents with a clinically-compatible constellation of signs and symptoms. The patient should be asked about risk factors for brucellosis. A key question affecting the level of suspicion of brucellosis in this scenario is the patient's consumption of raw milk or raw milk products from K-Bar Dairy in Paradise Texas in Wise County since 1 Jun 2017. These individuals are considered to be at high risk of contracting brucellosis. Consumers are advised not to consume any raw milk or raw milk products from K-Bar Dairy that are still in their possession and to discard them. At this time, it is uncertain how long _Brucella_ may have been present in the raw milk from this dairy. Testing is ongoing in an attempt to answer that question. If a patient seeks consultation because they consumed raw milk or raw milk products from this dairy between January and June 2017, they should be advised to be watchful for signs of chronic brucellosis and clinically evaluated as appropriate. As a healthcare professional, we ask you to familiarize yourself with brucellosis, since it is an uncommon infection and can present with a wide variety of non-specific symptoms and signs that can wax and wane over weeks or even months. For these reasons, brucellosis presents a diagnostic challenge that requires the clinician to become familiar with the risk factors (e.g., potential exposure), signs, symptoms, natural history, available diagnostic tests, and treatment options. CDC has indicated that laboratory testing for this strain of _Brucella_ relies upon polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to establish timely presumptive results and recovery via blood culture for _Brucella_ species confirmation. The strain of _Brucella_ recovered from the index patient in this case is resistant to rifampin and penicillin. The CDC is one reliable source for current information on _Brucella_: . DSHS may issue additional alerts to aid the public and healthcare professionals as circumstances warrant.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail Brucellosis is a disease that is thought exist since ancient times, as it was 1st described more than 2000 years ago by the Romans and Hippocrates. It was not until 1887 that a British physician, Dr David Bruce, isolated the organism that causes brucellosis from several deceased patients from the island of Malta. This disease has had several names throughout its history, including Mediterranean fever, Malta fever, Crimean fever, Bang's disease, and undulant fever (because of the relapsing nature of the fever associated with the disease). See: . The symptoms and signs of brucellosis may develop from days to months after the initial exposure to the organism. While some individuals may develop mild symptoms, others may go on to develop long-term chronic symptoms. The signs and symptoms of brucellosis are extensive, and they can be similar to many other febrile illnesses, so recognition of potential exposure from ingestion of unpasteurized milk or cheese, working in a slaughterhouse or meat processing plant, or working in a microbiology lab is critical information when evaluating a case. In Unpasteurized Dairy - USA: Infection Risk, 2009-2014.

Alemka Markoti\u0107b. HFRS and hantaviruses in the Balkans/South-East Europe. Highlights - The article represents a comprehensive review on HFRS hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in the Balkans with description of epidemic outbreaks in the last 50 years. - The incidence of Balkan HFRS is modest with hundreds of cases reported yearly. - Diverse rodent and insectivore species harbor several pathogenic and non-pathogenic hantaviruses, but only Dobrava and Puumala viruses are associated with disease in humans. - The clinical picture of the disease ranges from mild to a severe form with an overall mortality rate of 9.8 per cent among DOBV-infected patients. Abstract Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome is endemic in the Balkans with epidemic outbreaks and sporadic cases that have been recorded yearly since the disease was 1st recognized. The incidence of Balkan HFRS is modest, with approximately 100 cases reported in most years. Seroepidemiological investigations conducted in several Balkan countries revealed an overall seroprevalence of 6 per cent in Bosnia and Herzegovina, 1.6 per cent in Croatia, 4 per cent in Greece and 1.7 per cent in Slovenia, respectively. The complex ecology of the Balkan Peninsula supports the existence of diverse rodent and insectivore species which harbor several pathogenic and non-pathogenic hantaviruses. Among them only Dobrava (DOBV) and Puumala (PUUV) viruses are associated with disease in humans. Comprehensive clinical studies compared clinical signs and symptoms between patients infected with either virus. A spectrum of clinical picture of the disease ranges from mild illness typical of PUUV infections to a severe form with fulminant hemorrhagic fever and an overall mortality rate of 9.8 per cent among DOBV infected patients. While severe DOBV cases are recognized from Slovenia in the North to Greece in the South, PUUV infections are more frequent in northern part of the area. Balkans represent an area with a potential need for hantavirus vaccines, but due to co-existence of DOBV and PUUV causing HFRS in the same region, a universal vaccine is required. 3. Epidemiology 3.1. ... Macedonia. The 1st report of an HFRS case in the Republic of Macedonia dates to 1987. In a 3-year period, from 1987 to 1990, at least 10 DOBV cases were diagnosed, with a 10 per cent mortality rate See Polenakovic, et al, 1995, referenced in the full article available at the above URL.  communicated by: Jas' Mantero When the above report was submitted by Jas' Mantero, he commented that occurrence of hantavirus infections is not totally unexpected in Macedonia, as in other countries in the Balkans. There have been important outbreaks in the past, especially in the 1980-1990s. These are the 1st reports of hantavirus infections in Macedonia that ProMED-mail has posted.

Freshtex Produce LLC of Alamo, TX, posted its recall of \"Valery\" brand maradol papayas from the farm in Southern Mexico on Mon 7 Aug 2017. Freshtex Produce distributed the recalled papayas to customers in Illinois from 10 through 13 Jul 2017. \"However, the product may have been further distributed outside the state of Illinois,\" according to the recall notice on the Food and Drug Administration's website. Grande Produce of San Juan, TX, and Agroson's Produce of New York City already recalled whole, fresh maradol papayas from the Carica de Campeche farm in Southern Mexico. Although no illnesses had been confirmed in relation to the Valery brand of maradol papayas as of Mon 7 Aug 2017, there are 109 people across 16 states who have been confirmed with salmonellosis infections, according to a Mon 7 Aug 2017 update from the CDC. Among the 76 outbreak victims for whom information is available, there is a 46 percent hospitalization rate, with 35 victims having experienced symptoms so severe they had to be admitted. One person in New York City died. Additional victims are expected to be identified because people who became ill after Mon 10 Jul 2017 might not yet be included in the CDC's numbers because of the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks, according to the CDC. The CDC is recommending that consumers should not eat  and restaurants and retailers should not sell  maradol papayas from any suppliers in Mexico until further notice. The FDA was more specific in its outbreak update on Mon 7 Aug 2017 evening. \"The FDA is now advising that consumers avoid Caribena, Cavi and Valery brands of maradol papayas, and all varieties of papayas from the Carica de Campeche farm located in Campeche, Mexico, as a result of the FDA's traceback investigation and testing,\" according to the agency's outbreak update. \"The FDA is working to identify additional brand(s) that these papayas are sold under and facilitate recall(s). Meanwhile, consumers should ask their retailers about the source of their papayas.\" The fresh papayas recalled by Freshtex Produce can be identified by the Valery name on the box and labels that say grown and packed by Carica de Campeche. Freshtex Produce has ceased importing papayas from the grower, \"and is taking all precautionary measures to ensure the safety of its imported produce,\" according to the recall notice. The FDA has been working with state officials and the CDC to investigate the ongoing outbreak, which was 1st identified by Maryland public health staff investigating a cluster of _S._ Kiambu illnesses. Grande Produce of San Juan, TX, recalled Caribena brand maradol papayas it distributed in Maryland and other states after people confirmed with salmonellosis reported eating the fruit before they became ill. Lab tests conducted by Maryland officials confirmed the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ on Caribena brand maradol papayas collected from a grocery store in Baltimore and from sick people's homes. Fri 4 Aug 2017 morning, FDA named the Carica de Campeche farm in Mexico as the source of several brands of papayas, including those distributed by Grande Produce and Agroson's that tested positive for Salmonella. \"Papayas from the Carica de Campeche farm tested positive for _Salmonella_ Kiambu, _Salmonella_ Thompson, _Salmonella_ Agona, _Salmonella_ Senftenberg, and _Salmonella_ Gaminara,\" FDA reported Fri 4 Aug 2017 morning.

The man, 22, began having symptoms of the disease during the 4th of July weekend, his family told Fox 40. The family wrote on a crowdfunding page that they were camping at Lee Vining when he began having consistent headaches over 5 days. One day, he woke up with a 104 F 40 C fever. \"My mom and I insisted he return to Sacramento with us, not knowing how fast this was going to progress,\" the man's brother wrote. \"After a couple hours in the ER, vomiting began, and his lungs began to fill with fluid. He was quickly rushed to the ICU where he has now been for 9 days,\" he added. The man remains in critical condition as he continues to battle the rare virus that is usually spread through deer mice droppings. The 22-year-old worked as a tour guide at Bodie State Park in California, a ghost town about 100 miles from Yosemite National Park. The Department of Parks and Recreations has not confirmed that he contracted the disease during his stay at the state park, but his family said the guides knew there were deer mice in the cabins. California Department of Public Health reported that one person died in 2011 after contracting the disease during his visit to Bodie State Park. The family wrote an updated statement on Monday 17 Jul 2017 that the man is \"awake and able to communicate\" by writing on a whiteboard. He was breathing through a ventilator on Sunday 16 Jul 2017 due to fluid in his lungs. Since 2012, at least 10 people have contracted the virus after visiting Yosemite National park, Fox 40 reported. The virus kills more than one third of its victims but cannot be transmitted from person to person.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. The hantavirus involved in this, and doubtless earlier cases in the western USA, is Sin Nombre virus. Fatalities are due to hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS). HPS can be very serious, and patients developing the symptoms should seek medical attention at the earliest possible time. It appears that the case above was HPS, but he will probably survive it. Infected rodents shed the virus in feces, urine and saliva. Individuals opening up cabins or storage areas that have been closed over winter or cleaning areas with signs of rodent presence should heed the precautions that the CDC recommends in order to avoid exposure to the virus ( ).

Jain  Los ni\u00f1os migrantes no reciben vacunas  \u201cCon frecuencia, los ni\u00f1os de los trabajadores migrantes no se benefician de la inmunizaci\u00f3n sistem\u00e1tica y complementaria\u201d, dice la Dra. Nata Menabde, Representante de la OMS en la India. \u201cNo est\u00e1n tan bien vacunados como los ni\u00f1os que viven permanentemente en un lugar, de modo que debilitan la inmunizaci\u00f3n de la poblaci\u00f3n cuando se trasladan a zonas de alto riesgo.\u201d  La inmunizaci\u00f3n de la poblaci\u00f3n y la inmunizaci\u00f3n \u201ccolectiva\u201d se producen cuando una proporci\u00f3n suficiente de la poblaci\u00f3n est\u00e1 inmunizada contra determinada enfermedad infecciosa. En el caso de la poliomielitis, la inmunizaci\u00f3n se adquiere mediante vacunaci\u00f3n.  Aunque la India avanza hacia la eliminaci\u00f3n de la poliomielitis, algunos casos siguen detect\u00e1ndose entre comunidades migrantes en Estados que, de otro modo, estar\u00edan exentos de poliomielitis. La secuenciaci\u00f3n gen\u00e9tica del virus revel\u00f3 que las poblaciones migrantes estaban manteniendo la transmisi\u00f3n y transmitiendo el virus de la poliomielitis en esas zonas, lo que pon\u00eda en peligro los esfuerzos de erradicaci\u00f3n.  Con el apoyo de la OMS, el Proyecto nacional de vigilancia de la poliomielitis de la India, establecido por el Gobierno de la India, puso en marcha una estrategia para llegar mejor a esas poblaciones migrantes.  \u201cAlgunos de los ni\u00f1os nunca hab\u00edan recibido ninguna vacuna en su vida.\u201d  Dr. Sachin Rewaria, Coordinador de Capacitaci\u00f3n de la Oficina de la OMS en la India  Personal sanitario identifica asentamientos de migrantes  El primer reto consisti\u00f3 en identificar a las personas a las que se deb\u00eda llegar. La Oficina de la OMS en la India colabor\u00f3 estrechamente con las autoridades sanitarias en la elaboraci\u00f3n de un plan destinado a localizar poblaciones migrantes e incorporarlas a las campa\u00f1as de inmunizaci\u00f3n.  Cada centro de atenci\u00f3n primaria de salud se encarg\u00f3 de identificar y localizar asentamientos migrantes/provisionales en sus respectivas zonas. Los m\u00e9dicos recabaron la ayuda de enfermeras-parteras auxiliares, agentes de salud comunitarios, activistas de salud social y agentes vacunadores para que recorrieran sus zonas e identificaran y localizaran n\u00facleos de poblaciones de migrantes y estimaran el n\u00famero de familias. Esa informaci\u00f3n se utiliz\u00f3 posteriormente para planificar campa\u00f1as de vacunaci\u00f3n contra la poliomielitis.  La estrategia permiti\u00f3 identificar m\u00e1s de 400 000 asentamientos de alto riesgo, incluidos tugurios de zonas urbanas y asentamientos de migrantes en obras en construcci\u00f3n y en torno a hornos de ladrillos, as\u00ed como otros asentamientos de n\u00f3mades, tales como las aldeas de pescadores migrantes.  \u201cEstas son algunas de las personas m\u00e1s desatendidas y marginadas de la India,\u201d dice el Dr. Sachin Rewaria, Coordinador de Capacitaci\u00f3n en la Oficina de la OMS en la India. \u201cSus condiciones de vida los exponen a numerosos riesgos para la salud, pero no aparecen en el radar de ning\u00fan servicio de salud. Algunos de los ni\u00f1os jam\u00e1s han recibido ninguna vacuna en su vida.\u201d  Ense\u00f1anzas extra\u00eddas de las campa\u00f1as de vacunaci\u00f3n contra la poliomielitis  La cartograf\u00eda intensiva sent\u00f3 las bases para las campa\u00f1as de vacunaci\u00f3n espec\u00edfica contra la poliomielitis en los pr\u00f3ximos a\u00f1os. Se desplegaron equipos de vacunaci\u00f3n para visitar entre 125 y 150 hogares por d\u00eda en esos asentamientos. Dado que los ni\u00f1os suelen acompa\u00f1ar a sus padres en el trabajo, los agentes vacunadores tuvieron que ir a los asentamientos muy temprano por la ma\u00f1ana, o por la noche, cuando era m\u00e1s probable que los ni\u00f1os estuvieran en las cercan\u00edas.  OMS/Salud. Jain  \u201cAhora que la India est\u00e1 exenta de poliomielitis, estamos aprovechando las ense\u00f1anzas adquiridas en esa esfera para asegurar que tambi\u00e9n estos ni\u00f1os reciban inmunizaci\u00f3n sistem\u00e1tica,\u201d dice el Dr. Rakesh Kumar, Subsecretario, Ministerio de Salud y Bienestar Social, Gobierno de la India.  En el 2013, el Gobierno organiz\u00f3 cuatro semanas de inmunizaci\u00f3n especial en el pa\u00eds, con el fin de proporcionar inmunizaci\u00f3n sistem\u00e1tica a comunidades migrantes identificadas.  Los planes de inmunizaci\u00f3n sistem\u00e1tica incluyen ahora esos lugares de alto riesgo, y se organizan frecuentes actividades de inmunizaci\u00f3n sistem\u00e1tica, habida cuenta de la elevada rotaci\u00f3n de las familias.  \u201cEl legado de la campa\u00f1a de erradicaci\u00f3n de la poliomielitis es que la India cuenta ahora con los conocimientos especializados y las aptitudes operacionales para llegar a cada ni\u00f1o con las intervenciones sanitarias esenciales, independientemente de cuan marginado y aislado se encuentre el ni\u00f1o\u201d, dice el Dr. Menabde.

Zika virus (or Zika) has been reported in the US Virgin Islands. Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in the US Virgin Islands are infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:  Women who are pregnant:  Do not travel to the US Virgin Islands.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to the US Virgin Islands or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers considering pregnancy:  Before you or your partner travel, talk to your health care provider about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection.  Wait before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.  If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex &ndash; or do not have sex &ndash; for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex, or do not have sex, for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy  Talk to your health care provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you&rsquo;re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Wait at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  Men are advised to wait longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.gov  Contact CDC  Centers for Disease Control and

Times edited 5 Korean students who visited India have been stricken with typhoid fever. The students are from Sangmyung University's Cheonan Campus in South Chungcheong Province, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Mon 21 Aug 2017. They had visited India's northern region, including the cities of Agra and New Delhi, with 18 other students and 2 instructors as part of the school's overseas education program from 19 to 27 Jul 2017. After they returned, 7 sought medical attention for fever, chills, and diarrhea. 4 were diagnosed with typhoid. In a follow-up check, another student was diagnosed with the disease. 4 of the 5 students remain in a hospital. One student was released on Fri 18 Aug 2017. Of 225 Koreans who caught typhoid fever abroad between 2011-2016, 23 per cent had visited India. The health authority has advised that people planning to visit India should be vaccinated against the waterborne disease, which is also infectious through food. Health officials also said that people who experience fever, chills, and diarrhea within 60 days  the disease's maximum latency period  after returning from India must report to a hospital to be checked for the disease. byline: Ko Dong-hwan  communicated by: ProMED-mail Typhoid fever, so-called enteric fever caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi, often has a totally different presentation from that of the commoner kinds of salmonellosis. Epidemiologically, usually spread by contaminated food or water, typhoid is not a zoonosis like the commoner types of salmonellosis. Clinically, vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent; indeed, constipation is frequently reported. As it is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive. The symptoms of classical typhoid fever typically include fever, anorexia, lethargy, malaise, dull continuous headache, non-productive cough, vague abdominal pain, and constipation. Despite the often high fever, the pulse is often only slightly elevated. During the 2nd week of the illness, there is protracted fever and mental dullness, classically called coma vigil. Diarrhea may develop but usually does not. Many patients develop hepatosplenomegaly both liver and spleen enlarged. After the 1st week or so, many cases develop a maculopapular rash on the upper abdomen. These lesions (\"rose spots\") are about 2 cm 0.78 in in diameter and blanch on pressure. They persist for 2-4 days and may come and go. Mild and atypical infections are common. The word typhoid (as in typhus-like) reflects the similarity of the louseborne rickettsial disease epidemic typhus and that of typhoid fever; in fact, in some areas, typhoid fever is still referred to as abdominal typhus.

Public Health Gibraltar and the Environmental Agency confirmed that the mosquito of the species _Aedes albopictus_, also known as the tiger mosquito, has been found in Gibraltar. Last June 2017 after 9 months of intensive surveillance, officials said no tiger mosquito had been found in Gibraltar. But this has now changed after the 1st tiger mosquito was found in the urban domestic environment within Gibraltar. \"This finding alone does not however materially alter any health risks in Gibraltar and there is no immediate cause for public concern,\" the government said in a statement. Public Health Gibraltar was first alerted in January 2016 to the discovery of the mosquito in M\u00e1laga and Algeciras in Andalusia, Spain. Since then, together with the Environmental Agency, it began working with international experts to mount surveillance in Gibraltar. World Health Organization experts visited Gibraltar and gave advice on setting traps and monitoring locations, but no tiger mosquito had been detected until now. The tiger mosquito is not native to Gibraltar and has not been previously found here. It is common in other countries where it transmits viral diseases like Zika, dengue, and chikungunya. It is a domestic species, breeds in water in urban areas  water butts, blocked drains, rainwater gullies  and is able to reach high abundance around residential areas. It is also a day-time mosquito, that aggressively bites humans. \"Health risks to the public only arise if the virus causing these diseases is also present, which is not the case in Gibraltar,\" the government said. \"The virus can, however, be imported by travellers returning from an overseas country and if this happens, there is a risk of spread, but only if the mosquito bites within a small window period of about a week after the fever starts.\" Public Health Gibraltar has been raising awareness of travel risk amongst travellers through its publication A Factsheet for Travellers and recommends the following precautions: - before travelling to affected areas, consult your doctor or seek advice from a travel clinic, especially if you have an immune disorder or severe chronic illness; - if you are pregnant or are considering pregnancy, consider postponing non-essential travel; - when staying in a mosquito-prone area, wear mosquito repellents and take mosquito bite prevention measures; - if you have symptoms within 3 weeks of return from an affected country, contact your doctor; - if you have been diagnosed with any of the diseases Zika, dengue, or chikungunya, take strict mosquito bite prevention measures for 10 days after the fever starts. Now it has been found in Gibraltar. The concerns are real about transmission of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses should populations of _Ae. albopictus_ become established. In 2015 there were a few locally acquired cases of dengue in the south of France. This also happened on a larger scale in Emilia Romagna, Italy, when a viremic man introduced chikungunya virus into Italy and sparked an outbreak.

According to a statement released by Banner Thunderbird Medical Center, infant botulism cases are rare, but potentially life-threatening. The illness affects only one to 2 infants in the county annually. It was one day before the infant's birthday when his parents noticed something was off. He stopped walking, and couldn't hold his head up. \"We knew something was off, maybe he fell, hurt himself,\" said a parent. \"He couldn't hold his head up. He couldn't sit up. He was completely paralyzed.\" Now, the infant is reportedly doing much better. \"He's moving more,\" said Hansberger. \"He's still on the ventilator. We were hoping to get him off, but with the scare yesterday Tue 15 Aug 2017, right now, he is sedated. Spores of _Clostridium botulinum_ are ubiquitous in the environment and many times a specific source is not discovered. It should be noted that even totally breast-fed infants can develop this entity. The following is extracted from the CDC report on infant botulism in New York City (ProMED-mail post Infant botulism - USA (New York City) http://promedmail.org/post/20030117.0144): \"Intestinal botulism is the commonest form of human botulism in the USA; about 100 cases are reported among infants in the USA annually. Intestinal botulism occurs rarely in older children and adults this form has been also referred to as adult colonization botulism. - Mod.LL. Intestinal botulism results from colonization and bacterial production of botulinum toxin in the colon. Swallowing ambient _Clostridium botulinum_ spores, which exist worldwide in soil and dust, has been proposed as the principal route of exposure; honey is an avoidable source of some causative spores. A common source of exposure is not usually identified; apparent clusters are rare and often remain unexplained after investigations are complete. In a cluster of infant botulism cases identified previously in the mid-Atlantic region of the USA, no common source of exposure was identified. \"Botulism should be suspected in previously healthy infants aged less than 12-months-old who are constipated and who exhibit weakness in sucking, swallowing, or crying; hypotonia decreased muscle tone; and progressive bulbar and extremity muscle weakness. About half of patients require mechanical ventilation during hospitalization. Lumbar puncture and brain imaging generally yield normal results but can help differentiate among other causes of flaccid weakness. When infant botulism is suspected, local and state health departments should be notified promptly to arrange diagnostic stool testing.\" Although not specifically stated in this post, botulism immune globulin (BIG-IV) is indicated in infants with clinically diagnosed infant botulism, before diagnostic confirmation. The prompt use of this specific immunoglobulin leads to a significant decrease in both ICU and total hospital stay. Reviews regarding BIG - IV use and infant botulism can be found in the references below.<br><br><strong> References </strong><br> 1.

She also noticed an eschar on the left thigh on the same day. She had returned from Zambia on Wed 9 Aug 2017. The last 7 days before the return flight were spent in the South Luangwa National Park (northern aspect), together with her husband. They went on game tours and described the area as being very wet due to a comparatively heavy rain season. She recalled several bites by tsetse flies during the time spent there. She presented to the Frankfurt University hospital emergency department on 16 Aug 2017 and blood was immediately taken and examined for parasites. Trypanosomes could be seen in a QBC microscopy and a thin film. Treatment with suramin was initiated and the case was brought to the attention of the WHO. The patient is suffering from human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), East African form. Her symptoms consisted of fever, headache, muscle aches and a very notable eschar. The patient had a remarkable pancytopenia initially. According the WHO, 8 cases of HAT were reported in Zambia in 2015 ( ). In 2015, a case of HAT was reported in a Canadian tourist who had also visited South Luangwa National Park ( ). Another 3 cases were described on ProMED-mail in 2010, all of which had visited South Luangwa NP http://promedmail.org/post/20101111.4093, http://promedmail.org/post/20101022.3833, and http://promedmail.org/post/20100915.3338 HAT is repeatedly affecting travelers to the African subcontinent, when they are exposed to tsetse flies.

What is the current situation?  The Brazilian Ministry of Health has reported an ongoing outbreak of yellow fever. The first cases were reported in the State of Minas Gerais in December 2016, but confirmed cases have since been reported in the neighboring states of Espirito Santo, S&atilde;o Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro. Cases have occurred mainly in rural areas, with most cases being reported from Minas Gerais state. Some cases have resulted in death. Health authorities in the affected states, with assistance from the Brazilian Ministry of Health, are conducting mass vaccination campaigns among unvaccinated residents of affected areas.  In response to this outbreak, health authorities have recently expanded the list of areas in which yellow fever vaccination is recommended for travelers. Yellow fever vaccination is now recommended in all of Espirito Santo and Rio de Janeiro states, including the city of Rio de Janeiro; S&atilde;o Paulo state, with the exception of the urban area of the city of S&atilde;o Paulo; and a number of municipalities in the state of Bahia.

It is located at http://portalsaude.saude.gov.br/images/pdf/2015/novembro/19/Lista-de-Municipios-ACRV-Febre-Amarela-Set-2015.pdf .  Note: because yellow fever vaccination was previously recommended and continues to be recommended in western parts of the states of S&atilde;o Paulo and Bahia, some municipalities in each of these states are included on this older list.  Anyone 9 months or older who travels to these areas should be vaccinated against yellow fever. People who have never been vaccinated against yellow fever should not travel to areas with ongoing outbreaks. CDC no longer recommends booster doses of yellow fever vaccine for most travelers. However, a booster dose may be given to travelers who received their last dose of yellow fever vaccine at least 10 years ago and who will be in a higher-risk setting, including areas with ongoing outbreaks. Because of the ongoing outbreak, travelers to the Brazilian states of Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo (except the city of Sao Paulo), and parts of Bahia state, may consider getting a booster if their last yellow fever vaccination was more than 10 years ago. Travelers should consult with a yellow fever vaccine provider to determine if they should be vaccinated. For more information on booster shots, see &ldquo;Clinician Information,&rdquo; below.  Because of a temporary total depletion of YF-Vax , travelers may need to contact a yellow fever vaccine provider well in advance of travel.  What is yellow fever?  Yellow fever is a disease caused by a virus spread by mosquito bites. Symptoms take 3&ndash;6 days to develop and include fever, chills, headache, backache, and muscle aches. About 15% of people who get yellow fever develop serious illness that can lead to bleeding, shock, organ failure, and sometimes death.  How can travelers protect themselves?  Get yellow fever vaccine:  Visit a yellow fever vaccination (travel) clinic and ask for a yellow fever vaccine.  You should receive this vaccine at least 10 days before your trip.  After receiving the vaccine, you will receive a signed and stamped International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (ICVP, sometimes called the &ldquo;yellow card&rdquo;), which you must bring with you on your trip.  For most travelers, one dose of the vaccine lasts for a lifetime. Consult a travel medicine provider to see if additional doses of vaccine may be recommended for you based on specific risk factors.  In rare cases, the yellow fever vaccine can have serious and sometimes fatal side effects. People older than 60 years and people with weakened immune systems might be at higher risk of developing these side effects. Also, there are special concerns for pregnant and nursing women. Talk to your doctor about whether you should get the vaccine.  Prevent mosquito bites:  Cover exposed skin by wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants.  Use an EPA-registered insect repellent containing DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), IR3535, or 2-undecanone (methyl nonyl ketone). Always use as directed.  If you are also using sunscreen, apply sunscreen first and insect repellent second.  Pregnant and breastfeeding women can use all EPA-registered insect repellents, including DEET, according to the product label.  Most repellents, including DEET, can be used on children older than 2 months.  Follow package directions when applying repellent on children . Avoid applying repellent to children&rsquo;s hands, eyes, or mouth.  Use permethrin-treated (clothing and gear (such as boots, pants, socks, and tents). You can buy pre-treated clothing and gear or treat them yourself:  Treated clothing remains protective after multiple washings. See the product information to find out how long the protection will last.  If treating items yourself, follow the product instructions carefully.  Do not use permethrin directly on skin.  Stay and sleep in screened or air conditioned rooms.  Use a bed net if the area where you are sleeping is exposed to the outdoors.

National Lassa Fever Working Group meetings and weekly National Surveillance and Outbreak Response meetings are ongoing at NCDC to keep abreast of the current Lassa fever situation in the country. 1.5.2. Response materials for VHFs prepositioned across the country by NCDC at the beginning of the dry season. 1.5.3. New VHF guidelines have been developed by the NCDC (interim national viral haemorrhagic fevers preparedness guidelines and standard operating procedures for Lassa fever management). 1.5.4. Ongoing reclassification of reported Lassa fever cases. 1.5.5. Ongoing review of the variables for case-based surveillance for VHF. 1.5.6. VHF case-based forms completed by affected states are being entered into the new VHF management system. This system allows for the creation of a VHF database for the country. 1.5.7. NCDC team sent to Edo State to support Lassa fever data harmonization and updating of VHF case-based management database. 1.5.8. Confirmed cases are being treated at identified treatment/isolation centres across the states with Ribavirin and necessary supportive management also instituted. 1.5.9. Onsite support was earlier provided to Ogun, Nasarawa, Taraba, Ondo and Borno States by the NCDC and partners. 1.5.10. Offsite support provided by NCDC/partners in all affected states. 1.5.11.

Once again, ProMED-mail thanks Dr Olutayo Olajide Babalobi for sending in the Epidemiological Report above. As noted in earlier comments, Lassa fever remains a problem in Nigeria because the virus is endemic there. Virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or their excreta. Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients. Images of mastomys mice, the rodent reservoir of Lass fever virus, can be seen at . - Mod.TY ", "dates": ["Date: Fri 28 Jul 2017", "Plateau - 3) in week 28 2017 compared with one case from Ibadan

scores of children in a Gorakhpur Uttar Pradesh, UP hospital have put the focus on acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) and Japanese encephalitis (JE) but these deadly diseases have been creating havoc in Uttar Pradesh and other states for years. As per the data on the website of the Directorate of National Vector-Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), since 1 Jan to 13 Aug 2017, 1208 cases of AES have been reported in UP, and of these, 152 resulted in the death of the patient. In the same period, 112 cases of JE were reported in which 3 lives were lost, the data says. According to the data, another state which has been badly affected is Assam where 1534 cases of AES were reported, and 128 patients lost their lives. The state reported 482 cases of JE of which 67 resulted in death, as per the data. According to the additional director (health), Dr Pushkar Anand, 139 deaths that mostly included children have been reported from the paediatric ward of State-run Baba Raghav Das Medical College this year 2017 in UP; 6 cases of deaths were reported from 12-14 Aug 2017, he added. In UP, the most severely affected districts are Gorakhpur, Maharajganj, Kushinagar, Basti, Siddharthanagar, Sant Kabir Nagar, Deoria, and Mau. NVBDCP data reveals that in 2010, UP reported 3540 cases of AES, which claimed 494 lives. JE saw 325 cases being reported in that year, and 59 lives were lost. Similarly in 2011, 579 deaths in 3492 cases of AES were reported, while JE claimed 27 lives out of 224 cases. In 2012, a year that saw a change of government in the state, 3484 cases of AES were reported and 557 patients died, while 139 cases of JE and 23 deaths were also reported. The AES death toll breached the 600 mark for the 1st time in 2013. 609 out of 3096 cases reported resulted in deaths. JE deaths too crossed the 40-figure-mark in the same year with 47 deaths reported in 281 cases. In 2014, out of the 3329 AES cases reported, there were deaths, while for JE it was 34 deaths out of 191 cases. In 2015, as many as 479 lives were lost due to AES of which 2894 cases were reported. JE claimed 42 lives from the 351 reported cases, according to the official data. In 2016, 3919 cases of AES were reported in which 621 lives were lost. The death toll due to JE stood at an all time high of 73 out of 410 cases reported. Apart from UP, this year 2017, AES and JE deaths were reported from Assam, Bihar, Manipur, Odisha, and West Bengal. In Bihar, 29 AES deaths were reported from 66 cases reported, while 7 JE deaths were reported out of 19 cases. Manipur saw 6 AES and 6 JE deaths. As many as 690 AES cases were reported, while 141 JE cases were reported in the state. In Odisha, 10 AES deaths out of 473 cases were reported. However no death due to JE took place in the state, although 13 cases were reported. In West Bengal, 81 AES deaths took place out of 826 cases reported this year, while 10 JE deaths were reported out of 37 cases reported. Overall, 5926 cases of AES have been reported in the country till 13 Aug 2017, of which 406 deaths have been reported. The country also witnessed 93 JE deaths this year out of 903 cases reported in the same period. Speaking to PTI, Dr RN Singh, who has been working in the field of prevention of encephalitis said that until and unless, there is a complete ban on open defecation and installation of India Mark handpumps, the disease cannot be eradicated.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail As with cases of encephalitis in Uttar Pradesh and the other states in northeastern India mentioned above, not all encephalitis cases are due to JE virus infections and are classified as AES with undetermined etiology. AES is a term used for multiple etiologies or often when no etiology has been determined. The report above does not indicate whether JE vaccination campaigns have been active in the affected states this year (2017). Other etiologies for AES, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_), lychee fruit consumption, and agricultural-related toxicants have been proposed. The report above does not indicate what the etiologies of the AES cases might be. Getting to an accurate diagnosis in these cases of AES will require active field surveillance with epidemiological studies supported by timely laboratory testing. Until valid diagnoses of AES are determined and the routes of transmission are known, prevention will not be possible. The comments of Dr RN Sing in the report above citing the need for access to clean water again raise the possibility of enteropathogens as a major cause of AES. In any case, access to clean water is important for public health generally, including for AES prevention. - Mod.TY ", "dates": ["Date: Tue 15 Aug 2017 06:22 PM IST", "Aug 2017] 1208 cases of AES have been reported in UP and of these", "Assam where 1534 cases of AES were reported and 128 patients lost", " The state reported 482 cases of JE of which 67 resulted", "[2017] in UP; 6 cases of deaths were reported from [12-14 Aug 2017]", "NVBDCP data reveals that in 2010 UP reported 3540 cases of AES which", " Similarly in 2011 579 deaths in 3492 cases of AES", "were reported while JE claimed 27 lives out of 224 cases", "In 2012 a year that saw a change of government in the state 3484", "cases of AES were reported and 557 patients died while 139 cases of", "600 mark for the 1st time in 2013", " 609 out of 3096 cases reported", "same year with 47 deaths reported in 281 cases", "In 2014 out of the 3329 AES cases reported there were deaths while", "for JE it was 34 deaths out of 191 cases", " In 2015 as many as 479", "claimed 42 lives from the 351 reported cases according to the", "In 2016 3919 cases of AES were reported in which 621 lives were lost", "The death toll due to JE stood at an all time high of 73 out of 410", "as 690 AES cases were reported while 141 JE cases were reported in", "In Odisha 10 AES deaths out of 473 cases were reported", " In West Bengal 81 AES deaths took place out of 826 cases", "Overall 5926 cases of AES have been reported in the country till [13", "Aug 2017] of which 406 deaths have been reported", "witnessed 93 JE deaths this year out of 903 cases reported in the same"], "title": "Japanese encephalitis & other - India (14) "}, "220": {"sentences": "   Wed 19 Jul 2017 Source; All About Feed edited Over 100 dairy cows in New Zealand had to be put down as they had digested a fungus from their feed supply. The cows were suffering from ergot toxicity in the Southland and Otago regions following a dry summer and wet autumn, ideal conditions for the fungus to spread. Ergot is a naturally occurring fungus which is most commonly found in grains and grasses. In the most severe cases it can lead to gangrene and death after entering the blood of humans or animals. The ergot fungus grows on the seed head of cereal grains and grasses, with rye being the most commonly affected but wheat, barley and oats are also targets for it. All animals are susceptible to ergot but cattle are often the most affected. The fungus produces toxic compounds called ergot alkaloids which are vaso-active causing severe vasoconstriction of small arteries. Some cattle suffering from the fungus have been seen to lose the tips of their ears and their tails, but feet and legs can also be affected. In the most severe cases the animals can lose their hooves but mostly the fungus causes lameness and swelling of the fetlocks and hock joints. Cattle will commonly develop a rough hair coat, lose weight and have extended periods of time standing in water or shade if available.<br><br><strong> Dry summer and wet autumn -</strong><br> A total of 4 cases of ergot toxicity were initially reported in Southland and South Otago which had affected a large number of cows, according to VetSouth Winton veterinarian Hayden Dore. The vet said the dry summer and wet autumn conditions contributed to the appearance of the fungus in the region; with many of the cases he had seen affecting the hind limbs of cows. \"Over time it effectively causes one or more of the limbs to become gangrenous,\" Mr. Dore said. \"Signs of ergot toxicity generally started with a disinterest in feed, before moving to lameness in the limbs, which presented similarly to foot rot, but without the separation of the toes. Once the limbs go cold from lack of blood supply, it would take about a week before the limbs began to fall off,\" he added. One herd with 900 milking cows had around 130 cows infected by the poisonous fungus with subsequently 61 of them being put down. Another herd with 400 cows saw 41 of them being euthanised after 56 were found infected. Although the fungus has been around for thousands of years, it is most active when the environmental conditions are right, which in New Zealand has meant it is spreading fast. Some animals can recover from infection but once the limbs go cold then recovery is not possible.<br><br><strong> Prevention of spore spreading -</strong><br> Ergot spores are spread by the wind and there is no reliable test for the spores in feed. Ryegrass infected with ergot can be identified by the presence of ergot bodies which are long purple to black structures in place where seeds should be. Farmers who find these spores in their feed supply are being advised to bury it over four centimeters deep in the ground which suppresses the spores and prevents them from spreading. Byline: Chris McCullough  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Ergot is caused by a fungus known as _Claviceps purpura_ or _Claviceps paspalum_. Essentially, ergot can be divided into 2 categories, the neurological form that causes animals to stagger (_C. paspalum_) and the gangrene form (_C. purpura_). This form causes vasoconstriction such that cattle may slough their ears, the switch of their tail, or, even their hooves. It is very painful when they slough their hooves. The animals will not walk to feed or water, and euthanasia is the best option. If the animal has the neurological form of the disease, they can recover, but there is no treatment for the gangrene. The fungus invades the seed head and forms a slerotia, which is approximately twice the size of the individual grains in the seed head. It is visible, and, if producers are aware that the conditions for the fungus are right, they may be able to examine their hay fields and avoid baling infected grasses.

Similarly, 1111 AES cases have been reported, of which 87 have died,\" he said. Last year 2016, of the 1713 AES cases, 187 people had died, and of the 427 JE cases, 92 had died. The Health Minister said the government has decided to carry out JE vaccination throughout the year. \"We will increase the number of doses to 2 from this year 2017. Studies have shown that single doses are not enough. The success rate of single doses is 85 percent,\" he said. Referring to incidents in some places where people were reluctant to take the vaccines due to rumours, Sarma said that of late, people are coming forward. \"We are adopting a soft approach. We have not set any timeframe. Focus has been given on creating more awareness ... and people have started coming forward to take the vaccination,\" he said. He blamed \"so-called\" religious leaders for launching a campaign against the vaccination drive. \"Some political parties are also playing the game,\" he alleged.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. The case counts above are confusing. The 1st statement indicates that there are 131 confirmed JE and AES-related deaths etiology undetermined, and the 2nd statement reports that there are 305 positive JE cases with 44 deaths, and 1111 AES cases with 87 deaths. As noted in earlier comments, Assam state is endemic for Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus, and cases occur there every year. As with cases of encephalitis in other states in northeastern India, not all cases are due to JE virus and are classified as AES with undetermined etiology. AES is a term used for multiple etiologies or often when no etiology has been determined. As mentioned in many previous comments, the encephalitis picture in northeastern India is complicated. Although JE virus etiology of some previously reported encephalitis cases has been confirmed by laboratory tests, many cases go undiagnosed, or JE virus infection is ruled out, and other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus ( _Orientia tsutsugamushi_), and lychee fruit consumption, have been proposed. Getting to an accurate diagnosis in these cases of AES will require active field surveillance with epidemiological studies supported by timely laboratory testing. Although avoidance of mosquito bites is prudent, vector control is difficult, so vaccination is the best protective measure. The Health Minister in the above report indicates that JE vaccination will be carried out throughout the year. The virus has birds as reservoir hosts and pigs as amplifiers. The _Culex_ mosquito vectors can become very abundant seasonally, breeding in wetlands. - Mod.TY ", "dates": ["Date: Sun 16 Jul 2017", "State Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma today [16 Jul 2017] reported", "Saturday [15 Jul 2017]", "\"Till yesterday [14 Jul 2017] 305 positive cases of JE have been", "Last year [2016] of the 1713 AES cases 187 people had died and of", "the 427 JE cases 92 had died", "to 2 from this year [2017]", "positive JE cases with 44 deaths and 1111 AES cases with 87 deaths"], "title": "Japanese encephalitis & other - India (10): (AS) "}, "50": {"sentences": " 2  Fri 18 Aug 2017 Source: Pulse.com edited When news broke on Thu 17 Aug 2017 that 4 people had died in the Volta region after allegedly eating puffer fish, many have since been wondering what kind of fish that is. It is important to note puffer fish are highly poisonous and should only prepared by trained, licensed chefs who know one bad cut means almost certain death for a customer. Surprisingly, the meat of some puffer fish is considered a delicacy, especially in Japan. But here's why you should perhaps avoid it completely:  - According to National Geographic, tetrodotoxin is deadly, up to 1200 times more poisonous than cyanide. One puffer fish has enough toxin to kill 30 adults.  - The puffer fish is the 2nd most poisonous vertebrate on the planet. Its poison has no antidote and kills by paralyzing the diaphragm, causing suffocation.  - Almost all puffer fish contain tetrodotoxin, a substance that makes them taste bad (and sometimes lethal) to other fish.  - Tetrodotoxin does not cross the blood-brain barrier, so the victims remain fully conscious while their central nervous system gradually shuts down. Symptoms such as numbness in the mouth, lips, and tongue occur within 30 minutes to 3 hours from an intake and after that, the victim begins to experience headaches, nausea and even vomiting. The rest of the body slowly becomes paralysed, causing death when the heart and lung muscles are also paralysed.  - In Japan, the most lethal part, the liver, cannot be sold, and the whole fish is banned in the European Union.  - There are more than 120 species of puffer fish worldwide. Most of them are found in tropical and subtropical ocean waters. However, some species live in brackish and even fresh water. They have long, tapered bodies with bulbous heads.  - The puffer fish protects itself in the wild by gulping down water and swelling up its belly to make itself look bigger. It does this because, apparently, it can't find a way to communicate the simple message, \"I am poisonous,\" says Byline: Mildred Europa Taylor  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail And Epicore member Addo Michael Brown Tetrodotoxin is a colorless crystal substance that darkens when heated above 400 degrees F or approximately 220 C. Tetrodotoxin is an extremely potent toxin (poison) found mainly in the liver and gonads of some fish, notably puffer fish, or fugu, but also globefish (sometimes puffer fish are also called globefish), and toadfish as well as some amphibians, octopus, and shellfish species. Human poisonings occur when the flesh and/or organs of the fish are improperly prepared and eaten. Tetrodotoxin interferes with the transmission of signals from nerves to muscles and causes an increasing paralysis of the muscles of the body. Tetrodotoxin poisoning can be fatal. These creatures are likely fatal when prepared inappropriately, and should be handled with extreme caution for the everyday untrained person. We are sorry for the families of these individuals.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on _Salmonella_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using techniques called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives a more detailed DNA fingerprint than PFGE. As of  Fri 21 Jul 2017, 47 people infected with the outbreak strain of _S._ Kiambu have been reported from 12 states. States / Case Count Iowa / 1 Kentucky / 1 Louisiana / 1 Maryland / 5 Massachusetts / 1 Minnesota / 1 New Jersey / 12 New York / 13 Pennsylvania / 4 Texas / 1 Utah / 1 Virginia / 6 Total / 47 WGS showed that isolates from people infected with _S._ Kiambu are closely related genetically. This close genetic relationship means that people in this outbreak are more likely to share a common source of infection. Illnesses started on dates ranging from 17 May 2017 to 28 Jun 2017. Ill people range in age from less than one year to 95, with a median age of 27. Among ill people, 67 percent are female. Among 31 people with available information, 18 (58 percent) are of Hispanic ethnicity. Among 33 people with available information, 12 (36 percent) report being hospitalized. One death was reported from New York City.<br><br><strong> Investigation of the Outbreak -</strong><br> Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence collected to date indicate that yellow Maradol papayas are a likely source of this multistate outbreak. This investigation is ongoing. In interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the week before they became ill. Eleven (44 percent) of 25 people interviewed reported eating papayas. This proportion was significantly higher than results from a survey of healthy Hispanic people in which 16 percent reported eating papayas in the months of May and June 2017 in the week before they were interviewed. An illness cluster in Maryland was identified. An illness cluster is defined as 2 or more people who do not live in the same household who report eating at the same restaurant location, attending a common event, or shopping at the same location of a grocery store in the week before becoming ill. In Maryland, several ill people reported eating papayas purchased from the same location of a grocery store. _S._ Kiambu and _S._ Thompson were isolated from samples collected from ill people. Investigating illness clusters provides critical clues about the source of an outbreak. If several unrelated ill people ate or shopped at the same location of a restaurant or store within several days of each other, it suggests that the contaminated food item was served or sold there. The Maryland Department of Health collected papayas from the grocery store associated with the illness cluster to test for _Salmonella_. One sample yielded the outbreak strain of _S._ Kiambu and another sample yielded _S._ Thompson. Both samples were from yellow Maradol papayas. WGS showed that the _S._ Kiambu papaya isolate is closely related genetically to the _S._ Kiambu isolates from ill people. This result provides more evidence that people in this outbreak got sick from eating contaminated yellow Maradol papayas. CDC is working to collect additional information to determine whether the recent _S._ Thompson illness in Maryland is part of this multistate outbreak. Based on the available evidence, CDC recommends that consumers not eat, restaurants not serve, and retailers not sell yellow Maradol papayas until we learn more. CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill people and to interview them. Further investigation is under way to determine the point in the supply chain where the papayas were contaminated. Updates will be provided when more information is available.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Now that CDC has released its initial investigation report, the outbreak is clearly outside of just Maryland see ProMED-mail post http://promedmail.org/post/20170721.5195333 - Mod.JH, but to date, most cases are located on the eastern seaboard. The fruit of the papaya (also called papaw or pawpaw)   is from the _Carica papaya_ , one of the 22 accepted species in the genus _Carica_ of the family Caricaceae. It is native to the tropics of the Americas, perhaps from southern Mexico and neighboring Central America. It was 1st cultivated in Mexico several centuries before the emergence of the Mesoamerican classical civilizations. The male produces only pollen, never fruit. The female will produce small, inedible fruits unless pollinated. Two kinds of papayas are commonly grown. One has sweet, red or orange flesh, and the other has yellow flesh; in Australia, these are called \"red papaya\" and \"yellow papaw\", respectively. Either kind, picked green, is called a \"green papaya\". The large-fruited, red-fleshed 'Maradol', 'Sunrise', and 'Caribbean Red' papayas often sold in US markets are commonly grown in Mexico and Belize.

Based on calculations of how many mosquitoes get onto commercial aircraft, how many are infected, and how many survive long enough at the destination to bite someone, the study estimates human travelers are 200 times more likely to spread dengue virus and 1000 times more likely to introduce _Plasmodium falciparum_, the parasite that causes malaria. \"Pathogens such as the Zika and chikungunya viruses have drawn a lot of interest lately and are showing up in travelers,\" said senior study author Michael Johansson, a biologist at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Division of Vector-Borne Diseases in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Insects that transport disease, such as mosquitoes, have been introduced via airlines to geographic areas where they didn't previous live, the authors write in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Airports have insect-elimination, or \"disinsection,\" policies mandated by the UN's International Health Regulations. They typically use insecticides to try to kill insects in bags, cargo, containers, and conveyor belts, but infections still occur. \"We've had disinsection policies for a long time, which are targeted at mosquito species and agricultural pests,\" Johansson told Reuters Health in a phone interview. \"But we need to focus on ways to prevent the spread through humans.\" The study team assessed scenarios for the spread of mosquito-borne diseases, focusing on areas where either malaria or dengue are \"endemic,\" or widespread, and places where the diseases are not endemic, but conditions are favorable for them to establish themselves. Based on past studies, the researchers calculated how many mosquitoes would likely be on any given plane, and how many of them would be infected with disease. For instance, the largest number of mosquitoes ever detected on a plane in past research is 17 _Anopheles gambiae_ mosquitoes, the primary transmitters of malaria, the researchers note. For the current study, they estimated a 0.25 probability of any mosquito on a given flight, or an average of one mosquito on every 4th plane. They also calculated the infection rates for human travelers, likelihood of mosquito bites at the destination, and probability of disease transmission to a new person. Even in the absence of mosquito control or disinsection on planes, humans were hundreds of times more likely to spread the diseases through travel. Overall, the probability that an airplane traveling from a mosquito-heavy area would lead to infection was extremely low. \"We expected to find this, but we were surprised by the magnitude,\" Johansson said. \"We didn't think it would be so obvious, and this was focusing on the worst-case scenarios.\" Future studies should focus on preventing human transmission, he added. Policies around preventing the transportation of infected mosquitoes won't likely work, the study authors conclude. \"There may be a misperception about how pathogens disperse globally,\" said Moritz Kraemer of Harvard Medical School in Boston, who wasn't involved in the study. \"With the increase in travel globally, infectious diseases spread quickly from one location to another,\" he told Reuters Health by email. Pathways and directionality is also important, he added. \"One aspect that is still difficult to assess is which travelers are at highest risk of infection,\" he said. \"The most exciting thing about this study is that it shows the differences between dengue and malaria and the risk of mosquito versus human-driven importation.\" Byline: Carolyn Crist  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\.

Both dengue and Zika viruses have been imported into Florida, USA by viremic individuals, with resulting ongoing transmission by _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes. The travel of 11 Chinese workers infected with yellow fever virus from Angola to China was a serious wake up call and illustration of the risk of infected individuals bringing the virus into areas where the vector is present. Fortunately, in that case, it was during the colder season when the vectors, mosquitoes, were not active. An example of where an individual infected with chikungunya virus in India, sparked an outbreak after he traveled to an area in Ramini, Ravenna province in north-eastern Italy in 2007, where _Aedes albopictus_, a competent vector mosquito, was abundant enough to initiate on-going transmission. Transport of infected mosquitoes cannot be completely dismissed. The introduction of West Nile virus into New York city in 1999 was likely due to transport of an infected mosquito in a commercial aircraft, since human viremias are not sufficient to provide infectious blood meals for mosquitoes. - Mod.TY Spread of diseases by mosquitoes hitch-hiking in airplanes is rare if we look at reported cases of so-called \"airport malaria\".

A 2013 paper (Claeys WL, Cardoen S, Daube G, et al. Raw or heated cow milk consumption: review of risks and benefits. Food Control 2013; 31(1): 251-62) is available at  . It addresses the arguments that pasteurization removes significant nutrients from milk. The abstract, introduction, and conclusions are given below with the citations removed. Abstract: \"In the context of the prevailing trend toward more natural products, there seems to be an increasing preference for raw milk consumption, as raw milk is associated with several perceived health benefits that are believed to be destroyed upon heating. However, many human pathogens can be isolated from raw cow milk. The prevalence of foodborne pathogens in raw cow milk varies, but their presence has been demonstrated in many surveys, and foodborne infections have been repeatedly reported for campylobacter, _Salmonella_ spp. and human pathogenic verocytotoxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ VTEC. In industrialized countries, milkborne and milk product-borne outbreaks represent 2-6 per cent of the bacterial foodborne outbreaks. \"The aim of this review is to present scientifically sound data regarding the risks and benefits related to the consumption of raw and heated cow milk. Both microbiological aspects (such as the prevalence of milk-borne pathogens, pathogen growth inhibition by antimicrobial systems and by lactic acid producing bacteria, probiotic bacteria, etc.) and nutritional or health aspects (nutritional value, immunity, allergies, lactose intolerance, diabetes, milk digestibility, etc) are considered. \"As such, it is demonstrated that consumption of raw milk poses a realistic health threat due to a possible contamination with human pathogens. It is therefore strongly recommended that milk should be heated before consumption. With the exception of an altered organoleptic profile taste, heating (in particular ultra-high temperature and similar treatments) will not substantially change the nutritional value of raw milk or other benefits associated with raw milk consumption.<br><br><strong> \"Introduction </strong><br> \"The consumption of raw milk is not well-documented, but in the context of the current trend toward 'consuming natural' and 'purchasing locally', raw milk consumption is becoming more popular. This is nourished by the perception that heating destroys the nutritional and health benefits of milk, and can even induce some detrimental effects. However, due to its high nutritional value together with the neutral pH and high water activity content?, raw milk serves as an excellent growth medium for different micro-organisms, whose multiplication depends mainly on temperature and on competing microorganisms and their metabolic products. In order to guarantee its microbial safety and to prolong its shelf-life, milk is heat treated. \"The impact of milk pasteurization on public health can be clearly illustrated by means of historical data. Before 1938, an estimated 25 per cent of all foodborne and waterborne disease outbreaks in the USA were associated with milk, whereas nowadays, the percentage of such outbreaks associated with milk is estimated to be below one per cent. Between 1880 and 1907, 29 milkborne outbreaks were reported on average each year in the USA. With the adoption of pasteurization in 1938, milkborne diseases dropped to only 46 outbreaks during the 19-year period from 1973 to 1992, corresponding to an average of 2.4 outbreaks each year. A recent report of the USA CDC indicates that the vast majority of milkborne outbreaks in the USA are in states that permit the sale of raw milk. In England and Wales, the great majority of milkborne outbreaks during the 1980s were attributed to the consumption of raw milk. In Scotland, a similar situation existed until the sale of unpasteurized milk was prohibited in 1983, which led to a significant drop of the incidence of diseases related to liquid milk consumption. \"In the mid-20th century, the main illnesses associated with raw milk consumption were brucellosis and tuberculosis. These have been eradicated as milkborne diseases in developed countries, mainly through herd certification programs which included culling of infected animals, the installation of refrigerated bulk tanks for milk collection on farms, and the introduction of pasteurization. In the past, pasteurization conditions were standardized based on the destruction of _Mycobacterium bovis_, a relatively heat-resistant non-sporogenic bacterium that formerly was among the most serious pathogenic bacteria present in milk. Pasteurization standards today are based upon the destruction of _Coxiella burnetii_, the most heat-resistant milkborne zoonotic pathogen known. In the past 30 years, several previously unrecognized foodborne bacterial infections, including infection with _Campylobacter jejuni_, _Listeria monocytogenes_, and _Escherichia coli_ strain O157 (or more general verocytotoxin-producing pathogenic _E. coli_ VTEC), have emerged as significant causes of human morbidity and mortality. Pathogens mainly present in raw milk today are, among others, _C. jejuni_, _Salmonella_ spp., _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Listeria monocytogenes_, pathogenic _E. coli_ and _Yersinia enterocolitica_. \"In Europe, the current regulatory microbial criteria for raw cow milk are less than or equal to 100 000 colony forming units (cfu)/ml for plate count (at 30 C / 86 F) and less than or equal to 400 000 cfu/ml for somatic cells, as is stipulated in Regulation (EC) 853/2004 laying down specific hygiene rules on the hygiene of foodstuffs. In this Regulation, health requirements for production animals and hygienic requirements on milk production holdings (such as regarding premises and equipment, hygiene during milking, collection, and transport, staff hygiene) are established as well. In general, raw milk intended for human consumption must meet the requirements of the General Food Law (Regulation (EC) 178/2002) and be free of pathogens. Even though improvements in hygiene resulted in routine production of raw cow milk with less than 20 000 cfu (total flora)/ml), this does not guarantee raw milk to be free of pathogens. In approximately 1-6 per cent of the human outbreaks reported in developed countries, milk has been identified as the vehicle of infection. An overview of foodborne disease reports from different industrialized countries indicates that milk and milk products are implicated in 1-5 per cent of the total bacterial foodborne outbreaks, with 39.1 per cent attributed to milk, 53.1 per cent to cheese, and 7.8 per cent to other milk products. \"Whereas milk quality and safety has been the topic of many research studies, raw milk still continues to be an issue for debate, which is primarily held on the internet where often non-scientifically based information circulates. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the risks and benefits related to the consumption of raw cow milk at one hand, and to evaluate the effect of heat treatments of milk on these risks and benefits on the other hand, considering the microbiological as well as the nutritional (health) aspects.<br><br><strong> \"Conclusions -</strong><br> \"In this evaluation it is clearly demonstrated that the consumption of raw milk poses a realistic and unnecessary health threat because of its possible contamination with pathogenic bacteria. It is therefore recommended to heat raw milk before consumption, especially when served to young children, pregnant women, or any person suffering from a chronic disease or a suppressed immune system. In this context the attention is drawn to raw milk provided on farms to the general public (such as during a school visit) and raw milk distributors allowing the automatic supply of raw milk from a bulk reservoir to the consumer. \"Historical data show that the pasteurization of milk has led to improved public health, and more recent data on occasional raw milk consumption indicate the hazard of bacterial infections, which could be avoided by a heat treatment. At present, thermal treatment remains the most frequently used and most effective method to increase the microbiological safety of milk without substantially changing the nutritional value of milk or other benefits associated with raw milk consumption. Table 4 see original URL above summarizes the main (claimed) benefits of raw milk consumption and the (claimed) detrimental effects of heating discussed in the present paper. Almost all arguments put forward by raw milk proponents for not heating milk, can be refuted, and the only substantial disadvantage of heating is the change in the organoleptic profile taste of milk. It is clear that this 'detrimental' effect of heating does not countervail the risk posed by raw milk consumption, namely of a milkborne pathogen infection, which can have serious health consequences.\" - Mod.LL   .

Oxfam projected the number could rise to more than 600 000 cases, \"the largest ever recorded in any country in a single year since records began\", exceeding Haiti in 2011. Nigel Timmins, the charity's humanitarian director who has just returned from the country, said: \"Cholera has spread unchecked in a country already on its knees after 2 years of war and which is teetering on the brink of famine. For many people, weakened by war and hunger, cholera is the knockout blow.\" The WHO reported 368 207 suspected cases and 1828 deaths in the Arabian Peninsula country since late April 2017. \"Every day we have 5000 more Yemenis falling sick with symptoms of acute watery diarrhea or cholera,\" WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told a news briefing in Geneva. \"Yemen's cholera outbreak is far from being controlled, the rainy season has just started and may increase the paths of transmission. Sustained efforts are required to stop the spread of this disease,\" she said. Millions are malnourished in Yemen where famine looms, the UN says. A Saudi Arabia-led coalition intervened in Yemen's civil war in 2015, backing government forces fighting Iran-allied Houthi rebels and fighting limits access for aid workers. Surveillance data \"confirms a slight decline in suspected cases over the past 2 weeks\" in some of the most affected governorates  Amanat Al Asimah, Amran, and Sana'a, Chaib said. But great caution was called for as there is a backlog in reporting and data is still being analyzed, she said. Oxfam, which is based in Britain, said Yemen's rainy season from July to September would increase the risk of the disease spreading further through water contaminated with faeces. \"It is feared that the total number of people infected could eventually rise to over 600 000, making it one of the largest outbreaks since records began in 1949,\" Oxfam said. The WHO did not provide its latest planning figure. \"The fighting is hugely exacerbating the ability to stop this epidemic of cholera. The kind of disintegration of the health system in Yemen as a result of the conflict at a time of cholera is an absolutely lethal combination,\" UN human rights spokesman Rupert Colville told Friday's 21 Jul 2017 briefing.

This is the 1st anthrax case in Texas this year 2017. The premises is located approximately 13 miles east of Ozona and has been quarantined. TAHC rules require proper disposal of affected carcasses and vaccination of other cattle on the premise prior to release of the quarantine. \"The TAHC will continue to closely monitor the situation,\" said Dr Susan Rollo, TAHC State Epidemiologist. \"Producers are encouraged to remain vigilant and consult with their local veterinary practitioner if they suspect their animals are affected with anthrax or are interested in vaccinating their livestock.\" Anthrax is a bacterial disease caused by _Bacillus anthracis_, which is a naturally occurring organism with worldwide distribution, including certain parts of Texas. Anthrax cases in Texas are historically found in the triangular area bound by the towns of Uvalde, Ozona and Eagle Pass. This area includes portions of Crockett, Val Verde, Sutton, Edwards, Kinney and Maverick counties. A vaccine is available for use in susceptible livestock in high risk areas. Acute fever followed by rapid death with bleeding from body openings are common signs of anthrax in livestock. Carcasses may also appear bloated and appear to decompose quickly. Livestock or animals displaying symptoms consistent with anthrax should be reported to a private veterinary practitioner or a TAHC official. If affected livestock or carcasses must be handled, producers are encouraged to follow basic sanitation precautions such as wearing protective gloves, long sleeve shirts and washing thoroughly afterward to prevent accidental spread of the bacteria to people. For more information about Anthrax, visit  , or contact your local TAHC region office, or visit  . Crockett is in western Texas, immediately north of Val Verde. It is rough country, and tree covered. Normally anthrax outbreaks in Texas start in June so this year 2017 we are running a bit late. Until the spring of 2016, when it broke, there had been a 3 year drought in this area. That drought would have killed anthrax spores in a number of places and the pathogen is having relative problems recovering. Unfortunately an absence of outbreaks can encourage procrastination in vaccinating. And as this disease is enzootic in deer in this area, eradication is impossible until we can develop an effective and cheap oral vaccine for the white tail deer. As they are trained to come to feeding stations, to support their numbers, breeding, and shooting, delivery of an oral vaccine is not a problem. Back in 2007 we did proof of concept trial feeding Sterne vaccine to goats, and it was successful. See: Shakya, Krishna P., Martin Hugh-Jones, and Philip H.

La principal v\u00eda de transmisi\u00f3n del virus pand\u00e9mico parece ser la misma que la del virus estacional, es decir, las got\u00edculas de secreciones respiratorias que se expulsan al hablar, estornudar o toser.  Usted puede evitar infectarse si aplica las medidas siguientes:  al\u00e9jese de las personas que presenten s\u00edntomas gripales, como tos y estornudos (si es posible, trate de mantener una distancia de por lo menos un metro);  l\u00e1vese muy bien las manos con agua y jab\u00f3n o l\u00edmpieselas regularmente con un desinfectante a base de alcohol (sobre todo si toca usted superficies que puedan estar contaminadas);  haga todo lo posible por no tocarse la boca, la nariz ni los ojos;  de ser posible, disminuya el tiempo que pasa en aglomeraciones;  abra las ventanas para mejorar la ventilaci\u00f3n del sitio en que se encuentra;  practique buenos h\u00e1bitos higi\u00e9nicos (como dormir lo suficiente, consumir alimentos nutritivos y mantener la actividad f\u00edsica); y  si es posible, vac\u00fanese contra la gripe pand\u00e9mica y procure que se vacunen los miembros de su familia de 6 meses de edad o mayores.  \u00bfQu\u00e9 recomienda la OMS sobre el uso de mascarillas?  Si usted no est\u00e1 enfermo, no tiene que llevar mascarilla.  Si usted est\u00e1 atendiendo a un enfermo, puede ponerse la mascarilla cuando est\u00e9 en contacto estrecho con \u00e9l y desecharla inmediatamente despu\u00e9s, sin olvidarse de lavarse muy bien las manos.  Consejos sobre la utilizaci\u00f3n de mascarillas  Es esencial que la mascarilla se utilice correctamente en todas las circunstancias. Su uso incorrecto puede en realidad aumentar las probabilidades de propagar la infecci\u00f3n.  \u00bfC\u00f3mo puedo saber si padezco la gripe pand\u00e9mica?  Hoy en d\u00eda, debido a que el virus gripal H1N1 pand\u00e9mico es el virus circulante que predomina en todo el mundo, la mayor parte de los casos de gripe probablemente son de tipo pand\u00e9mico.  Conviene estar atento a la aparici\u00f3n de s\u00edntomas como fiebre, tos, dolor de cabeza, dolores corporales, faringoamigdalitis y rinorrea.  La OMS aconseja al personal sanitario que trate a las personas bas\u00e1ndose en la presencia de s\u00edntomas gripales y la evoluci\u00f3n del cuadro cl\u00ednico, sin esperar a que la gripe pand\u00e9mica se confirme mediante pruebas de laboratorio. El virus gripal H1N1 pand\u00e9mico ya se ha propagado por todo el mundo.  Por lo que respecta a las pruebas de laboratorio, las autoridades sanitarias y los asociados de la OMS siguen practicando pruebas selectivas en los pacientes con s\u00edndrome gripal para caracterizar los brotes, monitorear el virus y conocer las tendencias de la enfermedad.  \u00bfQu\u00e9 debo hacer si creo haber contra\u00eddo la gripe?  Si usted se siente mal y tiene fiebre, tos o faringoamigdalitis:  Qu\u00e9dese en casa y no vaya al trabajo o la escuela, y evite las aglomeraciones.  Descanse y beba muchos l\u00edquidos.  C\u00fabrase la boca y la nariz cuando tosa o estornude. Si utiliza pa\u00f1uelos desechables, elim\u00ednelos con cuidado. Inmediatamente despu\u00e9s, l\u00e1vese las manos con agua y jab\u00f3n o l\u00edmpieselas con un desinfectante a base de alcohol.  Si no tiene un pa\u00f1uelo cuando tose o estornuda, c\u00fabrase la boca y la nariz todo cuanto pueda metiendo el rostro en el \u00e1ngulo formado por el brazo y el antebrazo.  Cuando est\u00e9 cerca de otras personas p\u00f3ngase una mascarilla para ayudar a contener la dispersi\u00f3n de got\u00edculas respiratorias, pero cerci\u00f3rese de usarla correctamente.  Informe a su familia y amigos que est\u00e1 enfermo y trate de evitar el contacto con otras personas.  Si es posible, llame a un profesional sanitario antes de dirigirse a un establecimiento asistencial para averiguar si es necesario someterse a un examen m\u00e9dico.  \u00bfDebo tomar un antiv\u00edrico ahora por si acaso me infecto con el nuevo virus?  En general, la OMS no recomienda el uso de antiv\u00edricos para prevenir la gripe pand\u00e9mica. Estos medicamentos solo deben tomarse si los prescribe el m\u00e9dico.  En algunos casos, las autoridades sanitarias pueden proporcionar antiv\u00edricos como medida preventiva a determinadas personas que presentan un riesgo especial o en ciertas situaciones sanitarias especiales.  Por lo general, estos medicamentos solo se obtienen con receta m\u00e9dica, aunque algunos pa\u00edses han hechos excepciones durante la epidemia para garantizar el pronto acceso a los antiv\u00edricos.  Se debe tener mucho cuidado cuando los antiv\u00edricos se compran por Internet.  Warning on purchase of antivirals without a prescription pdf, 35kb  \u00bfSe debe interrumpir el amamantamiento si la madre contrae la gripe?  No, a menos que lo aconseje el personal sanitario. Los estudios realizados a prop\u00f3sito de otras formas de la gripe han revelado que la lactancia materna muy probablemente protege a la criatura porque de este modo recibe anticuerpos maternos y con ello se reduce el riesgo de infecciones respiratorias. La lactancia materna representa la mejor forma de nutrici\u00f3n global para los beb\u00e9s y aumenta sus defensas para combatir enfermedades.  \u00bfCu\u00e1ndo se debe buscar atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica?  Una persona debe acudir al m\u00e9dico si presenta dificultad para respirar o fiebre que se prolonga por m\u00e1s de tres d\u00edas. En el caso de un ni\u00f1o peque\u00f1o, los padres deben llevarlo al m\u00e9dico si presenta respiraci\u00f3n acelerada o dif\u00edcil, fiebre continua o convulsiones.  En la mayor parte de los casos, los cuidados de sost\u00e9n en casa \u2014reposo, beber muchos l\u00edquidos y tomar un analg\u00e9sico para combatir el dolor\u2014 son suficientes para recuperarse. En los ni\u00f1os y adultos j\u00f3venes se debe usar un analg\u00e9sico que no sea el \u00e1cido acetilsalic\u00edlico para evitar el riesgo de s\u00edndrome de Reye.  \u00bfDebo ir a trabajar si tengo gripe pero me siento bien?  No; debe quedarse en casa y no ir al trabajo mientras tenga s\u00edntomas. De esta manera ayudar\u00e1 a proteger a sus compa\u00f1eros de trabajo y a otras personas.  \u00bfPuedo viajar?

Majority of these patients are being treated in different hospitals in Kathmandu. 9 children with laboratory confirmed ST received treatment at STIDH and recovered uneventfully. It is quite surprising for me observing such a large number of ST cases being detected in Kathmandu, the biggest and most densely populated area of Nepal. Because ST has previously been almost exclusively detected in rural areas of Nepal. What is not yet clear is the impact of ST between the years 2004 and 2015. ST was first well documented in 2004 in Kathmandu (1), while the significant number of ST cases has only been detected since 2015. The widespread use of antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin, could be one possible explanation. In other words, healthcare workers in Nepal usually view any fever as typhoid fever, thus used to treat febrile patients with ciprofloxacin, which might have also worked simultaneously against ST too. However, nowadays, cefixime has become the drug of choice for typhoid fever, and it may, however, not work effectively against ST, resulting in emergence of ST in Nepal.<br><br><strong> Reference -</strong><br> 1.

Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, MD, PhD Clinical Research Unit Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital Kathmandu Nepal ProMED-mail thanks Dr Sher Bahadur Pun for his continued contributions on scrub typhus in Nepal. Doxycycline is the drug of choice and it is preferred over other tetracyclines for treatment of scrub typhus; it is rarely associated with staining of teeth in children younger than 8 years (1). Macrolides, such as azithromycin, are also reported to be efficacious (2). Fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, have been reported to be clinically effective in the treatment of scrub typhus in a few patients. However, some clinical studies suggest that fluoroquinolones are not as effective in patients with scrub typhus as other antibiotics (3,4). In vitro testing of some strains of _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, the cause of scrub typhus, has been reported to show resistance to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin (minimum inhibitory concentration=8 micrograms/mL) (5) and mutation in the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) of the gyrA gene associated with fluoroquinolone resistance has been found (3,5). These findings suggest that fluoroquinolones are likely not appropriate for the treatment of scrub typhus.<br><br><strong> References </strong><br> 1. Panpanich R, Garner P.

Evidence shows mosquitoes capable of carrying Zika virus may have a colony in Ontario. Staff from the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit recently found the insect in a trap, a discovery health officials believe signals the species is becoming established in southern Ontario. \"It was just in such good shape, we are absolutely 100 per cent sure of what species it is,\" said Fiona Hunter, from Brock University, who heads up the lab that tested Windsor's mosquitoes. \"It didn't just blow in from the (United) States.\" Last week week ending 20 Aug 2017, the health unit revealed 2 _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes, also known as the Asian tiger mosquito, had also been found in the area. \"Once they establish themselves here it would be more difficult to control and maybe we'll see some diseases we haven't seen before,\" said Dr Wajid Ahmed, the region's acting medical officer of health, at the time. Having the Asian tiger mosquito show up in Canada was a bit of a surprise, considering it wasn't expected to migrate north for at least another decade, Hunter explained. But the odds of it arriving is still higher than the latest species. \"The Asian tiger mosquito is known to exist farther north in the (United) States ... but _Aedes aegypti_ is supposed to be sub-tropical and tropical - Mod.TY, so what on earth is it doing here?\" All aedes mosquitoes found in Windsor-Essex so far have tested negative for both the Zika and West Nile virus. Given there are no active cases of the diseases, there's less cause for alarm, according to Hunter. \"I think it's alarming  for the country  that our climate is changing,\" she said. \"In the last decade we've added another 10 mosquito species to our endemic list ... so we know something is going on.\"  communicated by: ProMED-mail Although finding _Aedes aegypti_ in southern Canada is a surprise, one should remember that this tropical and sub-tropical species became seasonally established along the east coast of the USA and was responsible for yellow fever outbreaks in northern cities such as Philadelphia more than 200 years ago. However, it will not become established in Canada for the same reason it has not become established in the north central and north east states of the USA. However, _Aedes albopictus_ distribution is another matter. This species has been extending its known range northward and recently has been found in Nebraska, Connecticut, Indiana, Ohio, Minnesota and Wisconsin, 3 of which border Ontario across the Great Lakes . Unlike _A. aegypti_, _A. albopictus_ eggs can go into diapause and withstand freezing winter temperatures. A University of Wisconsin-Madison entomologist Susan Paskewitz points out that viable populations of this species have not yet become established in these northern states and it seems unlikely that they will in Ontario either. However, continued surveillance for both is prudent. - Mod.TY   .

KS, edited The Ministry of Public Health (MINSAP) announced that it has registered cases of conjunctivitis in the provinces of Havana, Guantanamo, Santiago de Cuba, Holguin, Granma and Las Tunas in statements by Dr. Francisco Dur\u00a1n, national director of Epidemiology, released by the official Cuban News Agency (ACN). The news, which appeared in the official press after independent media had reported the outbreak, summarized the situation: \"Since 2016, there is an outbreak of epidemic hemorrhagic conjunctivitis in countries of this region of the Americas, mainly in Haiti and the Dominican Republic\" and measures have been taken by Cuban authorities \"to prevent its spread\". Dur\u00a1n explained to the ACN that \"this viral disease affects all ages and is epidemic because it is highly transmissible through interpersonal contact with and microdroplets of saliva from an infected person.\" The specialist emphasized the importance of the care that the population should take in the summer, \"especially if you take into account that this virus also spreads through ocular secretions that can remain on tables, counters, buses, and personal objects or in the environment \". The official insisted on \"reinforcing measures, including hand washing, as well as eliminating flies and cockroaches, insects that can also transmit the disease.\" He said that swimming pools - not well chlorinated - and places with high concentrations of people are highly vulnerable to spreading infection. The epidemiologist noted that people experiencing \"eye irritation, tearing, sensitivity to light, eyelid edema, redness of the eyes and general malaise should be examined by a physician.\" According to the specialist, \"for the treatment of this condition, within in the first 5 days of development, do not apply eye drops or drugs used in other types of conjunctivitis, only cold compresses.\" An unofficial source had indicated that the number of diagnoses of conjunctivitis in Guantanamo had exceeded 700 by early July 2017. While we were preparing this report, we learned cases of viral conjunctivitis had also been reported in Santiago de Cuba and La Habana. Dur\u00a1n said that \"in the last 6 years there have been no cases of epidemiological hemorrhagic conjunctivitis in Cuba\" and insisted that \"the countries with the highest incidence are currently Haiti and the Dominican Republic.\" Epidemic hemorrhagic conjunctivitis was first identified in Ghana in 1969 and was unknown in Cuba until August 1981, the ACN notes. It is more frequent in coastal areas of tropical countries with high temperatures and humidity and its incidence is greater during the rainy season. In this region of Central America and the Caribbean it primarily appears between the months of September and December, according to specialists. The authorities point out as a possible cause of this epidemic \"the dust from the Sahara Desert, which spreads to the Caribbean at certain times of the year, and also causes skin irritation and afflictions of the tonsils, mouth, nose and other parts of the body.\"  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-ESP Viruses cause up to 80 percent of all cases of acute conjunctivitis, but many cases are misdiagnosed as bacterial conjunctivitis. Between 65 and 90 percent of cases of viral conjunctivitis are caused by adenoviruses. Conjunctivitis may accompany the common cold and other systemic viral infections (especially measles, but also chickenpox, rubella, and mumps). Localized viral conjunctivitis without systemic manifestations usually results from adenoviruses and sometimes enteroviruses. Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis usually results from adenovirus serotypes Ad 5, 8, 11, 13, 19, and 37 and tends to cause severe conjunctivitis. Pharyngoconjunctival fever usually results from serotypes Ad 3, 4, and 7. Outbreaks of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, a rare conjunctivitis associated with infection by enterovirus type 70, have occurred in Africa and Asia. Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) is an epidemic form of highly contagious conjunctivitis and is characterized by sudden onset of painful, swollen, red eyes, with conjunctival hemorrhaging and excessive tearing. Since 1981, when AHC was 1st detected in the Western Hemisphere, 3 major epidemics had occurred until 2003, all affecting the Caribbean. During August to October 2003, a 4th epidemic occurred in Puerto Rico (2000 population: 3.8 million). The Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDOH) documented an estimated 490 000 persons with illness, including over 51 000 cases reported by physicians; demonstrated laboratory evidence of Coxsackievirus A24 (CA24); and determined that school-aged children (i.e., aged 5 to 18 years) and those living in crowded urban areas were at highest risk. Lymphadenopathy is observed in up to 50 percent of viral conjunctivitis cases and is more prevalent in viral conjunctivitis compared with bacterial conjunctivitis. Herpes simplex virus comprises 1.3 to 4.8 percent of all cases of acute conjunctivitis. Conjunctivitis caused by the virus is usually unilateral. The discharge is thin and watery, and accompanying vesicular eyelid lesions may be present. See references below for full articles: 1. . 2.

Rainfall has aggravated the disease. The growers feel that about 20 to 30 per cent of the crops have been damaged. Fruit rot is a fungal disease. The affected leaves turn black and branches start decaying. Agriculture experts have urged the growers to initiate measures to prevent the spread of disease. \"The roots of the coffee plants should be cleared. If a plant is affected, then such leaves and beans should be destroyed. Bordeaux mixture copper sulfate should be sprayed before the monsoon,\" the Coffee Board said. ICAR Indian Council of Agricultural Research organised a demonstration on controlling bacterial wilt affecting pepper vines.  communicated by: ProMED-mail It is unclear which diseases the report above refers to. Reliable diagnosis of the pathogen(s) involved is needed for successful management of the problems. For coffee, a number of fungal diseases exist that can affect fruits: Anthracnose (_Colletotrichum gloeosporioides_) has been reported from India, but it affects not only fruits, but also leaves and stems. Thread blight (_Corticium koleroga_) of coffee is known to occur in Karnataka (for example, ProMED-mail post http://promedmail.org/post/20130821.1891616), the symptoms of which include rot on leaves, twigs and berries followed by defoliation, berry drop and dieback. Coffee berry disease (_Colletotrichum kahawae_), which could be considered a 'fruit rot', has so far only been reported from Africa. For black pepper, no references to any 'bacterial wilt' can be located, but in general, bacterial wilts due to, for example, _Ralstonia_ or _Xanthomonas_ species can affect many crops. However, pepper berries as well as other parts of the vines can be affected by fungal anthracnose (_C. gloeosporoides). Quick wilt (also called foot rot; _Phytophthora capsici_) affects the whole plant and is considered the most serious threat to this crop in India.

Onset dates ranged from 25 Apr 2017 to 6 Jun 2017. Of these 5 cases, one was female. The median age was 55 years (range 41 to 68 years). The case patients were reported from Beijing (1), Guangxi (1), Guizhou (1), Hunan (1), and Zhejiang (1). At the time of notification, there was one death. Four cases were diagnosed as having severe pneumonia. Three cases were reported to have had exposure to poultry or live poultry market, and 2 had no known poultry exposure. No case clustering was reported. On Sat 24 Jun 2017, the NHFPC reported 10 laboratory-confirmed human cases of infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in China. Onset dates ranged from 5 to 19 Jun 2017. All cases were male. The median age was 53.5 years (range 31 to 79 years). The cases were reported from Anhui (1), Beijing (2), Guizhou (1), Hebei (1), Inner Mongolia (1), Jiangsu (1), Sichuan (2), and Tianjin (1). This is the 1st case reported in Inner Mongolia since the virus emerged in 2013 although 2 cases were recently reported from Shaanxi province but who had likely exposure in Inner Mongolia. At the time of notification, there were 2 deaths. Eight cases were diagnosed as having either pneumonia (4) or severe pneumonia (4). Nine cases were reported to have had exposure to poultry or live poultry market, and one had no known poultry exposure. One cluster with 2 cases was reported and both cases are from Panzhihua City, Sichuan Province, and had exposure to the same live poultry market. The cluster includes: A 79-year-old male, who had symptom onset on Mon 12 Jun 2017 and was admitted to hospital with severe pneumonia on Thu 15 Jun 2017, then died on Wed 21 Jun 2017. He was living on an upper floor of the live poultry market and passed regularly through the market. A 48-year-old male, who had symptom onset on Wed 7 Jun 2017 and was admitted to hospital with severe pneumonia on Sun 11 Jun 2017. He is a seller of poultry at the same live poultry market. On Fri 30 Jun 2017, the NHFPC reported 6 laboratory-confirmed human cases of infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in China. Onset dates ranged from 11 to 23 Jun 2017. Three cases were male. The median age was 37.5 years (range 4 to 72 years). The cases were reported from Guizhou (1), Shanxi (1), and Yunnan (4) provinces. At the time of notification no associated deaths were reported. Four cases were diagnosed as having either pneumonia (1) or severe pneumonia (3). Two mild cases, identified through ILI surveillance, were reported: one in a child with exposure to market poultry and one in an adult. Five cases were reported to have had exposure to poultry or live poultry market, and one had no known poultry exposure. These are the 1st cases reported with exposure to the virus in Yunnan province. Previous cases reported from Yunnan province had likely exposure in a neighbouring province. One cluster with 2 cases was reported, which include: A 33-year-old female from Wenshan, Yunnan Province had symptom onset on Sat 17 Jun 2017 and was admitted to hospital with severe pneumonia on the same day. She had no apparent exposure to live poultry. Her sister-in-law, a 42-year-old female also from Wenshan, Yunnan Province, visited her in the hospital, developed mild symptoms on Wed 21 Jun 2017 and was hospitalized on Sat 24 Jun 2017. Investigation of the case revealed that she ran a shop near a live poultry market and bought live poultry from the market on a daily basis before her symptom onset. The investigation concluded that the likely source of her infection was exposure to the virus from visiting live poultry markets. To date, a total of 1554 laboratory-confirmed human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported through IHR notification since early 2013.<br><br><strong> Public health response </strong><br> The Chinese government at national and local level is taking preventive measures which include:  - Continuing to guide the provinces to strengthen assessment, and prevention and control measures.  - Continuing to strengthen control measures focusing on hygienic management of live poultry markets and cross-regional transportation.  - Conducting detailed source investigations to inform effective prevention and control measures.  - Continuing to detect and treat human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) early to reduce mortality.  - Continuing to carry out risk communication and issue information notices to provide the public with guidance on self-protection.  - Strengthening virology surveillance to better understand levels of virus contamination in the environment as well as mutations, in order to provide further guidance for prevention and control.<br><br><strong> WHO risk assessment -</strong><br> The number of human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus and the geographical distribution in the 5th epidemic wave (i.e. onset since 1 Oct 2016) is greater than earlier waves. This suggests that the virus is spreading, and emphasizes that further intensive surveillance and control measures in both human and animal health sector are crucial. According to the epidemiological curve, the number of reported cases on a weekly basis seems to have peaked in early February 2017 and is slowly decreasing. The peak in cases this year 2017 corresponds to the timing of the peak in cases in previous years. Most human cases are exposed to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, and live poultry vending continues, further human cases can be expected. Additional sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) in other provinces in China that have not yet reported human cases are also expected. Similarly, sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) detected in countries bordering China would not be unexpected. Although small clusters of cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported including those involving patients in the same ward, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Therefore the likelihood of further community level spread is considered low. Close analysis of the epidemiological situation and further characterization of the most recent viruses are critical to assess associated risk and to adjust risk management measures in a timely manner.<br><br><strong> WHO advice </strong><br> WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid, if possible, poultry farms, contact with animals in live poultry markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water, and follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling in or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern. WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR 2005, and continue national health preparedness actions.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological, and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health. Continued vigilance is needed within affected and neighboring areas to detect infections in animals and humans. As the extent of virus circulation in animals is not clear, epidemiological and virological surveillance and the follow-up of suspected human cases should remain high. - Mod. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ  ", "dates": ["[3] WHO update - 19 Jul 2017", "Date: Thu 13 Jul 2017", "China reported 13 fatalities from H7N9 bird flu in June [2017] taking", "There were 108 deaths in the March to May [2017] period spurring", "in the last 2 weeks of May [2017]", "earlier this week [week of 10 Jul 2017]", "virus spiked last winter [2016-17]", "Jul 2017] that 27 cases of human [influenza] H7N9 have been reported", "China saw its biggest H7N9 outbreak over the past winter [2016-17]", "since the virus was 1st reported in China in 2013", "[2017] with 140 deaths according to the National Health and Family", "2 months of 2016 the commission said", "Between 2 and 8 Jun [2017] 12 H7N9 cases were reported in 9", "for 3 consecutive weeks the commission said last month [June 2017]", "Date: 19 Jul 2017", "On 19 Jun 2017 the National Health and Family Planning Commission of", "[Sat 24 Jun 2017] the NHFPC notified WHO of 10 additional", " On [Fri 30 Jun 2017] the", "On [Mon 19 Jun 2017] the NHFPC reported 5 laboratory-confirmed human", "dates ranged from 25 Apr 2017 to 6 Jun 2017", " The median age was 55 years (range 41 to 68 years)", "On [Sat 24 Jun 2017] the NHFPC reported 10 laboratory-confirmed human", "dates ranged from 5 to 19 Jun 2017", "5 years (range 31 to 79 years)", "reported in Inner Mongolia since the virus emerged in 2013 although 2", "A 79-year-old male who had symptom onset on [Mon 12 Jun 2017] and was", "admitted to hospital with severe pneumonia on [Thu 15 Jun 2017] then", "died on [Wed 21 Jun 2017]", "A 48-year-old male who had symptom onset on [Wed 7 Jun 2017] and was", "admitted to hospital with severe pneumonia on [Sun 11 Jun 2017]", "On [Fri 30 Jun 2017] the NHFPC reported 6 laboratory-confirmed human", "dates ranged from 11 to 23 Jun 2017", "on [Sat 17 Jun 2017] and was admitted to hospital with severe", "on [Wed 21 Jun 2017] and was hospitalized on [Sat 24 Jun 2017]", "since 1 Oct 2016) is greater than earlier waves"], "title": "Avian influenza, human (63): China, H7N9,\r\n\tWHO update "}, "158": {"sentences": " Magill Partners GeoSentinel Global TravEpiNet Mobile Apps RSS Feeds  Zika Virus in Cuba  Recommend on Facebook  Tweet  Share Compartir  Warning - Level 3, Avoid Nonessential Travel  Alert - Level 2, Practice Enhanced Precautions  Watch - Level 1, Practice Usual Precautions  Language:  Select  Espa&ntilde;ol  What is the current situation?  Zika virus (or Zika) has been reported in Cuba. Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in Cuba are infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:  Women who are pregnant:  Do not travel to Cuba.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to Cuba or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers considering pregnancy:  Before you or your partner travel, talk to your health care provider about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection.  Wait before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.  If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex &ndash; or do not have sex &ndash; for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex, or do not have sex, for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy  Talk to your health care provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you&rsquo;re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Wait at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  Men are advised to wait longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.gov  Contact CDC  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  1600 Clifton Road  Atlanta ,  GA  30329-4027  USA  800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)  Contact CDC-INFO  TOP", "dates": [" Page created: March 19 2016", " Page last updated: August 08 2017", " Page last reviewed: August 08 2017", " 30329-4027", " 800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)"], "title": ["Zika Virus in Cuba"]}, "656": {"sentences": "WHO | Kuwait  Skip to main content  Access  Home Alt+0  Navigation Alt+1  Content Alt+2  Search  Search the  WHO .

recently notified the public about a new prairie dog die-off in Concho. A previous die-off was reported in early July 2017. A notice posted on the Apache County website states: \"The Health Department has received an additional report of another prairie dog die-off in Old Concho.\" The notice bluntly states that \"Old Concho is now considered a plague-positive area.\" The die-off occurred earlier in July 2017. Fleas, and the rodents they commonly live on and feed off of, act as hosts for the life cycle of the bubonic plague bacteria, _Yersinia pestis_. Prairie dogs are quite susceptible to the disease and die quickly. Since their hosts are dead and the fleas can no longer get a meal of blood from them, the insects abandon their hosts who die deep in their burrows. They climb up and hang out near the entrance of the burrow, hoping to catch a ride and a meal on another passing animal, usually another rodent. The new area of infestation is on the opposite side of Highway 61 northwest from the original infestation. \"They both happened during the same time period. If it was the same mode of transmission, I don't know,\" said Apache County Public Health Director Chris Sexton. Sexton said he could not be sure if rodents or some other type of animal is moving the fleas around Concho. The most recent die-off occurred on vacant land in an area with a smaller number of prairie dog burrows. Sexton said it was about 300 feet about 91.5 m to the nearest residence. He did not say who reported the die-off. The property where the previous prairie dog die-off occurred was recently treated for fleas. A crew from Coconino County Public Health dusted the affected burrows with an insecticide to kill any fleas that were still alive. On 13 Jul 2017, Dr Joe Busch, a staff scientist with the Pathogen and Microbiome Institute at Northern Arizona University, took samples of fleas from burrows where the die-off occurred at the property. 10 percent of the fleas sampled tested positive for the bubonic plague bacteria. Sexton said that the burrows in the area of the most recent die-off will not be dusted because the property owners cannot be reached. He said the dusting crew must have the owner's permission before entering their property. Apache County does not conduct insecticide dusting of prairie dog burrows  they contract with Coconino County for that work. Sexton said Coconino County staffers were unable to reach the property owners. No one from Apache County has attempted to contact them, he said. Sexton was not concerned about the bacteria spreading from the untreated burrows, noting that no die-offs had been reported in Concho Valley. \"If this was something highly transmissible, like measles or flu, we would take more precautions,\" he said. The US averages about 7 cases of plague in humans annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control, although the disease did cause 4 deaths in 2015. Jeff Nafziger, an environmental health specialist with Navajo County, confirmed Tue 1 Aug 2017 that a prairie dog die-off had occurred somewhere near Taylor, but he did not give a specific location. Nafziger said the situation was under investigation and that plague bacteria had not been confirmed at that site. A crew from Northern Arizona University may take flea samples from the area for testing next week.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. It is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ ,which is mainly spread by the bites of infectious fleas. The bacterium is not native to North America. When it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations, with prairie dogs one of the main species contributing to its maintenance.

Both infections were acquired within the country  the index case from a tick bite, the other while caring for the index patient  suggesting CCHF may be spreading geographically. The case reports were published in the 13 Jul 2017 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. \"Given the expanding distribution of the main vector, the appearance of these 2 cases in a previously unaffected region of Europe reinforces the notion that CCHF is a reemerging infectious disease,\" write Jose Arribas, MD, from the Hospital Universitario La Paz in Madrid, Spain, and colleagues with the Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever at Madrid Working Group. CCHF is a viral disease spread by ticks. Humans acquire the disease through tick bites or by coming into contact with the body fluids of people or animals infected with the virus. CCHF causes severe illness, with a case-fatality rate up to 40 percent, according to the World Health Organization. Symptoms are similar to other hemorrhagic fevers, such as Ebola, and include fever, hepatitis, and blood clotting problems that can lead to hemorrhaging. Severe illness can cause multiorgan failure and death. No vaccine is currently available. CCHF has been detected in more than 30 countries in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and the southeastern part of Europe. The index case was a 62-year-old man who acquired the disease in August 2016 from a tick bite received while walking through a field in the province of Avila, in central-Western Spain. He was admitted to the hospital after 2 days of high fever, abdominal pain, malaise, nausea, and diarrhea. He was treated with doxycycline without improvement. His course was complicated by severe blood clotting problems, liver failure, kidney failure, severe respiratory insufficiency, encephalopathy, hypoglycemia, severe metabolic acidosis, and shock. On day 9, he died. During the course of his illness, tests for routine infections remained negative. CCHF virus was isolated from serum samples taken on day 6. The 2nd patient, a 50-year-old nurse, was infected with CCHF when she came into direct contact with the index patient's blood while caring for him. On day 1, she developed fever, weakness, and muscle and joint pain. On day 4, she was started on ribavirin empirically as a result of suspected CCHF. She was later transferred to the high-level isolation unit at La Paz University Hospital in Madrid. Her course was complicated by blood clotting problems, respiratory failure, increased liver enzymes, minor kidney impairment, and severe hemolytic anemia requiring blood transfusions. During the course of her illness, urine and sweat samples remained negative for CCHF. Nasal, conjunctival, and rectal swabs were weakly positive at least once during her illness. Viral titers taken from saliva, vaginal, and rectal swabs were high enough to be quantified. The CCHF virus remained detectable in her blood until day 20. A 2nd consecutive test on day 22 confirmed clearance of viral RNA from her blood. She was discharged from the hospital on day 25. The local public health service conducted contact tracing for all people exposed to either patient. Although 437 people were exposed and 386 were considered high risk for CCHF, none developed symptoms. Both patients were infected with the African 3 lineage of the virus. In Spain, this strain was first detected in 2010 in _Hyalomma lusitanicum_ ticks found 300 km away from where the index patient received his tick bite. The authors noted that CCHF was not suspected in the 2nd patient until she developed symptoms similar to the index patient. If the 2nd patient had not gotten sick, this outbreak would probably have been missed. That suggests other cases of CCHF may have occurred in Spain in recent years, but may have gone undiagnosed. \"Our observations highlight the importance of routine surveillance of vectors capable of spreading CCHF. When CCHF nucleic acid is amplified from infected ticks in geographic areas that have previously been unaffected by CCHF, clinicians should remain alert to the possibility of human cases,\" the authors conclude.<br><br><strong> Reference </strong><br> Negredo A, de la Calle-Prieto F, Palencia-Herrejon E, et al.

The City of Greater Geelong has revealed 25 Geelong Saleyards workers had shown positive results for the presence of Q fever antibodies, out of 42 tested for the condition. Despite the positive tests, the council was not aware of any workers receiving an official diagnosis to date. The zoonotic disease is transmitted from animals to humans and can cause fever, chills, headaches and muscle pain, and in rare cases long-term liver and heart problems. The Australian Services Union has hit out at the council, claiming about 50 workers had tested positive to Q fever and that workers were not being vaccinated for the disease. \"We had no idea it was this bad,\" Australian Services Union Victorian Branch secretary Richard Duffy said. \"Over 80 percent of people who have been tested have tested positive, and they've tested over 60 people now. \"There are a variety of symptoms, some people are off work, but they're continuing to test people. The more we look into it the worse it gets.\" Mr Duffy said the union was concerned by workers' claims they had not been immunised against Q fever, despite the use of vaccines being considered best practice for those working with animals. \"It turns out that nobody has been immunised against it or vaccinated against it,\" he said. \"We are seeking an urgent meeting with council to find out why.\" The bacterium that causes the Q fever can remain in the environment for a long time, is airborne and can survive disinfectants and harsh conditions. Acting city services director Peter Godfrey said the council had been testing and vaccinating staff employed at the saleyards for \"a number of years\", and played down the positive tests. \"It is possible for a person to test positive to Q fever antibodies without ever having shown symptoms of the infection, and many years after exposure to the bacteria,\" Mr Godfrey said. \"All City employees have been informed of the risks associated with exposure to Q fever at staff meetings and through an organisation-wide safety alert. \"A safety sign at the Geelong Saleyards, installed during works prior to reopening of the site in February 2017, states that Q fever vaccination is recommended for all persons attending the site.\" However the Geelong Advertiser could not find the sign when it visited the saleyards yesterday Tue 18 Jul 2017 and was later informed that the sign, which was inside the saleyards, was not \"Q fever specific\". There is no mention of Q fever or recommended vaccinations on the council's Saleyards web page, which includes advice, frequently asked questions and an Occupational Health and Safety report. A sheep and poultry sale at the Geelong Saleyards is still scheduled to go ahead on Mon 24 Jul 2017. A report into the local livestock industry by analyst Mercado, commissioned by CoGG this year 2017, found issues raised by stakeholders including \"concern for cross-contamination of airborne diseases\". Geelong Saleyards Users Group head Ian Kelly said the results weren't surprising, and that the workers could have been exposed to the disease previously. The bacterium that causes the Q fever can remain in the environment for a long time, is airborne and can survive disinfectants and harsh conditions. Farmers, abattoir workers and shearers are at the highest risk of developing the disease. Q fever is caused by a microorganism that is mainly carried by goats, sheep and cattle. It can also be carried by kangaroos, wallabies, camels, rodents, cats, dogs and birds. The bacteria can survive many disinfectants and harsh conditions. It can remain in the environment for long periods of time, which means dust, hay and other small particles may carry the bacteria. It is airborne so can be contracted by breathing in dust from infected premises and properties. Contact with the urine or faeces of infected animals and/or contaminated wool or hides can also transmit the disease. The highest risk of transmission is through contact with the birth products of infected animals. Flu-like symptoms including fever, headaches, chills and muscle pains. Only 50 percent of people who contract Q fever develop symptoms. In rare cases, long-term heart and liver problems can result. Acute cases usually require antibiotics.

The Geelong Saleyards, established in 1869 by the Geelong Town Corporation, is a venue for farmers from across the region to buy and sell sheep, cattle and poultry ( ). A truck wash also operates at the Saleyards, to clean out trucks between loads, reducing the possible spread of disease. The Saleyards was subject to a study in 2016 because of location, safety and financial concerns ( ). Although once located in an outlying area without neighboring urban uses, the Saleyards are now completely surrounded by urban development and is within close proximity to the Geelong city center. Serum antibodies to _Coxiella burnetii_, the cause of Q fever, remain detectable for years, or even for life. In the U.S., 3.1 percent of the general adult U.S. population has been found to have detectable antibodies to _C. burnetii_ ( ) and the seroprevalence in Queensland, Australia has been found to be about 5 percent in rural, as well as metropolitan (Brisbane) settings ( ). Because of persistence of a positive serology, a confirmed diagnosis of acute Q fever requires a demonstration of a 4-fold rise in phase II IgG by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) between serum samples from the acute and convalescent phases taken 3-6 weeks apart ( ). A single positive convalescent serum sample (IgG phase II greater than or equal to 1:128) in a patient who has been ill greater than 1 week indicates a probable acute infection. Serum PCR for Q fever is positive for _C. burnetii_ in almost all patients with early acute Q fever, i.e., during the 1st 2 weeks of symptoms, before the antibody response. Chronic Q Fever (i.e., endocarditis) is diagnosed by a phase I IgG antibody titer greater than 1:800). Because early doxycycline treatment (within the 1st 3 days of symptoms) is most effective, treatment of a symptomatic patient suspected of having Q fever should be based on clinical findings and should not be delayed while awaiting laboratory confirmation ( ). Treatment is not indicated for people with only positive serologic titers (although it might be considered in persons at high risk for development of chronic Q fever - see  ). In Australia, the organism is found in livestock, including goats, cattle, sheep, other farm and domestic animals, companion animals (dogs and cats) and in some wild animals (including kangaroos and bandicoots). People most at risk include workers from the meat and livestock industries and shearers, as well as the general population in close proximity to infected animals in stockyards, feedlots, processing plants or farms. In Australia, immunization is recommended for high-risk occupational groups. However, there is a risk of severe local reactions to the vaccine in those people previously exposed to Q fever or Q fever vaccine. To assess prior exposure, prevaccination serologic screening is necessary. Any positive result on screening precludes Q fever vaccination ( ). - Mod.ML   .

Heymann, Executive Director of WHO\u2019s communicable disease programmes, gives an overview of where we stand with the epidemic \u2013 what is known about this emerging disease and the unique virus that causes it, and how outbreaks in the \u201chot zones\u201d around the world are evolving. He gives a chronology of key events and explains some of the actions taken to curb further spread. He also explains why SARS poses a particularly serious threat to health, and looks at the many puzzles this unusual disease presents. Several lessons for future infectious disease emergencies, including the next influenza pandemic and a possible bioterrorist attack, are also described.

Heymann Executive Director, Communicable Diseases, WHO  Current status of the SARS outbreak At this moment, public health authorities, physicians and scientists around the world are struggling to cope with a severe and rapidly spreading new disease in humans, severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. This appears to be the first severe and easily transmissible new disease to emerge in the 21st century. Though much about the disease remains poorly understood, including the exact identity of the causative virus, we do know that it has features that allow it to spread rapidly along international air travel routes.  As of 10 April, 2781 SARS cases, with 111 deaths, have been reported to WHO from 17 countries on three continents. Some outbreaks have reassuring features. A high awareness of SARS symptoms among travellers and the medical and nursing professions has often resulted in good management of imported cases \u2013 prompt isolation of patients and management according to strict procedures of infection control. As a result, many countries having only a single or a few imported cases have experienced no further spread to hospital staff, families of patients and hospital visitors, or the community at large.  The list of countries and continents reporting suspect or probable SARS cases will no doubt continue to grow due to heightened global vigilance, knowledge about symptoms and exposures, and awareness of the need for immediate isolation of cases and strict infection control. So long as these measures are followed, the detection of first cases in countries need not be interpreted as evidence that SARS is continuing to spread. Tabular information on countries reporting SARS and the cumulative total of cases and deaths is published each day on the WHO SARS web site.  \u201cHot zones\u201d of concern Despite some positive signs that imported cases are not spreading further, outbreaks in China, Canada, Hong Kong, Hanoi, and Singapore have taken root in hospitals and beyond, and give rise to considerable concern. One of the most alarming features of SARS in these areas is its rapid spread in hospitals, where it has affected a large number of previously healthy health care workers. Many require intensive care, placing a huge strain on hospital facilities and staff. In countries, such as Canada, where cases occurred before WHO issued its global alert, SARS is continuing to spread despite the introduction of strict patient isolation and excellent infection control.  China On 9 April, a WHO investigative team, which had conducted interviews and studies in Guangdong Province since 3 April, presented its interim report on the SARS outbreak to Chinese authorities. The team concluded that the health system in Guangdong responded well to the outbreak, but that health systems in all other provinces had less capacity to cope with the severity of the challenge posed by SARS. Several recommendations for improvements were made in the report.  The team also found evidence of \u201csuper-spreaders\u201d in Guangdong, including one who is thought to have infected as many as 100 other persons. The outbreak is now thought to date back to at least 16 November, when an initial case was reported in Foshan City.  Particular concern centres on the situation in Beijing. Yesterday, WHO deepened discussions with Beijing health authorities, particularly concerning the efficiency of systems for case reporting and contact tracing.  Canada To date, Canada has reported 114 probable cases and 10 deaths. All cases have occurred in persons who have travelled to Asia or had close contact with SARS cases in households or health care facilities. Health Canada has taken several steps to protect the health of Canadians and the travelling public, and to reduce opportunities of transmitting the virus to others. Several Canadian schools and hospitals are closed.  Hong Kong Hong Kong, with 998 cases and 30 deaths, is presently the hardest hit area. Health care workers continue to become infected in a growing number of hospitals. WHO learned this week that the chief executive of the Prince of Wales Hospital \u2013 the initial epicentre of the Hong Kong outbreak \u2013 is hospitalized with atypical pneumonia. Hospitals are becoming overwhelmed. A decision to suspend all primary, secondary, special schools and kindergartens until 6 April has been extended up to 21 April.  Most disturbing is a large cluster of 268 SARS cases linked to the Amoy Gardens estate of high-rise apartment buildings. The vast majority of Amoy Gardens cases have been traced to vertically linked apartments in a single building, Block E. This pattern of transmission indicates that the disease has moved out of the health care setting and is now occurring within the community as secondary cases. Epidemiologists investigating the Amoy Gardens outbreak are considering the hypothesis that some form of environmental contamination, perhaps linked to a sewage or ventilation system, is the source of the large cluster of cases. Although transmission through the faecal-oral route is being considered as one possibility, no evidence of airborne transmission has been demonstrated to date. Virus has not been detected in animals, including cockroaches and rodents.  Yesterday, health authorities in Hong Kong announced that all household contacts of confirmed SARS patients will be required to confine themselves at home for up to 10 days with immediate effect. Household contacts can choose between confinement in their homes and confinement in holiday camps. No visitors are allowed during the confinement period, and permission to leave homes or camps will be granted only on exceptional grounds. During the confinement period, the Hong Kong Department of Health will conduct medical checks to monitor health, and the police force will conduct compliance checks.  Viet Nam In Viet Nam, an epidemiologist from the Hanoi WHO office recognized the first case of SARS on 28 February at a French hospital in Hanoi. The number of cases increased rapidly but then stabilized on 24 March at 58 cases and remained stable for 8 consecutive days. As the maximum incubation period for SARS is thought to be 10 days, the stable number of cases over this period raised hope that Viet Nam\u2019s outbreak had been brought under control. However, on 3 April a probable SARS case was detected in a provincial hospital. Though the case could be linked back to the French hospital, the absence of isolation and rigorous infection control at the provincial hospital suggests that many hospital staff, patients, and visitors may have been exposed, thus possibly seeding further waves of cases. An additional three probable cases, both known to have had close contacts with cases, have been reported since 3 April.  Singapore In Singapore, another of the earliest and hardest hit areas, 126 persons, including several children under the age of 18 years, have been diagnosed with SARS. Most disturbing are new and large clusters of suspected SARS cases among health workers, inpatients, and visitors in two interlinked wards at Singapore General Hospital and in a second hospital, Tan Tok Seng Hospital.  Intense contact tracing and investigation of these clusters increasingly points to contact with a single Chinese man in his 60s who was treated at Singapore General Hospital from 5 to 20 March for chronic kidney disease and diabetes at Singapore General Hospital. WHO epidemiologists, in collaboration with national authorities, are finding increasing evidence that the Chinese patient might have been a so-called \u201csuper-spreader.\u201d  In SARS outbreaks, a \u201csuper-spreader\u201d is a source case who has, for as yet unknown reasons, infected a large number of persons. It remains unknown whether such \u201csuper-spreaders\u201d are persons secreting an exceptionally high amount of infectious material or whether some other factor, perhaps in the environment, is working to amplify transmission at some key phase of virus shedding.  New coronavirus discovered Through new mechanisms set up by WHO, progress on the research front has been unprecedented, particularly in the rapid discovery of a new coronavirus and the rapid development of diagnostic tests. The best scientists from around the world are working on these problems around the clock, and in an unprecedented spirit of collaboration against a threat of, as yet, unknown dimensions. Nonetheless, we still do not have conclusive proof that the new virus is indeed the cause of SARS. The results of animal experiments, which are currently being conducted by a laboratory in a WHO network , will be available soon and may provide the last pieces of evidence needed for definitive proof that SARS is caused by the newly discovered coronavirus. Furthermore, the findings will provide additional evidence to understand the role of metapneumovirus as a possible \u201chelper virus\u201d in persons co-infected with the new coronavirus.  Diagnostic tests The development of a diagnostic test has proved more problematic than hoped. Three tests are now available and are helping to improve understanding of how the virus causes disease in humans. However, all three tests have limitations as tools for bringing the SARS outbreak quickly under control.  The ELISA detects antibodies reliably but only from about day 20 after the onset of clinical symptoms. It therefore cannot be used to detect cases at an early stage before they have a chance to spread the infection to others.  The second test, an immunofluorescence assay (IFA), detects antibodies reliably as of day 10 of infection, but is a comparatively slow test that requires the growth of virus in cell culture.  The presently available PCR molecular test for detection of SARS virus genetic material is useful in the early stages of infection but produces many false-negatives. This means that many persons who actually carry the virus may not be detected \u2013 creating a dangerous sense of false security for a virus that is known to spread easily in close person-to-person contact.  Present role of tests in diagnosis A positive test results indicates that a person is, or recently was, infected with the coronavirus. However, a negative test result does not guarantee that the person is not infected with the virus.  At present, reporting to WHO of probable SARS cases is based on an assessment of clinical symptoms, history \u2013 including travel history \u2013 of possible exposure to an infected person, and distinctive chest X-rays. The nine countries in the WHO laboratory network, namely Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Hong Kong SAR, the Netherlands, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America, are beginning to conduct routine laboratory testing of suspect and probable SARS cases. WHO has posted on its web site details about the test methodology that allows other countries to perform tests. However, more work is needed to produce a robust test that is capable rapidly and reliably detecting cases at an early stage of infection.  SARS response: a roll out for other emergencies caused by infectious diseases Apart from the dimensions of the SARS outbreak apparent at this date, the sections below explain why this disease poses a particularly severe threat to international health, outline the chronology of events as SARS spread around the world, and discuss lessons, based on strengths and weaknesses of the global response, for the immediate future. These lessons are of great importance.  The SARS response is the roll out of a global alert and response activity under the revision of the International Health Regulations, which provide the legal framework for the surveillance and reporting of infectious disease and for the use of measures to prevent their international spread. SARS is showing how the alert and response activity works in practice for a newly identified disease. It also indicates how the system now in operation could apply to other highly significant infectious disease events, including the next influenza pandemic, the next emerging infection, and the deliberate release of a biological agent in an act of warfare or terrorism. The scientific community is now contending with an outbreak caused by a new virus. This creates an extra step in the containment response: identification and characterization of the causative agent, which then allows development of a diagnostic test, treatment protocols, and a scientifically sound basis for recommending control measures. This is a step that would not be needed should a biological attack occur using a well-known pathogen such as anthrax or smallpox. The response to an influenza pandemic would likewise not be dealing with an entirely new and poorly understood virus.  SARS: a particularly serious threat to international health Although the last decades of the previous century witnessed the emergence of several new diseases, SARS needs to be regarded as a particularly serious threat for several reasons. If the SARS virus maintains its present pathogenicity and transmissibility, SARS could become the first severe new disease of the 21st century with global epidemic potential. As such, its clinical and epidemiological features, though poorly understood, give cause for particular alarm. With the notable exception of AIDS, most new diseases that emerged during the last two decades of the previous century or established endemicity in new geographical areas have features that limit their capacity to pose a major threat to international public health. Many (avian influenza, Nipah virus, Hendra virus, Haanta virus) failed to establish efficient human-to-human transmission. Others (Escherichia coli O157:H7, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) depend on food as a vehicle of transmission. Diseases such as West Nile Fever and Rift Valley Fever that have spread to new geographical areas require a vector as part of the transmission cycle and are associated with low mortality, often in high-risk groups, such as the elderly, the immunocompromised, or persons with co-morbidity. Still others (Neisseria meningitidis W135, and the Ebola, Marburg, and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fevers) have strong geographical foci. Although outbreaks of Ebola haemorrhagic fever have been associated with case-fatality rates in the range of 53% (Uganda) to 88% (Democratic Republic of the Congo), person-to-person transmission requires close physical exposure to infected blood and other bodily fluids. Moreover, patients suffering from this disease during the period of high infectivity are visibly very ill and too unwell to travel.  In contrast, SARS is emerging in ways that suggest great potential for rapid international spread under the favourable conditions created by a highly mobile, closely interconnected world. Anecdotal data indicate an incubation period of 2 to 10 days (average 2 to 7 days), allowing the infectious agent to be transported, unsuspected and undetected, in a symptomless air traveller from one city in the world to any other city having an international airport. Person-to-person transmission through close contact with respiratory secretions has been demonstrated. The initial symptoms are non-specific and common. The concentration of cases in previously healthy hospital staff and the proportion of patients requiring intensive care are particularly alarming. This \u201c21st century\u201d disease could have other consequences as well. Should SARS continue to spread, the global economic consequences \u2013 alreadyestimated at around US$ 30 billion \u2013 could be great in a closely interconnected and interdependent world.  Chronology of events leading to an unprecedented emergency travel advisory Severe Acute Pulmonary Syndrome (SARS) was first identified in Viet Nam on 28 February, 2003, when Dr Carlo Urbani, an epidemiologist from the Hanoi WHO office examined a patient with a severe form of pneumonia for which no etiology could be found. On 10 March 2003, 22 hospital workers in Hanoi French Hospital were ill with a similar acute respiratory syndrome, and by 11 March similar outbreaks had been reported among hospital workers in Hong Kong.  SARS occurred at a time of heightened surveillance for atypical respiratory disease. From 10 February the WHO office in Beijing, which reinforced its staff with two epidemiologists, had been working with the government of China to learn more about an outbreak of atypical respiratory disease that affected health workers, their families and contacts in Guandong Province, with 305 cases and 5 deaths reported from 16 November 2002 to 7 February 2003. Around 30% of cases were reported to occur in health care workers. Surveillance was heightened further when a 33-year-old man who had travelled with his family to Fujian Province in China died in Hong Kong on 17 February. The next day, Hong Kong authorities announced that avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, the cause of \u201cbird flu\u201d, had been isolated from both the man and his nine-year-old hospitalized son. Another member of the family, an eight-year-old daughter, died while in Fujian and was buried there.  On 12 March, after an assessment of the situation in Asia with WHO teams in Hanoi, Hong Kong and Beijing, a global alert was issued about cases of severe atypical pneumonia with unknown etiology that appeared to place health workers at high risk.  Two days later, on 14 March, WHO received a report from the government of Canada that health authorities had taken steps to alert hospital workers, ambulance services, and public health units across the provinces that there were four cases of atypical pneumonia within a single family in Toronto that had resulted in 2 deaths. At 02h00 Geneva time on the following day, 15 March, the government of Singapore notified WHO, by urgent telecommunication, of a similar illness in a 32-year-old physician who had treated hospital workers with a severe respiratory syndrome in Singapore, including one from the French Hanoi hospital who had self-evacuated to Singapore. This Singapore physician had travelled to the United States for a medical conference, and at the end of the conference boarded a return flight to Singapore in New York. Before departure he had indicated to a colleague in Singapore by telephone that he had symptoms similar to the patients he had treated in Singapore. The colleague notified health authorities. WHO identified the airline and flight, and the physician and his accompanying family members were removed from the flight at a stopover in Frankfurt, Germany, where he was immediately isolated and placed under hospital care, as were his two accompanying family members when they developed fever and respiratory symptoms several days later. As a result of this prompt action, Germany experienced no further spread linked to the three imported cases.  Later in the morning of 15 March, with this background and chronology of events, a decision was made by WHO to increase the level of the global alert issued on 12 March. The decision was based on five different but related factors. First, the etiology, and therefore the potential for continued spread, of this new disease were not yet known. Second, the outbreaks appeared to pose a great risk to health workers who managed patients, and to the family members and other close contacts of patients. Third, many different antibiotics and antivirals had been tried empirically and did not seem to have an effect. Fourth, though the numbers were initially small, a significant percentage of patients (25 of 26 hospital staff in Hanoi, and 24 of 39 hospital staff in Hong Kong) had rapidly progressed to respiratory failure, requiring intensive care and causing some deaths in previously healthy persons. Finally, the disease had moved out of its initial focus in Asia and appeared to have spread to North America and Europe.  At this time, the epidemiology of SARS was poorly understood. A virulent strain of influenza had not been ruled out as a possible cause, even though transmission patterns were not characteristic for influenza. There was also some hope that the new disease, like many other new diseases of the recent past, would fail to maintain efficient person-to-person transmission, or that it might attenuate with passage and eventually self-contain. Despite the lack of understanding about the disease, its cause, and future evolution, the need was great to introduce a series of emergency measures to contain SARS outbreaks in the affected areas and prevent further international spread, thus reducing opportunities for the new disease to establish endemicity. WHO thus decided, on 15 March, to issue a rare emergency travel advisory as a global alert to international travellers, health care professionals, and health authorities.  The global alert called for increased attention to patients with atypical pneumonia who fit the following case definition:  \u2013 High fever (>38 C) \u2013 One or more respiratory symptoms including cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing AND One or more of the following: \u2013 Close contact with a person who has been diagnosed with SARS \u2013 Recent history of travel to areas reporting cases of SARS.  At the same time the global alert recommended no change in patterns of international travel, but that passengers notify their health authority if they should develop signs and symptoms as described above and have a history of travel to areas reporting cases of SARS. Following this alert, awareness increased immediately, and many potential new outbreaks were prevented by the prompt isolation and strict management of suspected cases.  By 27 March, however, it was evident that international spread of SARS had continued after the 15 March advisory at two of the earliest outbreak sites, namely Viet Nam and Hong Kong, and that persons on the same aeroplanes as persons with symptoms consistent with SARS, and sitting in close proximity to them, had developed signs and symptoms compatible with SARS. On this date it was decided to recommend new measures related to international travel, still with the intent of preventing the international spread of the infectious agent. These recommendations were that SARS-affected areas, where transmission was known to be occurring in chains of human-to-human transmission, institute measures to identify international passengers who had signs, symptoms and history compatible with SARS, and to recommend that such persons postpone international travel and seek medical advice. These recommendations were instituted in most of the affected areas shortly after 27 March  However, concern continued to mount. An urgent investigation of the Amoy Gardens outbreak in Hong Kong began on 29 March, and the following day, health officials announced that 213 Amoy residents were probable cases of SARS. This followed an unusual cluster of cases, closely linked in time and place, among guests and visitors who had stayed on the same floor of a hotel located in the same district (Kowloon) as Amoy Gardens. By this same date, 9 business travellers and tourists had returned to Singapore, Beijing and Taiwan from Hong Kong, either sick or in the incubation period of SARS.  Outbreaks in the hotel and housing estate indicated that SARS was showing an unusual pattern of transmission in Hong Kong, probably involving an environmental component, that would place persons at risk outside the confined health care settings associated with outbreaks in most other countries. The 9 cases of probable SARS that occurred in Singapore, Beijing, and Taiwan, and that were associated with travel in Hong Kong, indicated that the risk of international spread was continuing. Consultations were made with WHO teams and travel experts. On 2 April a recommendation for voluntary postponement of all but essential travel was issued for travellers considering travel to Hong Kong. At the same time, because the WHO team and government of China had confirmed that the 4-month long outbreak in Guangdong continued, and that cases fit the case definition being applied in Viet Nam and Hong Kong; and because transmission patterns in Guangdong were not yet available, these same recommendations were made for Guangdong as maximum security against spread of SARS outside of Guangdong in the absence of complete understanding of transmission patterns of the outbreak there.  Cases of possible transmission in aeroplanes continue to be reported and investigated. As recently as 5 April, notification of a SARS patient travelling internationally by sea from Hong Kong to Vladivostak (Russian Federation) was received, opening a possible second route of international travel for the virus.  WHO travel recommendations are kept under constant review and will be amended as more data about the evolution of SARS become available.  Lessons: the value of innovation and international collaboration The knowledge obtained in the three-week period since 15 March has been remarkable. It demonstrates the value of international cooperation on emerging infections and the importance of early detection and rapid introduction of emergency measures to prevent further international spread and help ensure that imported cases are not allowed to cause disease in others.  When WHO began to set up emergency plans on 15 March, identification of the SARS causative agent and the development of a diagnostic test were given paramount importance in the overall containment strategy. Detection of the disease in its early stage, confirmation of cases, understanding modes of transmission, development of protocols for targeted treatment, vaccine research and development, and implementation of disease-specific preventive measures would all depend upon swift progress and results in etiological and diagnostic research. Sound public health measures would also require understanding of the presence and concentration of the pathogen in different tissues and secretions, and patterns of excretion throughout the course of illness and convalescence. So long as the aetiological agent remained unknown, specialists in infectious disease control would be forced to resort to control tools dating back to the \u201cMiddle Ages\u201d of microbiology: isolation and quarantine.  On 17 March, a network of 11 leading laboratories around the world was set up as a mechanism for expediting identification of the SARS causative agent. Laboratories were selected on the basis of three criteria: outstanding scientific expertise, facilities at biosafety level III, and capacity to contribute to the battery of tests and experiments that would be needed to fulfill Koch's four postulates for the identification of an infectious agent as the cause of a specific disease. The network was set up on the model of the influenza network and provides another important lesson: models and systems set up for one health emergency can be rapidly adapted to serve others.  Collaboration is virtual. Members of the network confer in daily teleconferences coordinated by WHO, and use a secure web site to post electron microscopic pictures of candidate viruses, sequences of genetic material for virus identification and characterization, descriptions of experiments, and results. The well-guarded secret techniques that give each laboratory its competitive edge have been immediately and openly shared with others. Laboratories also quickly exchange various samples from patients and postmortem tissues. These arrangements have allowed the analysis of samples from the same patient simultaneously in several laboratories specialized in different approaches, with the results shared in real time. This collaboration has resulted in the identification of the suspected causative agent, and the development of three diagnostic tests, with unprecedented speed.  Virus isolation continues from patients with SARS, and at the same time virus has been isolated from tears and faeces. Publications on these various findings are being prepared by members of this collaborating group, but the need remains for a highly sensitive and specific PCR test to diagnose acute infections.  A similar collaborative group on epidemiology, made up of investigators from all sites with local transmission of SARS, continues to confirm person-to-person transmission as the major route of transmission. Today, the group exchanged information about the Hong Kong investigations to identify a possible environmental source, which might prove useful in understanding the unusual new cluster of cases in Singapore. Key questions include the exact points during the course of incubation and infection when transmission occurs and whether asymptotic cases are also capable of spreading SARS. These questions must be answered to better evaluate the extent of spread of SARS, and the success of containment activities.  A third clinical group, which unites 80 clinicians from 13 countries having SARS cases, has consistently provided anecdotal information about the lack of efficacy of treatment with specific antibiotics and antivirals, and has begun to develop systematic clinical trials of Ribaviran at two sites. Their discussions have shed light on features of the disease at presentation, treatment and progression of the disease, prognostic indicators, and discharge criteria. No therapy has been shown to demonstrate any particular effectiveness. The clinicians agreed that a subset of SARS patients, perhaps 10%, decline, usually around day 7, and need mechanical assistance to breathe. The care of these people is often complicated by the presence of other diseases. In this group, mortality is high. Age over 40 years also appears to be associated with a more severe form of disease. Countries have made travel recommendations for their citizens, using the guidance provided by WHO and other considerations such as feasibility of medical evacuation of their citizens and their insurance coverage should they become infected.  On 28 March, at the end of the second week of the global response, China, an initially reluctant partner in the global alert and response at the start, became a full partner in the three working groups that were studying SARS, and concluded that the outbreaks of SARS elsewhere in Asia were related to the outbreak in Guangdong Province. The Chinese government has announced that SARS is being given top priority. A system of alert and response for all emerging and epidemic-prone diseases is being developed. Daily electronic reporting of new cases and deaths, by province, has begun. Equally important, health officials have begun daily televised press conferences, thus taking the important step of increasing the awareness of the population and hospital staff of the characteristic symptoms, the need to seek prompt medical attention, and the need to manage patients according to the principles of isolation and strict infection control.  The next weeks and months will tell whether the global alert and response will contain the current SARS outbreaks, preventing SARS from becoming yet another endemic infectious disease in human populations, or whether SARS will remain confined to its origins in nature, to re-emerge at yet another time and place. It is clear that the responsibility for containing the emergence of any new infectious disease showing international spread lies on all countries. In a world where all national borders are porous when confronted by a microbial threat, it is in the interest of all populations for countries to share the information they may have as soon as it is available. In so doing, they will allow both near and distant countries \u2013 all neighbours in our globalized world \u2013 to benefit from the understanding they have gained.

En los laboratorios de la cl\u00ednica comunitaria de Silom en Bangkok, se investigan los signos de resistencia al tratamiento de la gonorrea.  Silom Community Clinic/N. Tippanont  Esto podr\u00eda cambiar dentro de poco. La gonorrea est\u00e1 en la lista creciente de infecciones que pronto podr\u00edan no tener tratamiento. Los gonococos -las bacterias que provocan la infecci\u00f3n- son cada vez m\u00e1s resistentes a los antibi\u00f3ticos que anteriormente los eliminaban. La gonorrea multirresistente se ha detectado en 36 pa\u00edses.  \u00abSon ya diez los pa\u00edses que han declarado casos de gonorrea que no responden a las recomendaciones terap\u00e9uticas actuales. Puede que la gonorrea no tenga tratamiento pronto porque no se est\u00e1n desarrollando nuevas vacunas ni f\u00e1rmacos\u00bb, comenta la Dra.

Dra. Marleen Temmerman, Directora del Departamento de Salud Reproductiva e Investigaciones Conexas de la OMS  La gonorrea sin tratar puede agravarse y provocar complicaciones, como infertilidad en las mujeres, complicaciones durante el embarazo y ceguera en los beb\u00e9s que se infectan durante el parto.  Iniciativas en Tailandia  Para prevenir la propagaci\u00f3n de la gonorrea, en particular la variante farmacorresistente, es fundamental diagnosticarla y ofrecer el tratamiento adecuado lo antes posible. Sin embargo, puede haber cierta resistencia a buscar ayuda m\u00e9dica cuando hay s\u00edntomas de una enfermedad de transmisi\u00f3n sexual (ETS) como la gonorrea, por verg\u00fcenza o pudor.  Esto puede ser especialmente cierto en personas que ya se sienten marginadas, por ejemplo los hombres que tienen relaciones con otros hombres y los transexuales. Las probabilidades de que acudan a una cl\u00ednica para el seguimiento de su enfermedad son menores, por lo que es fundamental ofrecerles un tratamiento eficaz cuando van a la consulta.  Tailandia es pionera en la prestaci\u00f3n de servicios de salud no discriminatorios y en la lucha contra la gonorrea. Gracias a los enormes esfuerzos por alcanzar a personas con gonorrea, tambi\u00e9n se da la situaci\u00f3n ideal para mejorar la vigilancia: averiguar el n\u00famero de enfermos, obtener informaci\u00f3n demogr\u00e1fica y evaluar de forma adecuada el tratamiento que necesitan.  La gran importancia de la vigilancia  La OMS est\u00e1 profundamente preocupada por la gonorrea resistente a los antibi\u00f3ticos desde hace m\u00e1s de dos d\u00e9cadas. En 1992 la Organizaci\u00f3n estableci\u00f3 el Programa de vigilancia de la resistencia de los gonococos a los antimicrobianos (GASP) con objeto de efectuar un seguimiento del surgimiento y propagaci\u00f3n de la resistencia a los tratamientos contra la gonorrea, y volvi\u00f3 a activarlo en 2008.  En noviembre de 2015, el Ministerio de Salud P\u00fablica de Tailandia pondr\u00e1 en marcha una versi\u00f3n local mejorada de dicho programa con el apoyo de los Centros para el Control y la Prevenci\u00f3n de Enfermedades (CDC) de los Estados Unidos y la OMS.  \u00abEstamos impacientes por iniciar esta actividad, que ofrecer\u00e1 informaci\u00f3n fundamental sobre la gonorrea resistente a los antibi\u00f3ticos. Nos ayudar\u00e1 a garantizar que tenemos las directrices terap\u00e9uticas adecuadas y a recoger informaci\u00f3n temprana sobre gonorrea que puede ser dif\u00edcil de tratar\u00bb, comenta el Dr. Pachara Sirivongrangson, Asesor Superior sobre el VIH y otras ETS en el Departamento de Control de Enfermedades del Ministerio de Salud P\u00fablica de Tailandia.  El programa potenciar\u00e1 el sistema de vigilancia con que ya cuenta el pa\u00eds al normalizar los procedimientos de an\u00e1lisis de las muestras de gonorrea en los laboratorios y la recogida de otros datos cl\u00ednicos y demogr\u00e1ficos.  \u00abEl proyecto se ha iniciado en dos centros de Bangkok: la Cl\u00ednica comunitaria Silom @ Tropical Medicine y la cl\u00ednica de ETS en el Hospital Bangrak. Los pacientes que lleguen a las cl\u00ednicas con s\u00edntomas dejar\u00e1n una muestra para determinar si tienen gonorrea, y facilitar\u00e1n determinada informaci\u00f3n demogr\u00e1fica y conductual. Las muestras se evaluar\u00e1n para detectar si hay gonorrea y una posible farmacorresistencia\u00bb, explica la Dra. Eileen Dunne, m\u00e9dica y epidemi\u00f3loga que trabaja en la colaboraci\u00f3n entre el Ministerio de Salud P\u00fablica de Tailandia y los CDC de los Estados Unidos.  Los datos compilados en los centros iniciales, y en otros tras la ampliaci\u00f3n del proyecto, se env\u00edan al Ministerio de Salud P\u00fablica de Tailandia y se utilizar\u00e1n para ajustar las directrices nacionales de tratamiento y gesti\u00f3n de la enfermedad. Si los datos muestran que hay una resistencia elevada a un antibi\u00f3tico recomendado actualmente para el tratamiento de la gonorrea, las directrices terap\u00e9uticas se ajustar\u00e1n. Los datos permitir\u00e1n tambi\u00e9n a la OMS supervisar las tendencias mundiales y comparar la situaci\u00f3n en diferentes pa\u00edses.  Mejorar los enfoques en todo el mundo  Potenciar la vigilancia de la gonorrea es crucial porque ello sienta las bases de enfoques precisos y costoeficaces para tratar la enfermedad. Hoy en d\u00eda, muchos pacientes diagnosticados de gonorrea reciben antibi\u00f3ticos de \u00faltima opci\u00f3n que en realidad deber\u00edan mantenerse en reserva, por si la infecci\u00f3n est\u00e1 provocada por una cepa resistente a los antibi\u00f3ticos que no se curar\u00e1 con medicamentos m\u00e1s antiguos.  Los pa\u00edses con sistemas de vigilancia de la gonorrea resistente a los antibi\u00f3ticos, como los Estados Unidos de Am\u00e9rica, el Reino Unido y Australia, vigilan eficazmente las tendencias de la resistencia, lo que les ha permitido efectuar oportunamente cambios en las directrices terap\u00e9uticas. La capacidad de evaluar y recomendar el r\u00e9gimen antibi\u00f3tico m\u00e1s eficaz ha sido crucial para el control de la gonorrea en esos pa\u00edses.  La OMS ayuda a otros pa\u00edses a reforzar su vigilancia de la gonorrea resistente a los antibi\u00f3ticos, a fin de que puedan utilizar datos propios para formular directrices terap\u00e9uticas locales basadas en datos cient\u00edficos. El programa de vigilancia mejorada ofrecer\u00e1 datos demogr\u00e1ficos y cl\u00ednicos adicionales que no estaban disponibles en los programas actuales con objeto de detectar pronto la resistencia y evitar que se propague. Tailandia ser\u00e1 el primer pa\u00eds de la regi\u00f3n en efectuar un GASP mejorado, y se espera que este proyecto sirva de modelo en otros pa\u00edses.

Almost 1/3rd of the victims, 31 percent, are children younger than 5 years old. Virginia had the most confirmed cases, 52, of _Salmonella_ infections linked to backyard flocks as of 7 Jul 2017. \"In interviews, 409 (or 74 percent) of 553 ill people reported contact with live poultry in the week before illness started,\" the CDC reported on Thu 13 Jul 2017. The federal agency is now tracking 10 separate outbreaks, up from 8 reported earlier, spanning 48 states and Washington D.C., according to the Thu 13 Jul 2017 update. The CDC predicts the country is on track to surpass the 2016 total of 895 cases of _Salmonella_ infection linked to contact with backyard flocks. The implicated birds came from multiple hatcheries. No deaths have been reported, but another 103 people have required hospitalization since the CDC's initial 1 Jun 2017 public warning, bringing the total to at least 174 victims with symptoms so severe that they had to be admitted to hospitals. Information was available for only 580 of the victims, so there could have been even more hospitalizations. Multiple state agencies and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) are assisting the CDC with the outbreak investigations. \"Any live poultry can carry _Salmonella_ bacteria, even if they look healthy and clean. That's why it's important for anyone raising backyard poultry to take steps to avoid getting sick when handling and caring for birds,\" the CDC warned. As of 7 Jul 2017, the CDC had confirmed 10 strains of _Salmonella_ bacteria in the outbreak investigations: _Salmonella_ Braenderup, _S._ Enteritidis, _S._ Hadar, _S._ I 4,5,12:i-, _S._ Indiana, _S._ Infantis, _S._ Litchfield, _S._ Mbandaka, _S._ Muenchen, and _S._ Typhimurium. Illness onset dates range from 4 Jan 2017 through 20 Jun 2017. Lag time between illness onset and addition of victims to the outbreak count can be several weeks because of the time it takes for lab test results to be returned and then forwarded to state and federal officials. The outbreak numbers are expected to continue to increase for the next several months, according to the CDC, because people continue to purchase live poultry and continue to be exposed to Salmonella germs as they tend to backyard flocks. \"Regardless of where they are purchased, live poultry may have _Salmonella_ germs in their droppings and on their bodies, feathers, feet and beaks even when they appear healthy and clean. The germs can also get on cages, coops, hay, plants and soil in the area where the birds live and roam,\" the CDC reported. The following safety tips are advised by the CDC, to avoid a _Salmonella_ infection while keeping poultry: - Wash hands with soap and running water for a minimum of 20 seconds after handling live poultry; - Do not allow children younger than 5 years to handle or touch live poultry and eggs without supervision; - Never snuggle or kiss the birds or touch your face or mouth, and do not eat or drink while around live poultry. More tips for how backyard flock owners can prevent infection can be found on the CDC website. \"Young children are more likely to get sick because their immune systems are still developing and they are more likely to put their fingers or pacifiers and other items into their mouths,\" according to the CDC website. Illness from _Salmonella_ infection usually lasts 4 to 7 days, and most people recover without treatment. However, diarrhea may become so severe that the person needs to be hospitalized. \"_Salmonella_ infections are more likely to be severe for children younger than 5 years, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems, such as people with cancer, diabetes, and liver or kidney disease,\" according to the CDC.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Small animals such as chicks, ducklings, mice, and baby turtles are common vehicles for salmonellosis for 2 reasons: they are small enough to handle, and they carry salmonella. Two ways to minimize the risk: aggressive hand washing after contact and choosing other pets such as dogs or cats. - Mod.LL It has become fashionable in the US to have backyard poultry. So, this increase in human salmonellosis is not unexpected. From my personal professional epidemiological experience 50 years ago in the UK, such a rich variety of serotypes is typical of contaminated poultry feed. And with a significant suburban market for poultry feed, the quality will suffer. But the good news is that having your graduate students investigate such events is good shoe-leather experience for them, inexpensive, and they will see and learn a lot. - Mod.MHJ   .

As of Monday afternoon, 31 Jul 2017, the Nevada County Health Department had received reports of 6 children and one adult infected with or showing symptoms of _E. coli_, all of whom spent time recently at Lake Wildwood's Main Beach, according to the Nevada County Health and Human Services Agency. Four of the children were hospitalized, the agency reported. Two of them have hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a potentially life-threatening condition. One child who was hospitalized has been discharged. Symptoms of _E. coli_, which can take up to 10 days to appear after infection, include diarrhea, abdominal cramps and vomiting, according to a county press release. The lake's Main Beach and its waters remain off-limits since county officials closed the recreational area on Friday, 28 Jul 2017, following reports of the outbreak. Water samples collected that day indicated high levels of bacteria considered an indicator for _E. coli_. The county has recommended that people avoid swimming in the lake entirely until tests show its other beaches to be safe. The Nevada County Health Department and Environmental Health Department are still investigating the source of the _E. coli_. Animal feces may be responsible, the county's Health and Human Services Agency stated in a press release. County officials found no leaks from wastewater treatment facilities in the area of the lake. Ken Cutler, a Nevada County health officer, urged people to seek professional care immediately if they believe they may have _E. coli_. \"This illness is more dangerous in young children than healthy adults,\" a county press release quoted Cutler advising. \"If there are complications such as dehydration or anemia, timely treatment can make a significant difference in your recovery.\" byline: Hannah Knowles  communicated by: ProMED-mail The mentioning of hemolytic-uremic syndrome confirms the suspicion that this cluster of cases, now 7, is caused by a strain of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_. The case fatality rate for EHEC is usually below 10 per cent. There is significant evidence that the administration of most antimicrobial agents early in EHEC disease may increase the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Most fatalities are in individuals who develop central nervous system complications in HUS. Since CS Wong and colleagues reported a relative risk of the development of HUS in _E. coli_ O157 infection of 17.3 (95 per cent confidence interval 2.2 to 137) (1), it has generally been thought that antimicrobial agents increase HUS risk. In this study, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and beta-lactam drugs were those most linked to HUS. Whether other antimicrobial agents would likewise be linked to HUS, whether the same effect would occur in adults, whether non-O157 strains would behave similarly, and what the mechanism of the effect is are not clearly known. Overall, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (also referred to as cotrimoxazole) and fluoroquinolones seemed to be the prime offenders, both not uncommonly used empirically for perceived bacterial enteritis. As discussed in Kimmitt's paper in Emerging Infectious Diseases, the Shiga toxin genes reside on a lambda-like bacteriophage genome integrated into the bacterial chromosome (2). Different EHEC strains contain various numbers of these phages displaying much diversity and some being defective (3). In particular, fluoroquinolones induce high-level expression of previously silent bacteriophage genes with co-expression of the toxin genes. A number of studies have addressed Shiga toxin production and/or release using a variety of antimicrobial agents at subinhibitory and/or suprainhibitory concentrations using a variety of markers for toxin. These include direct immunologic measurement, cytotoxicity assays, and enzyme reporters. It appears that imipenem (4) and rifaximin (5) do not induce toxin production or phage-mediated cell lysis, suggesting that these agents may not increase the risk of HUS and might be useful in management. TJ Ochoa and colleagues found that fluoroquinolones induced Shiga toxin induction much more commonly in O157 than non-O157 strains (5), but Lee and Stein did not (6). References: 1.

Since the last update of 9 May 2014, there have been no new cases confirmed by ebolavirus PCR and no new deaths bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 129, including 83 deaths.  There have been no change in the number of probable cases or deaths (49 cases, 40 deaths) and suspected cases or deaths (55 cases, 34 deaths). The geographical distribution of clinical cases of EVD since the beginning of the outbreak is as follows: Conakry (50 cases, including 24 deaths), Guekedou (149/106), Macenta (23/17), Kissidougou (6/5), Dabola (4/4) and Djingaraye (1/1).  There have been no new cases of EVD in Kissidougou since 1 April, Macenta since 9 April and Conakry since 26 April. In Djingaraye and Dabola, no new cases have been reported since the end of March 2014. The cumulative total of laboratory confirmed cases and deaths since the beginning of the outbreak is: Conakry (40 cases, including 20 deaths); Guekedou (74/51); Macenta (13/10); Kissidougou (1/1); and Dabola (1/1).  The numbers of cases remain subject to change due to reclassification and consolidation of cases and laboratory data, enhanced surveillance activities and contact tracing activities. Introduction of ebolavirus serology to test PCR negative clinical cases is also likely to change the final number of laboratory confirmed cases.  Liberia and Sierra Leone  There have been no new alerts in both Liberia and Sierra Leone. Preparations to host cross- border meeting with Ivory Coast and Sierra Leone are underway.  In Liberia, upon review and consolidation of data, the cumulative number of cases is 12 (6 confirmed, 2 probable and 4 suspected). There has been no change in number of deaths (11) and date of onset of the most recent confirmed or probable case (6 April 2014).  WHO response  WHO continues to support the Ministries of Health of Guinea and Liberia in their EVD prevention and control activities. As of 7 May, 113 experts have been deployed to assist in the response. This includes 54 experts deployed through the global WHO surge mechanism, 33 international experts from among partner institutions of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), 10 externally recruited consultants, 16 WHO staff who were locally repurposed. Expertise has been mobilized in the areas of coordination, medical anthropology, clinical case management, data management and health informatics, surveillance and epidemiology, infection prevention and control, laboratory services, logistics, risk communications, social mobilization, finance and administration, and resource mobilization.  To date, 88 experts have been deployed to Guinea, 21 to Liberia, one to Sierra Leone, and three to the WHO Regional Office for Africa.  An additional, 11 deployments are in the pipeline in the disciplines of medical anthropology, clinical case management, surveillance and epidemiology, laboratory services, logistics, and risk and media communications.  WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea or Liberia based on the current information available for this event.

The 1st, during the 2010 growing season, was aimed at determining the spread of a newly discovered vitivirus, Grapevine virus E (GVE). The 2nd focused on plants showing typical grapevine leafroll disease (GLD) symptoms. In South Africa grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3 (GLRaV-3) is the virus most consistently associated with GLD. The current study determined genetic variation among GLRaV-3 isolates, as well as the relative abundance of 5 GLRaV-3 genetic variants in GLD-affected vines. In addition, the viral diversity for individual vines was determined in order to provide an overview of the most abundant viruses in vineyards from the different wine growing regions. A total of 315 plants were analysed over 2 growing seasons. 5 GLRaV-3 variants were detected as either single or mixed infections, with GLRaV-3 variant groups II and VI being the most prominent as single infections, and in combinations with each other and other variants. An analysis of the distribution of variants per region showed that single infections of variant groups II and VI occurred predominantly in certain regions and were equally distributed in red and white cultivars. Infection with variant groups II and VI were the most abundant with 49.8 and 47.6 per cent, respectively, followed by variant groups I, III, and VI. Mixed infections by 36 different virus combinations were found in 251 plants. The most abundant virus combination was GLRaV-3 with Grapevine virus E (GVE), in 28 per cent of the plants. GLRaV-3 was the predominant virus detected in the samples with a frequency of 80 per cent, followed by GVE, Grapevine rupestris stem pitting-associated virus (GRSPaV), Grapevine virus A (GVA), Grapevine virus F (GVF), Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 2 (GLRaV-2), Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 1 (GLRaV-1) and Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 4 (GLRaV-4 like). The complexity of virus populations detected highlights the need for detection methods able to identify all grapevine-infecting viruses and variants that will benefit the monitoring of disease spread and efficient management of GLD.<br><br><strong> Byline: Elize Jooste, Hano Maree, Johan Burger  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Item 1 </strong><br> The new grapevine fabavirus was initially identified by large scale sequencing (NGS) in the US from _Vitis vinifera_. Its closest relative in the genus was reported to be _Broad bean wilt virus 2_. It appears to be the 1st report of a member of the genus in grapevine. It was shown to be graft transmissible, but no association with any symptoms was reported. In a subsequent report from China, graft transmitted GFabV was associated with chlorotic mottling and leaf deformation in plants that tested positive for GFabV and negative for other viruses. In the most recent report from South Korea, symptoms such as leaf malformations, vein clearing and yellowing were reported from some GFabV infected plants, with a majority of plants remaining asymptomatic. In both China and South Korea, several _Vitis_ species and hybrids were assessed. Members of genus _Fabavirus_ (type member _Broad bean wilt virus 1_) are generally spread by aphids. Further work is needed to investigate a possible role of GFabV isolates in diseases of _Vitis_ species and a potential impact on grape production.<br><br><strong> Item 2 </strong><br> Grapevine leafroll is one of the most important viral diseases in grapevines and occurs wherever grapevines are grown. At least 9 different grapevine leafroll-associated viruses (GLRaVs) belonging to different genera within the family Closteroviridae have been reported. Typical leafroll symptoms include downward rolling and interveinal reddening or yellowing of leaves, as well as reduced fruit size, sugar content and yield. Several species of mealy bugs and soft scales (families Pseudococcidae and Coccidae, respectively) have been reported as vectors for GLRaV 3. Similar vectors are thought to be involved in the spread of some of the other GLRaVs. All of the GLRaVs are also spread by grafting and have been widely distributed and accumulated in their long-lived host over time by human activities. Symptoms of viral leafroll disease vary on different grape varieties resulting in very serious disease in some varieties and no symptoms at all in others. These latter 'latent' infections are a particular threat as a source of diseased grafting material. Generic molecular diagnostic methods for Closteroviridae have been developed and can be used to ensure virus-free rootstocks and budwood. _Grapevine virus A_ (GVA; genus _Vitivirus_) and other vitiviruses (currently including GVs A-F) are spread by grafting and similar vectors to GLRaVs. Members in the genus are implicated as causal agents of the grapevine rugose wood disease complex. An estimated yield loss of over 20 per cent has been attributed to GVA, depending on grape cultivar and location, even in asymptomatic infections. In some leafroll affected table grape cultivars, it may lead to decline and death of plants. _Grapevine rupestris stem pitting-associated virus_ (genus _Foveavirus_) has been reported in association with vitiviruses and is suspected to be involved in diseases like corky bark (ProMED-mail post http://promedmail.org/post/20150924.3669131). In South Africa, GVA as well as _Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3_ have been associated with a disease of Shiraz grapes. In long lived and graft propagated crops like grapevine, viruses and viroids can accumulate over many generations, leading to general decline of plants and severe yield reductions. Disease management of grapevine viruses may include vector control and phytosanitation, such as removal of infected plants and disinfection of vineyard tools. Use of certified virus free planting material (including tissue cultures, rootstocks, and scions for grafting) is essential.DHA ", "dates": ["Service 7/2017/123 [edited]", "Mixed infections by 36 different virus combinations were found in 251", "org/post/20150924", "3669131)"], "title": "Grapevine viruses - China, USA, South Korea, South Africa\r\n\t"}, "384": {"sentences": " Visit ProMED-mail's web site at .

Until 9 Aug 2017, a total of 20 human WNV cases with 2 deaths were reported in the same region of Argolida. IgM-capture ELISA seropositive results from horses in the area have been recently reported. >From late June 2017, dead wild birds (_Pica pica_, _Corvus corone cornix_) were reported to be found in different areas of Argolida, Peloponnese region; Aria, Inachos, Ireo and Nafplio. Until mid-July 2017, a noticeable reduction of the native wild bird population, especially Eurasian magpies, was mentioned by locals. Moreover, the presence of wild birds with neurological signs was verified near Inachos; affected birds were lethargic, unable to fly, stayed low to the ground and had no reaction to external stimuli (i.e. human presence). During the 4th week of July 2017, 20 dead Eurasian magpies were collected in a radius of 300 meters from that point near Inachos for WNV molecular detection. Tissue samples were obtained only from fresh bird corpses, and total RNA was extracted from brain and pools of liver, spleen and kidney tissue. RT-PCR was performed using different primer pairs targeting various regions of WNV genome, and viral RNA was detected in brain and tissue pools. Sequence analysis in positive samples from 2 wild birds confirmed the detection of WNV that was subsequently clustered with lineage 2 strains. These are the 1st results of an ongoing study for the surveillance of WNV in wild birds in the Peloponnese Region, while collection of more samples and efforts for recording clinical signs are continuing.

It was 1st isolated in 1937 from the blood of a febrile woman in the West Nile district of Uganda, hence the name of the virus 2. WNV is maintained in nature in an enzootic cycle involving ornithophilic mosquitoes as transmission vectors and certain birds as reservoir hosts. Spillover from this cycle occasionally results in severe outbreaks. West Nile virus has been detected in a variety of bird species. Some infected birds, especially crows and jays, are known to get sick and die from the infection. Reporting and testing of dead birds is one way to check for the presence of West Nile virus in the environment. Some surveillance programs rely on citizens to report dead bird sightings to local authorities. West Nile virus is transmitted to birds through the bite of infected mosquitoes. Mosquitoes become infected by biting infected birds. Some birds that are predators (such as hawks and owls) or scavengers (such as crows) may become infected after eating sick or dead birds that were already infected with West Nile virus. Since West Nile virus was discovered in the United States in 1999, the virus has been detected in over 300 species of dead birds. Although some infected birds, especially crows and jays, frequently die of infection, most birds survive. Wildlife agencies routinely investigate sick or dead bird events if large numbers are impacted. This type of reporting could help with the early detection of illnesses like West Nile virus or avian influenza (bird flu), known to cause deaths in birds. There is no evidence that a person can get infected from handling live or dead infected birds. However, you should avoid bare-handed contact when handling any dead animal. If you must pick up a dead bird, use gloves or an inverted plastic bag to place the bird's carcass (body) in a garbage bag 3. References: 1.

The outbreak investigation is ongoing. It has been challenging because of the long incubation period of the disease (15 to 50 days) and the difficulty experienced to contact many individuals sickened with the illness who are homeless and/or illicit drug users. To date, no common source of food, beverage, or other cause has been identified; as a result, the source of the outbreak remains undetermined. Vaccination efforts are being implemented in targeted locations by county staff and in collaboration with health care partners. Health providers are asked to inform the Epidemiology Program if they have a patient suspected to have the hepatitis A infection before the patient leaves the emergency department or provider's office. The table below will provide a weekly update of total cases, deaths, and hospitalizations.<br><br><strong> San Diego County Hepatitis A Outbreak Cases and Deaths as of 15 Aug 2017 -</strong><br> Cases / Deaths / Hospitalizations  333 / 11 (3.3%) / 232 (70%) Please note: Table does not include all reported hepatitis A cases in the county, only those that are local-outbreak-related.

Since many cases of HAV infection are asymptomatic or anicteric (without jaundice), the total number of cases is likely to have been significantly higher. It is not clear whether the newer cases are truly new or just newly reported older cases. An epidemiologic curve showing the date of onset of symptoms of cases over time could assist in this regard. Thus, it remains unclear whether the persistent increase is related to slow reporting, increased awareness and testing, secondary cases, or the persistent source or sources in the environment. The very high hospitalization rate may be related to the homelessness of the cohort but could represent a more virulent strain. HAV infection occurred in some individuals chronically infected with either hepatitis B or C, but it is not clear whether the fatalities occurred in those individuals.

All these varieties were imported from Europe within the last 4-19 years. A fragment of 431 nucleotides on the coat protein gene of _Grapevine Pinot gris virus_ was targeted for virus identification by RT-PCR. Each positive sample showed an identity of up to 99.3 per cent to the virus sequences in the NCBI database. The phylogenetic tree as well as pairwise sequence comparison showed that, although the virus sequence in each variety was unique, they all grouped with the isolates from Europe and well away from the South Korean and several Chinese isolates. This is the 1st report of the occurrence of _Grapevine Pinot gris virus_ in Australia.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. _Grapevine Pinot gris virus_ (GPGV; genus _Trichovirus_) is a newly described virus of grapevine which was identified in Italy on cv. Pinot gris vines with symptoms of chlorotic mottling and leaf deformations. It was detected by new large scale sequencing methods (\"deep sequencing\") in co-infection with several other viruses and viroids. Therefore, it was initially not possible to clearly associate the virus with specific symptoms. Amongst the grapevine viruses, GPGV appears to be most closely related to _Grapevine berry inner necrosis virus_ (GINV) of the same genus. Trichoviruses are mostly transmitted by grafting material and mechanical means, and GINV is also transmitted by a mite vector. Work is in progress to investigate symptomatology (alone and in co-infections), possible vectors, epidemiology and impact of GPGV. Disease management of grapevine viruses and viroids may include phytosanitation, such as removal of infected plants and disinfection of vineyard tools. Use of certified clean planting material (including tissue cultures, rootstocks, and scions for grafting) is essential. Previously, GPGV had been reported from Europe, North America, and Asia. The report above is its 1st report in Australasia and Oceania. Given the vegetative propagation methods used for grapevines, longevity of the host and historic international exchange of germplasm, it may be widely distributed in some or many commercial cultivars.DHA ", "dates": ["1007/s11262-017-1475-6]", "Pinot gris virus_ (_Trichovirus_ Betaflexiviridae) during 2015-2017"], "title": "Grapevine pinot gris virus - Australasia: 1st rep (Australia)\r\n\t"}, "200": {"sentences": "   Fri 18 Aug 2017 Source: SciTech Africa edited According to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization FAO, Nigeria's yam yield has presently dropped to its lowest level in 2 decades, even though the area under cultivation is rapidly rising. Nigeria accounts for 61 per cent of yam production in the world. \"Seed yam is a big problem,\" said Robert Aseidu, International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA). \"It's only now that we're seeing how big a problem this could become.\" Due to many years of flawed farm practice, most seed yams have disease.

Some scientists have seen the urgent need and high demand for disease free seed yams. Aighewi says the solution to Nigeria's seed yam crisis is large-scale aeroponic seed yam production. She also produces high-yielding and disease-resistant yam varieties. byline: Uwagbale Edward-Ekpu  communicated by: ProMED-mail Yam (_Dioscorea_ spp.) is an important tuber crop in Africa, the West Indies and parts of Asia and southern America. A number of fungal (anthracnose, leaf blight, tuber rots), bacterial (pre- and post-harvest wet rots), viral (mosaic, 'shoe-string') and nematode (dry rot) diseases or disease complexes are known to affect the crop. Many of these have been reported from West Africa, including Nigeria (see links below). For predominantly vegetatively propagated crops, including root and tuber crops like yam, potato, taro and cassava, accumulation of multiple viral and other pathogens over successive planting cycles is a high risk. Even low levels of seed tuber infections pose a major risk of both horizontal and vertical pathogen spread. A build up of both numbers and individual levels of pathogens over the planting cycles will eventually lead to weaker and weaker crops, as described above for yams. To return to viable crop production, exclusive use of planting material that was certified, preferably by molecular methods, as being free of pathogens is essential for each crop cycle. Farm saved or other uncertified propagating materials (including seeds, budwood, rootstocks, seed tubers, cuttings) have often been reported as sources of crop disease outbreaks worldwide. Clean planting stock is vital for successful agricultural systems and, consequently, certification schemes have been set up for relevant crops in many countries. In aeroponic systems, as mentioned above, plants are grown in a mist environment, without a medium to support their roots. This differs from hydroponics, where plant roots are immersed in a liquid nutrient solution. In both systems, disease (and pest) control is aided by the absence of soil and minimal requirements for handling the plants during growth.DHA ", "dates": ["Date: Fri 18 Aug 2017"], "title": "Multiple pathogens, seed yam - Nigeria "}, "33": {"sentences": "<br><br><strong> 3 Global: Global Polio Eradication Initiative, Syria, Afghanistan  Wed 16 Aug 2017 Source: Global Polio Eradication Initiative edited Poliovirus weekly update  as of 16-Aug-2017 - New wild poliovirus cases reported this week: 1 Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2017: 9 Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2016: 37 New cVDPV cases reported this week: 3 Total number of cVDPV cases in 2017: 40 Total number of cVDPV cases in 2016: 5 Headlines -</strong><br> - Marking Pakistan's Independence Day 14 August this week, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau paid tribute to both countries' ongoing collaboration, including on the effort to eradicate polio.\" Our 2 countries established a diplomatic relationship shortly after Pakistan was declared a sovereign nation in 1947. We continue to work together to advance shared priorities, including governance and democracy, regional security, poverty reduction, polio eradication, trade, defense, and the fight against climate change.\" - The 14th Emergency Committee for polio eradication under the International Health Regulations met on 3 Aug 2017 and has made its recommendations to the WHO Director-General, who has accepted them. The Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and recommended the extension of revised Temporary Recommendations for a further 3 months. The key change is the inclusion of DR Congo and Syria in the category 'States infected with cVDPV2s, with potential risk of international spread'. - Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: Afghanistan: 1 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case; Pakistan: 1 new WPV1-positive environmental sample; Syrian Arab Republic: 3 new circulating vaccine-derived polio type 2 (cVDPV2) from Syria, 2 from Deir ez-Zor and 1 from Homs governorates. Details in country-specific sections below.<br><br><strong> Afghanistan -</strong><br> - One new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week, bringing the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 to 6. It is the most recent case in the country, and had onset of paralysis on 10 Jul 2017, from Zabul province, neighbouring Kandahar province and Pakistan. - Afghanistan continues to coordinate activities with neighbouring Pakistan, to address both cross-border transmission and focus on reaching mobile populations with oral polio vaccine (OPV). Transmission linking both countries runs primarily across 3 corridors, namely: eastern Afghanistan and Khyber-Peshawar, Pakistan; greater Kandahar/Helmand and Quetta, Pakistan; and, Paktika/Patkya/Khost and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa/Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Pakistan.<br><br><strong> Pakistan </strong><br> - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week; the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 3. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 11 Jun 2017, from Killa Abdullah, Balochistan. - 1 new WPV1-positive environmental sample was reported in the past week, collected on 28 Jul 2017, from Quetta, Balochistan. - A special vaccination round is being implemented during August 2017 targeting areas with recent polio cases and positive environmental samples. These include Rawalpindi/Islamabad and demographically connected areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Quetta Block, and parts of Karachi. - Under the National Emergency Action Plan for polio eradication, the country is planning to implement 2 nation-wide and 2 sub-national vaccination rounds from September to December 2017.<br><br><strong> Nigeria -</strong><br> - No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 21 Aug 2016 in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno. - Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016). - Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance.<br><br><strong> Lake Chad Basin -</strong><br> - The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno, Nigeria in 2016) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) (Borno and Sokoto provinces in Nigeria in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak. - Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.<br><br><strong> Central Africa </strong><br> - No new cases of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). The total number of cVDPV2 cases this year 2017 remains 7, in 2 separate outbreaks: in Haut Lomami province (5 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on 13 Jun 2017); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on 26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017, with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May 2017). - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time. Outbreak response is taking place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols, targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 across the 2 provinces. - The 1st mOPV2 round was implemented on 27-29 Jun 2017 in the 2 affected provinces; and the 2nd mOPV2 round ran from 13-15 Jul 2017 in Haut Lomami and 20-22 Jul 2017 in Maniema. - Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.<br><br><strong> Middle East -</strong><br> - In Syria, 3 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were officially reported in the past week. The total number of cases in this outbreak is 33. Onset of paralysis of these cases is between 3 Mar 2017 and 10 Jul 2017. 31 of the cases are from Deir ez-Zor governorate (29 from Mayadeen district, one from Deir ez-Zor district, and one from Boukamal district); 1 case is from Talabyad district, Raqqa governorate; and, 1 is from Tadmour district in Homs governorate. - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized and implemented, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Two vaccination campaigns are planned for both Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa governorates. If there is geographic spread, the extent of these campaigns will have to be adjusted. - The 1st mOPV2 round in Deir ez-Zor was successfully carried out between 22-26 Jul 2017. Independent post-campaign monitoring reflected coverage of 88.4 percent (based on caregiver recall). The 2nd round is planned for 19-23 Aug 2017, and will include mOPV2 and IPV. - Raqqa Governorate started mOPV2 campaigns on 12 Aug 2017. - Plans are being finalized to mitigate the risks of further spread from the outbreak zone to neighbouring areas and countries, including immunization of at-risk populations in northwest Syria, Turkey and Lebanon. Following confirmation of the case in Homs, discussions are ongoing to further extend the geographic reach of the outbreak response.<br><br><strong> Officially reported wild poliovirus cases as of 15 Aug 2017 - Total global cases in 2017: 9 (compared with 21 for the same period in 2016) Total in endemic countries in 2017: 9 (compared with 21 for the same period in 2016) - Afghanistan: 6 cases in 2017 (compared with 6 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 10 Jul 2017 - Pakistan: 3 cases in 2017 (compared with 13 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 11 Jun 2017 - Nigeria: 0 cases in 2017 (compared with 2 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 21 Aug 2016 Total in non-endemic countries in 2017: 0 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016) Total global cases in 2016: 37 - Total in endemic countries: 37 - Total in non-endemic countries: 0 Officially reported cVDPV cases as of 15 Aug 2017 -</strong><br> Total global cases in 2017: 40 (compared with 3 for the same period in 2016) - Syrian Arab Republic: 33 cases in 2017 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 10 Jul 2017 - Democratic Republic of the Congo: 7 cases in 2017 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 13 Jun 2017 - Pakistan: 0 cases in 2017 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 17 Dec 2016 - Nigeria: 0 cases in 2017 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 28 Oct 2016 - Lao People's Democratic Republic: 0 case in 2017 (compared with 3 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 11 Jan 2016 Total global cases in 2016: 5 - Total in endemic countries: 2 - Total in non-endemic countries: 3  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail This week's global update is similar to prior weeks in terms of low level identification of WPV1 associated disease (a single case confirmed in Afghanistan this past week), one positive WPV1 isolated from an environmental sample in Pakistan, and 3 newly confirmed cVDPV2 associated cases in Syria. That being said, there have only been 9 confirmed cases of WPV1 associated paralytic disease worldwide this year (2017), compared with 37 cases reported last year (2016). In contrast there have been 40 confirmed cases of cVDPV2 confirmed this year (2017) compared with 5 last year (2016). As a reminder, outbreaks due to cVDPV's are considered as significant in the big picture of polio eradication, as they are due to vaccine polioviruses that have reverted in neurovirulence following passage through multiple individuals while circulating in the susceptible population. The goal of the polio eradication initiative is to interrupt transmission of both the WPV's and the cVDPVs. The presence of cVDPVs occurs when there are areas with low vaccination coverage where the vaccine virus (from the OPV) can continue circulating through the susceptible population. - Mod.MPP ",

Plant Disease 101, 1335; DOI: 10.<br><br><strong>1094/PDIS-03-17-0315-PDN </strong><br> During surveys in the northern region of Nigeria, sugarcane and itch grass (_Rottboellia cochinchinensis_) showing virus-like mosaic symptoms were encountered. Nucleic acids from symptomatic leaves from 5 randomly selected plants (sugarcane = 4; itch grass = 1) were sequenced by high-throughput sequencing (HTS). Assembly of the sequences yielded a 5566 nt long near complete (approx. 99 per cent) genome of MaYMV that was 95 to 97 per cent identical and phylogenetically related to corresponding sequences of MaYMV isolates available in GenBank. To further confirm the occurrence of this virus in source samples, individual samples were subjected to reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. The expected approx. 1100 bp DNA was amplified from 3 samples (sugarcane = 2; itch grass = 1). The fragments from one sugarcane and the itch grass sample were sequenced. They shared 99 to 100 per cent nt identity with each other and 97 to 99 per cent identity with the corresponding MaYMV sequences in this study, and those from GenBank. They also shared 86, 79, and 61 per cent nt identities, respectively, with corresponding sequences of Barley virus G tentative polerovirus, _Maize yellow dwarf virus-RMV_, and _Sugarcane yellow leaf virus_ both genus _Polerovirus_ - Mod.DHA Our results represent, to the best of our knowledge, the 1st report of MaYMV in sugarcane and itch grass worldwide. The occurrence of MaYMV in these perennial crop and weed hosts have implications for disease epidemiology since both plant species could serve as green bridges for virus perpetuation in cereal production systems.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. This novel virus, tentatively called Maize yellow mosaic virus (MaYMV; name not yet approved by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses), was described in 2016 from China (see link below). Symptoms on infected maize plants were reported as yellow mosaic on leaves. The new virus was identified by deep sequencing of small RNAs and a complete 5642 nucleotide genome was assembled. MaYMV has 73 per cent sequence identity with _Maize yellow dwarf virus-RMV_ and is considered to be a potential new member of the genus _Polerovirus_ (type member _Potato leafroll virus_), family Luteoviridae. More research is needed on its epidemiology, including potential vectors. In addition to its presence in Asia (China), South America (Ecuador, see item 1), and West Africa (Burkina Faso, Nigeria), preliminary results also suggest its occurrence in eastern Africa in Kenya, Ethiopia, Rwanda, and Sudan (unpublished, see link below) where it was reported as the most prevalent virus after _Maize chlorotic mottle virus_ (MCMV, genus _Machlomovirus_; synergistic partner in maize lethal necrosis disease, see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives and links below). Known luteoviruses are mostly important crop pathogens. Many are spread by aphids and consequently difficult to control. It appears that this potential new luteovirus may be wide spread and may pose a threat to maize production in the affected regions.DHA ", "dates": ["2044-0588", " Amplicons of 263 to 2700 bp generated were sequenced", "between the Burkina Faso isolates were 99-100 per cent", " Plant Disease 101 1335; DOI:", "1094/PDIS-03-17-0315-PDN]", " 1100 bp DNA was amplified from 3 samples", " They shared 99 to 100 per cent", "They also shared 86 79 and 61 per cent nt identities respectively"], "title": "Maize yellow mosaic virus - Africa: 1st rep (Burkina Faso,\r\n\tNigeria) new virus "}, "244": {"sentences": "   Tue 18 Jul 2017 15:26 Source: World Bulletin News edited A total of 1802 people have been killed by a cholera outbreak in war-torn Yemen since late April 2017, the WHO said Tue 18 Jul 2017. In a statement, the WHO said 356 591 suspected cases of cholera have been registered in 21 provinces across the country. The UN agency said the capital Sana'a was among the provinces hardest-hit by the disease, while the highest number of deaths was recorded in the northwestern Hajjah province. The southern province of Socotra remains the only Yemeni province where the cholera epidemic has not spread.

Reported today Tue 15 Aug 2017 in Scientific Reports by researchers from the University of Sydney, University of Melbourne and State University of New York, the study traces how pressures such as expanding human populations, urbanization and forest fragmentation altered the shape and size of the habitats of pteropid fruit bats (flying foxes) in the decades between 1980 and 2015. In recent years, bats from the Pteropodidae family have been pinpointed as 'natural reservoirs' of several emerging zoonotic viruses, such as Hendra virus (HeV), Nipah (NiV) and Ebola, which can cause death in humans. Pteropid fruit bats carry HeV without becoming ill. Research has shown the black flying fox (Pteropus alecto) and the spectacled flying fox (_Pteropus conspicillatus_) harbor the infectious HeV and can shed HeV particles in their urine. Their suitability as reservoirs has been linked to their capacity for flight, adaptability to different food sources, population structure, longevity and immune function. \"Pteropid fruit bats are essential pollinators and seed distributors in tropical and subtropical forests,\" says Dr Michael Walsh of the University of Sydney's Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity, who led the study. \"Human-caused changes in their habitat exemplify the precarious balance between ecosystem integrity and human public health. \"The opportunity for the transmission of animal-borne viruses to human populations arises when these changes in natural habitats create new configurations of ecosystems and animal populations that subsequently generate increased or unprecedented contact between human, domestic animal and wildlife communities.\" Hendra virus was 1st identified during the 1st recorded outbreak of the disease in the Brisbane suburb of Hendra, Australia, in 1994. The outbreak involved 21 stabled racehorses and 2 human cases. This newly emerging infectious disease made several further sporadic occurrences between 1994 and 2010 until in 2011 an unprecedented number of 18 distinct 'spillovers' more than doubled the number of known incidents. A spillover event is defined as transmission of a pathogen such as HeV from a reservoir such as a pteropid fruit bat to a domestic animal such as a horse. It also includes pathogen transmission from an infected domestic animal such as a horse to a human. As of August 2017, there have been 60 known outbreaks of Hendra resulting in the death of 102 horses, all occurring in the north-eastern coastal region of Australia. To date, 7 humans have contracted HeV in spillover events arising from the care or autopsy of ill or dead horses. Of those who tested positive for HeV, 4 died of the disease, including 2 veterinarians. \"The epidemiology of HeV spillover events indicates that expanding suburban communities may draw foraging flying foxes from nearby forest ranges into encroaching residential and community gardens and thereby, closer to horses,\" Dr Walsh says. The researchers did 2 sets of analyses to assess whether an expansion of the HeV reservoir was associated with an increasing trend in spillover risk. First, they modeled changes in 1713 geo-located sightings of pteropid fruit bats P. alecto and P. conspicillatus at 3 different time points between 1980 and 2015 in response to factors such as climate, topography, and human migration in the preceding decade. They found that rainfall, altitude, temperature, and human migration were highly associated with decadal changes in the ecological niche (as measured by sightings) of the black flying fox and the spectacled flying fox. \"The predicted habitat suitability for HeV reservoir pteropids expands geographically southward along the eastern coast of Australia from the earliest period in 1980-1989 to the latest in 2000-2015,\" Dr Walsh says. \"These changes predict that southeastern Queensland and northeastern NSW show consistently high habitat suitability, while advancing toward and beyond Sydney. There is also a corridor along the northern coast of the Northern Territory that shows a high degree of predicted habitat suitability.\" In their 2nd analysis, the researchers assessed whether HeV infections in horses and humans (spillover incidents) between 2000 and 2015 were associated with decadal changes in the ecological niche (as measured by sightings) of _P. alecto_ and _P. conspicillatus_ from 1980 to 2015. They found a high association between the 2, meaning the inter-decadal expanding reservoir niche of pteropid fruit bats was highly associated with a concurrent increasing trend for risk of HeV infections in humans. Furthermore, the risk of HeV infection increased threefold as the ecological niche expanded along the coast in Queensland and NSW during the 1st 2 decades under study (1980-1999) and increased further still as habitat suitability continued to change from 2000-2015. \"The shared history between HeV spillover and the ecological niche of flying foxes notwithstanding, reservoir habitat suitability alone was insufficient to describe the spatial dependence of HeV spillover,\" says Dr Walsh. \"The human footprint, proximity to woody savanna, and vegetation loss were additional components of the landscape required to adequately describe the spatial dependence of spillover across eastern Australia.\" The findings supported the researchers' hypothesis that the risk for HeV infection in Eastern Australia between 2000 and 2015 was associated with changes in the ecological niche of pteropid fruit bats in the decades between 1980 and 2015. Furthermore, this risk was highly associated with human intrusion into their habitats, human proximity to woodlands and vegetation loss.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail This would mean horse owners need to be especially wary of the equine habitat where their horses are kept. Build shelters over the water troughs and fence off the fruit trees that attract the bats. Furthermore, the likelihood of veterinarians being exposed from treating horses could mean that vaccination for the horse could become mandatory. - Mod.TG See: \"The Hendra vaccine: your questions answered\", Equine Veterinarians Australia, Australia Veterinary Association at  . - Mod.ML   .

A pneumococcal conjugate vaccine containing 7 serotypes (PCV-7) is gradually being removed from the market.  Indication and administration  Although the exact labelling details may differ by country, both PCV10 and PCV13 are licensed for immunization of infants and children from 6 weeks to 5 years of age against invasive disease, pneumonia and acute otitis media caused by the respective vaccine serotypes of S. pneumoniae . In addition, PCV13 is licensed for the prevention of pneumococcal disease in adults >50 years of age. For PCV administration to infants, WHO recommends three primary doses (given at 6, 10 and 14 weeks or 2, 4 and 6 months) or two primary doses plus a booster (given between the age of 9 and 15 months). The favourable safety and reactogenicity profiles of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines are well established, and compatibility with major childhood vaccines has been demonstrated.  Polysaccharide vaccine  The 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) represents pneumococcal serotypes that are responsible for 85\u201390% of invasive pneumococcal infections in USA and some other industrialized countries. The vaccine is efficacious against invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumonia in healthy young adults but shows limited efficacy in this regard in other age groups. PPV23 is licensed only for individuals aged >2 years. The vaccine is commonly recommended for children and adults who have certain underlying medical conditions predisposing for pneumococcal infection, although its efficacy in several of these conditions is not well documented. In some countries, such as USA, routine vaccination is recommended for everyone over 65 years of age.  For primary immunization, PPV23 is administered as a single intramuscular dose (preferably in the deltoid muscle) or as a subcutaneous dose. The optimal timing, frequency and clinical effectiveness of additional doses of PPV23 are poorly defined, and national recommendations regarding revaccination vary. However, on the basis of data on the duration of vaccine-induced protection, WHO suggests one single revaccination >5 years after a first vaccination. In resource-limited settings where there are many competing health priorities, evidence does not support routine immunization of elderly people and high-risk populations with PPV23. Local adverse reactions may be more frequent in recipients of a second dose of PPV23 but are generally self-limiting and not severe.

Rajkot chief district health officer (CDHO) Dr V H Pathak said that the man had come to the Rajkot civil hospital on Fri 21 Jul 2017 from Shivrajpur village of Jasdan with high fever. .\"His samples were sent for testing for diseases including CCHF virus.\" Pathak said that the test results, which arrived on Tue 25 Jul 2017 evening, stated that he was positive for CCHF virus. This is 1st case of the dreaded CCHF this year 2017 in Rajkot. Last year 2016 also, CCHF case was reported from Jasdan taluka of the district.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a severe viral hemorrhagic fever caused by a tick-borne virus _Nairovirus_ of the family _Bunyaviridae_ ( ). Wild and domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats are the hosts of the CCHF virus. Animals get infected by the bite of infected ticks, primarily ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_. Humans are infected by tick bites or through contact with blood or tissues of infected animals during and immediately after slaughtering. Human-to-human infection occurs when there is close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other body fluids of an infected person. Hospital-acquired infections occur through use of inadequately sterilized medical equipment, contaminated medical supplies, and reuse of needles. The incubation period is usually 1-3 days (maximum 9 days) following a tick bite and 5-6 days (maximum 13 days) for human-to-human infection. Clinical features include sudden onset of fever, myalgia (muscle ache), dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes and photophobia (sensitivity to light). Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and sore throat may also be present followed by sharp mood swings and confusion. Sleepiness, depression, lassitude, and hepatomegaly may ensue after 2-4 days. Tachycardia, lymphadenopathy, and signs of hemorrhage also appear. Severe illness leads to rapid deterioration of kidney function, sudden liver or pulmonary failure after the 5th day of the illness. CCHF has around 30 percent mortality. There is no specific treatment for CCHF. General supportive care for the symptoms is the main management. There is currently no vaccine available for human or animals. Measures to reduce the risk of tick-to-human, animal-to-human and human-to-human transmission will help in prevention and control of CCHF. The 1st cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) were reported in Gujarat state of India in January 2011, resulting in 3 deaths in confirmed and suspected cases of CCHF, which included 2 health care workers ( ). - Mod.UBA   .

Along with the Marine Water division of the DEP, they were monitoring water quality in the lagoons and found no chemicals. The conditions in the lagoons, he said, were obviously degraded and that promotes algae growth. Samples of the algae taken by the state agency are being tested, Hajna said. \"We're running tests and getting confirmation,\" he said, noting people should refrain from swimming in the lagoons, even in good conditions, because lagoon waters are often inactive and breed algae. \"People should swim on public beaches where the water is monitored and where there are lifeguards.\" No swimming is the same message Stafford Township issued to residents after becoming aware of the situation. Residents notified animal control and the mayor's office after they saw the dead ducks. The ducks appeared to be floating in the water, alive, but their heads had fallen into their chests. This set off a chain reaction for local officials, who notified the DEP's Fish and Wildlife division as well as the Ocean County Board of Health. \"We are also requesting that all residents be extremely vigilant with regard to the waterways and inform the township of any incidences of fish kills or sick birds,\" Stafford Township officials said in a statement posted to the township website late Thursday afternoon 3 Aug 2017. Anyone who comes across sick, dead, or dying wildlife should call local animal control or the health department, said Brian Lippai, public information officer for the Ocean County Board of Health. Under no circumstances should the public be handling diseased, dead, or dying animals. \"Common sense dictates that you don't approach or handle a sickly animal,\" he said, \"as much as you want to help. It creates a chain reaction.\"  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. These bacteria are widespread in soil and require warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin. There are several types of toxin produced by strains of this bacteria; birds are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent type E. Type C toxin is found in waterfowl, shorebirds, colonial waterbirds, and others; whereas type E toxin in gulls, loons, and others. - Mod.PMB   .

On Mon 14 Aug 2017 the family took him to the AKUH on the recommendation of JNH doctors, but he succumbed to the deadly infection the next day Tue 15 Aug 2017, he added. \"He offered prayers 5 times a day. N fowleri apparently infected his nervous system during ablution. We are collecting samples from his mosque and the area where he lived to analyse if the water there was chlorinated.\" Earlier this month August 2017 a woman in the city was reported to have died of the bug. According to Dr Mehdi, AS, 48, from Karimabad had died on Sun 30 Jul 2017 at a private hospital due to meningitis caused by N fowleri. He said the woman had been suffering from extreme headaches, nausea and drowsiness for some days, adding that she was taken to the Patel Hospital in Gulshan-e-Iqbal on Sat 29 Jul 2017 when her condition worsened. \"Within 24 hours of her admission to the hospital, she succumbed to the deadly infection.\" Naegleria fowleri is a pathogen found in freshwater supplied from rivers and lakes to cities. If the water is supplied unchlorinated, the bug can cause a deadly infection in the central nervous system, resulting in death in almost all the cases because so far there is no cure for it. A recent study, published in the Archives of Pharmacy Practices last year 2016, has found that the highest number of N fowleri cases was reported in 2012 when 22 people in Pakistan died of the water-borne infection. The researchers said that majority of the deaths due to the bug in the country between 2008 and 2015 occurred in the month of July. The mean temperature of the month was between 35\u00b0C 95\u00b0F and 39\u00b0C 102.2\u00b0F, while majority of the cases were reported in Karachi. They said that no individual who contracted the disease was able to survive, adding that adults between the ages of 26 and 45 years were the most affected. All of the deaths occurred in the Muslim community, concluded the study. The study also pointed out that chlorination of the municipality water supply was below the World Health Organization's recommended level of 0.5 parts per million. Byline: M.

Today\u2019s generation of youth (defined by the UN as persons aged 18 through 29) is the largest the world has ever known and as such will have a major role in shaping the world of tomorrow. To this end, youth need to be actively engaged and invited to participate in the design and development of research and programmes that affect them. This was recognised by the UN Security Council in its 2015 resolution urging Member States to increase representation of youth in decision-making at all levels. Whilst the resolution focused primarily on global security, it is equally relevant for health.

WHO/Yoshi Shimizu  Health worker provides counselling on contraceptive methods to a couple, Papua New Guinea  2 March 2017 : Since 1991, there has been mixed evidence as to whether using hormonal contraceptive methods increases a woman\u2019s risk of acquiring HIV. To answer this question the World Health Organization (WHO) has continuously monitored the available evidence. In 2016, WHO commissioned an update of a 2014 systematic review of evidence to include new studies.  The updated evidence was examined in December 2016 at a consultation that included a wide range of stakeholders including global representation from clinicians with expertise in contraception and HIV, as well as representatives from affected populations, researchers and academics, epidemiologists, programme managers, policy-makers and guideline methodologists.

The virus has so far mostly been reported in the coastal belt of the country; however, recently, some infected people travelling from Karachi brought the virus with them to the hilly areas. Recently, 3 busloads of people came to attend a wedding in the Abbasia Mohalla Bahawalpur district, Punjab. Some of the guests were carrying, apart from their luggage, the chikungunya virus, said Tehsil sub-district Headquarters (THQ) Hospital in-charge Dr Faisal Khan, while sharing details of his investigations. \"Until recently, there were no cases of chikungunya in Haripur. However, some people coming from Karachi to attend a wedding have spread the virus,\" he claimed. As a result, 2 children were infected by the virus and subsequently died, he said. The family of the deceased children were devastated, while the community is gripped by panic that the virus may spread. Over the last fortnight, a large number of people, mostly elderly and children, have been brought to district and tehsil hospitals while displaying symptoms of chikungunya, doctors confirmed. Officials stated that almost 70 percent of the population of Khoi Meera Village of Khanpur Bahawalpur had been affected by the virus, while there were widespread complaints of people suffering from high temperatures and severe body pain and headaches. Doctors at THQ Hospital were trying to convince the people, in vain, that the life span of the virus was between 5 to 7 days and that the only medication was complete bed rest, consuming lots of fresh juices, and adopting a healthy diet with painkillers. There is no commercial chikungunya vaccine, health officials said. However, residents of Khoi Meera Village and Abbasia Mohalla were running from one hospital to another seeking relief. Meanwhile, Haripur's District Health Officer Dr Mushtaq Khan Tanoli said the doctors and paramedics were trying to convince the people that the virus was not fatal. \"We have also distributed as much mosquito repellent as we could from our own resources,\" the top doctor of Haripur said, adding that the town administration too has handed out some mosquito nets while urging the public to use them. \"We have dispatched medical teams to investigate the intensity of the chikungunya outbreak in the areas surrounding Haripur. They will collect blood samples and also inform the people about the symptoms and prevention of the disease,\" Dr Tanoli said. He said that the civil administration has been urged to carry out anti-mosquito spraying and to try to drain out stagnant water to avoid spawning.

Sun 20 Aug 2017 Source: Kloop (Kyrgyzstan) in Russian, machine trans., edited At least 120 head of cattle have been killed in the Atyrau region West Kazakhstan; the cause of the death of the animals is unknown. Veterinarians do not know the cause of the animal's deaths.\"Since the cattle are still in the pastures, the owners themselves bring sick animals to us. Although they do not have a high temperature, they still cannot save them,\" said veterinarian Islamgali Mardashev. The meat of the dead cows was sent for testing in the laboratories of Astana and Almaty, but so far there are no results see comment below. It is only known that before dying the temperature of the animals rises, and there is weakness and lumps under the skin. In the summer of 2016, the Atyrau oblast similarly suffered a massive loss of livestock; more than 800 cattle died. All of them had nodular dermatitis. More than 6000 cattle were infected with the disease. byline: Alexandra Titova  communicated by: ProMED-mail From 10 to 15 Jun 2016, a disease which later was recognized as lumpy skin disease (LSD) was recorded in a cattle holding on the territory adjacent to the village of Chapayevo, West Kazakhstan (see archive no. http://promedmail.org/post/20160717.4350687; at this point in time, laymen, followed by the media, erroneously related to the undiagnosed and most probably unfamiliar new disease as foot and mouth disease.

According to the report, the susceptible population was 3557 head including 459 clinical cases of which 34 died, the 425 remaining sick animals \"killed and disposed of\". No stamping out applied and no additional case reported in the 12 follow-up reports, the last of which, no.12, submitted on 26 Nov 2017, stated: 1. Compensation to the animals' owners for dead cattle at the market price is being developed and will be implemented soon. All 459 diseased cattle heads were destroyed and the final disinfection was carried out. 2. The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted. Follow-up report no.12, with links to all previous reports, is available at  . Although according to media reports vaccination was applied, no details of such were included in the 12 follow-up reports nor in Kazakhstan's semi-annual summary report to the OIE (July-December 2016), which included the epidemiological statistics above; the item \"control measures\" (against LSD) did not include \"vaccination\". The current media report, from a Kyrgyz source (citing a Kazakh newspaper), says that during the 2016 event, 6000 animals were infected, of which 600 died. An earlier media report, from Kazakhstan, dated 27 Jul 2016, said that the number of diseased animals \"exceeded 2000, of which 50 head of cattle died\" (see archive no. http://promedmail.org/post/20160727.4374008). Kazakhstan is the world's largest landlocked country, and the 9th largest in the world. The belated diagnosis in 2016, and its continued absence, so far, during the current event, is puzzling; following the acquiring of independence in Dec 1991, Kazakhstan obtained support from the West, particularly USA, in the establishment of state-of-the-art laboratories for research and diagnosis of infectious diseases in man and animals. Early report on the factual circulation and distribution of LSD within Kazakhstan is anticipated. Neighboring countries may take steps to prevent its introduction; those countries include China, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. Russia is LSD-infected (last follow-up report addressing 2 new outbreaks in Saratov oblast, adjacent to West Kazakhstan, published 24 Aug 2017). For the diagnosis of LSD, samples from clinically affected animals should preferably be derived from their typical dermal lesions; organs from dead animals which should be sent for laboratory tests are specified in OIE's Manual. The submission of \"meat of dead cows\" for testing in the laboratories, as reported, may not be ideal for timely diagnosis of LSD. - Mod.AS   .

He said that the draft guidelines had been completed and were subject to ministerial approval. The approved guidelines would be released to the industry and public by 1 Sep 2017. \"The industry also requested to be given permission to import fertile eggs to close the supply gap as a result of culled birds.

The basic work has been conducted and there are 2 options which will be presented to the poultry industry. The 1st one is for the risk mitigation to be conducted in South Africa through stringent quarantine measures on arrival of the hatching eggs from their country of origin.\" Molapo said that the 2nd option would be for stringent quarantine measures in the country of origin where eggs will come from compartments free of specified diseases that DAFF would approve, with less stringent post arrival quarantine measures. It addresses 2 new outbreaks. In one of them, on an ostrich commercial farm in Hessequa, Western province, 22 out of a population of 1069 ostriches were clinically affected without death; culling or slaughter have not been applied.

A woman in Ashley Delaware county was hospitalized with symptoms of the mosquito-borne illness, but has been released, according to officials with the Delaware General Health District. District officials led a campaign of fogging and door-to-door notifications last week week of 17 Jul 2017. \"In rare cases, it can cause encephalitis, which is a swelling of the brain,\" said Adam Howard, environmental manager for the district. \"In less than one percent it would be fatal.\" District officials last week dropped information, screen repair kits, and mosquito repellant at doors in the neighborhood. They also urge neighbors to eliminate standing water. Mosquitoes need as little water as it takes to fill a bottle cap to breed. The breeding takes 7 days for mosquitoes to go from eggs to larva. Neighbors in Ashley said they will take more precautions after the encephalitis case last week. A resident said she will cover her children's kiddie pool more regularly. \"I bought a tarp to keep it covered hoping that will keep the mosquitoes away,\" she said. The Delaware General Health District will also offer free larvicide for neighbors with concerns about standing water on their property. Byline: Tom Bosco  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. There was a previous case reported in Ohio this year (2017) in a 4-year-old child (see La Crosse encephalitis - USA: (OH) http://promedmail.org/post/20170715.5177421). As noted in that and previous cases, the Ohio case above occurred in one of the focal La Crosse virus (LACV) endemic areas. Clinical encephalitis caused by La Crosse virus is most common in pre-school aged children, so a case in an adult is somewhat unusual. It is seldom fatal, but significant hospital stays may occur, and there may be neurological sequelae. Cases may occur earlier in the summer season than other arthropod-borne viruses because the virus can be transovarially transmitted by the infected female to her eggs, so that emerging adults may already be infected and ready to transmit the virus without the need to take an infectious blood meal from an infected forest mammal. The mosquito involved mainly is day-biting _Ochlerotatus (Aedes) triseriatus_, the reservoir of the virus maintained through transovarial transmission. LACV is a member of the California serogroup of arboviruses. There are scattered cases in other states in the eastern USA. The CDC has a good summary of LACV, its epidemiology, geographic distribution, and clinical characteristics at  .

That smell could be caused in part by an algae bloom  and the fungi are also hurting local sea lions. Residents and visitors in Pismo and Shell beaches have also seen dead fish washing up on the shore and brown water, which may also have something to do with the algae. Large algae blooms 1st appeared in California in 1991, said Clarissa Anderson, executive director of the Southern California Coastal Ocean Observing System. Then there was a lull until 1998, when Central California saw a mass blooming event that killed more than 400 sea lions. Algae blooms have appeared off the California coast every year since then. And every year, \"we've seen that the blooms are getting more and more toxins,\" Anderson said. Anderson said that her organization has been seeing a lot of algae blooms off of SLO (San Luis Obispo) County, and the forecasts for SLO County \"have been pretty hot for the last month and a half June and July 2017\" The organization uses a forecast model to monitor algae blooms off the coast of California. The forecasts are based off of a combination of satellite imagery and physical numerical weather models in the ocean. It's not an exact representation of every algae bloom, but it's a good frame of reference. Anderson said she believes that what's happening in the South County could be caused by 2 different types of algae. One of those blooms, which is called pseudo-nitzschia, contains a toxin called domoic acid. When fish like anchovies feed on pseudo-nitzschia algae, domoic acid builds up in their bodies. And when marine animals like sea lions eat the fish, the toxin poisons them and can cause brain damage, seizures, disorientation and death. In July 2017, the Sausalito-based Marine Mammal Center rescued 69 sea lions in San Luis Obispo County, with most of those coming from the Oceano area, according to Dr Shawn Johnson, the center's director of veterinary science. Johnson said they believe the sea lions suffered from exposure to domoic acid. Over the last month July 2017, most of the sea lions having been rescued were adult females who are lactating, meaning they have pups they are caring for. \"The moms go out, they fed on a bunch of fish carrying the toxin, the toxin caused them to have brain seizures and illness, which caused them to wash up on the beach where we find them,\" Johnson said. \"Unfortunately, there's a pup on the Channel Islands looking for its mom and won't find her.\" And may go hungry and die. - Mod.TG Since the beginning of the year 2017, the center has rescued 82 sea lions along the 600 miles of coastline stretching from San Luis Obispo County to Mendocino County. The center treats the sea lions who are suffering from domoic acid toxicity for weeks at a time. But not all of them make it. \"Unfortunately, by the time we rescue them, some of them consume so much of the toxin that they can't stop seizures,\" Johnson said. \"They end up dying or we end up euthanizing them because we know they have severe brain damage and are never going to recover.\" This year 2017, of the 82 rescued sea lions, 31 have died. And, according to the center's website, they are seeing an uptick in suspected domoic acid cases in San Luis Obispo County, with volunteers rescuing a high number of sea lions in the area showing signs of the toxicity. The presence of pseudo-nitzschia algae explains the sea lions. But it still doesn't account for the noxious smell. \"We don't typically smell (anything) related to (algal blooms) unless it's a really enclosed harbor,\" Anderson said, who was surprised that the smell was coming from the Pismo area and not from somewhere like Avila Beach. However, a different kind of algae bloom, called dinoflagellate algae, creates a dense bloom, Anderson said. If there are enough dinoflagellates around, people could smell the bloom as it decays. And, though it's uncommon, it's possible that fish could be consuming enough of the pseudo-nitzschia algae that they are becoming disoriented and end up washing up on the beach, Anderson said. The photo published on the original article shows fish washed up on the beach. - Mod.TG Both dinoflagellate and pseudo-nitzschia blooms, which create red tides, aren't necessarily harmful to humans. The harm comes when people eat lots of fish that may have come in contact with domoic acid, such as sardines or anchovies. The California Department of Public Health monitors commercial seafood supplies, but recreational fishers depend on state-directed quarantines, which means there's certain times of the year when people can't fish for something. But even though both types of algae blooms won't necessarily hurt people, \"when you have a lot of algal blooms along the coast, you can have a lot of bacteria in the water,\" Anderson said. \"It's common knowledge that if there's a big red tide, don't go swimming.\" By Gabby Ferreira  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. A phytoplankton, in particular a microscopic diatom _Pseudonitzschia australis_ produces the neurotoxin domoic acid (DA). DA accumulates in the hippocampus of the brain, and can cause seizures. DA accumulates in increasing amounts as it goes up the food chain. Anchovies and other prey feed on various algaes and phytoplankton. If they feed when the algae and phytoplankton are toxic, then the toxin is passed onto the California sea lion and other marine mammals when they consume the anchovies. As always, dose makes the toxin, and the effect on the sea lions depends upon the amount they consume. Diagnosis is made by the detection of DA in serum, urine or feces of the affected sea lion or marine mammal. Usually this detection is paired with finding the _Pseudonitzschia australis_ in the prey (likely an anchovie) and in environmental samples. The water soluble DA is rapidly excreted in the urine, making it a great sample for testing. However, as the algae species have variable toxicities, and DA outbreaks are unpredictable, diagnosis can be difficult to determine. - Mod.TG   .

Veterinarians in Central Kentucky have confirmed nearly 30 cases of Potomac horse fever (PHF) in area horses so far in 2017. At press time, 6 have been diagnosed since the beginning of August 2017. Most of the affected horses have been from Fayette County, with other cases being confirmed in horses from Woodford, Bourbon, Harrison, Scott, and Taylor counties. In addition to performing PCR diagnostic testing on samples from live horses, Dr. \"Typically June, July, and August are the months for the most cases of PHF, yet it can be seen throughout the spring, summer, and fall,\" Smith said. \"We average 7 cases per month during the summer for PCR testing and average 1 to 2 per summer month in necropsy.\" Dr. Bryan Waldridge of Park Equine Hospital at Woodford, in Versailles, Kentucky, who has treated many PHF cases over the years, agrees, and said he expects additional cases to be confirmed throughout August. Keeping this in mind, area owners are encouraged to watch their horses closely for signs of disease and alert veterinarians of suspicious signs as soon as possible. Smith said PHF's fatality rate ranges from 5 to 30 percent, and horses treated early in the course of disease might have a better chance of surviving. Horses don't have to live near water to contract PHF. Barn lights can attract flies, which then get into horses' water buckets, feed troughs, and hay, and subsequently into the horse. Potomac horse fever is caused by _Neorickettsia risticii_, an organism found in some flukes (a wormlike parasite) that infect aquatic snails and insects (such as caddisflies and mayflies). Horses can be exposed by inadvertently ingesting aquatic insects infected with flukes carrying the bacteria or by drinking flukes directly from rivers or streams. However, even horses residing far from water bodies aren't out of PHF's reach. \"I've seen this in racehorses, and there was a report of Potomac at a Minnesota show barn, as well,\" Waldridge said of horses contracting PHF without residing near natural water sources. \"Pole lights (near barns) or big lights on the barn will attract the flies. The flies can then get into horses' water buckets, feed troughs, and hay, and the horses can consume them that way.\" \"I've seen (PHF) on farms where the horses never drink water that doesn't come out of a spigot, and the farm I'm thinking of had the worst Potomac I've ever seen,\" he added. Also complicating diagnosis is the fact that PHF has been known to yield highly variable clinical signs. Smith said signs owners should watch for include acute onset fever, depression, decreased appetite, mild colic-like signs, watery diarrhea, edema (fluid swelling), and, later in the course of disease, acute laminitis. However, not all affected horses develop all these signs. \"The signs are so vague,\" Waldridge said. \"The 2 you hear about most are fever and going off feed  those are usually the first things you see.\" However, he said he's already had a case this year in which the horse never developed a fever. And in the past, he's had cases that have never had diarrhea. Many owners go to great lengths to protect their horses from contracting this potentially deadly disease. One option is vaccination with one of the inactivated whole-cell vaccines on the market. \"Although vaccination has been reported to protect 78 percent of experimentally infected ponies, it has been marginally protective in the field,\" said Dr. Smith. \"Vaccine failure has been attributed to antigenic and genomic heterogeneity among the more than 14 different strains isolated from naturally occurring cases. \"Furthermore, vaccine failure may also be due to lack of antibody protection at the site of exposure, because the natural route of transmission has been determined to be oral ingestion of the agent,\" she added. While some veterinarians recommend vaccinating, Dr. Waldridge said it's not one of his go-to products. \"I don't routinely recommend it,\" he said. \"I've seen horses on farms where the owners vaccinate, and those horses still get sick.\" Like Smith, he said it comes down the bacterial strain. If vaccinated horses are exposed to the specific strain in the vaccine, effective protection is more likely. If they're exposed to a different strain, it's less likely to afford protection against the disease, Waldridge said. \"It definitely appears to be a strain-related disease,\" he said. \"How lucky or unlucky you get and how sick the horse gets in the end depends on which strain ends up infecting the horse.\" Should a horse contract PHF, treatment centers around intravenous oxytetracycline administration for several days. \"If given early in the clinical course of the disease, a response to treatment is usually seen within 12 hours,\" Smith said. \"This is associated with a drop in rectal temperature, followed by an improvement in demeanor, appetite, and borborygmal (gut) sounds. \"In animals that exhibit signs of enterocolitis (inflammation of the small intestine and colon), fluids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be administered,\" she added. \"Laminitis is more common than in other causes of enterocolitis and, if it develops, is usually severe and often refractory to treatment.\" Waldridge also cautions that just because a horse's clinical signs appear to resolve initially, the situation can still take a rapid downturn. While PHF can, indeed, be challenging to prevent, owners can take steps to reduce horses' risk of consuming infected insects and snails. Chances are, Central Kentucky veterinarians will still see their share of PHF cases this year. But Waldridge said they'll face each one head-on and learn from the ones that don't end with a healthy horse. \"It's my most-hated disease,\" he said. \"Every year I swear I'm not going to let it get the best of me. There's always at least one horse a year that just tortures you  you've done everything right, and then it still gets you.\" Byline: Erica Larson  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. This disease goes by many names and can mimic conditions such as salmonellosis which can complicate the diagnosis. Potomac horse fever has several names including equine monocytic ehrlichiosis, ditch fever, Shasta River crud and equine ehrlichial colitis. You will note some of these synomyms are descriptive of the water as well as the condition. Potomac horse fever (PHF) is an acute enterocolitis syndrome producing mild colic, fever, and diarrhea in horses of all ages, as well as abortion in pregnant mares. The causative agent, _Neorickettsia risticii_ has been reported in dogs and cats; cattle appear to be resistant to infection. The clinical features of PHF are typified initially by mild depression and anorexia, followed by a fever of 102-107F (38.9-41.7C). At this stage, intestinal sounds may be decreased. Within 24-48 hr, a moderate to severe diarrhea, with feces ranging in consistency from that usually seen in cows to watery, develops in approximately 60 percent of affected horses. The onset of diarrhea is often accompanied by mild abdominal discomfort. Some horses develop severe signs of sepsis and dehydration. Clinical signs can be indistinguishable from those of Salmonella and other infectious causes of enterocolitis. Several months after clinical disease in pregnant mares, abortion due to fetal infection with _N. risticii_ may occur. Experimentally, pregnant mares infected at 100-160 days of gestation abort at 190-250 days of gestation. The abortion is accompanied by placentitis and retained placenta. Fetal lesions include colitis, periportal hepatitis, and lymphoid hyperplasia of mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen. Necropsy findings in nonpregnant horses with enterocolitis are nonspecific and reveal diffuse inflammation, mainly in the large intestines. A definitive diagnosis should be based on isolation or identification of _N. risticii_ from the blood or feces of infected horses by cell culture or PCR. Serologic testing is of limited value as a diagnostic tool. Treatment with Oxtetracycline intravenously is the recommended treatment. The article nicely described prevention of the disease, especially as it relates to lights and the attraction of the flies. Perhaps someday, we will have a better vaccine that will include the various strains and be more protective. Portions of this comment were extracted from  . - Mod.TG   .

Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world. A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases see reference below, highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries. Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years. \"Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy\", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC European Research Council-funded project which produced the article, \"but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.\" \"Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics\", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, \"and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea\". The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years 2 million DALYs since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln 13 million DALYs in the US, and 36-mln 36 million DALYs in Ethiopia. \"Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,\" continues Prof Melegaro \"our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population. Tailoring immunization campaigns to achieve measles eradication goals is essential and currently, for some countries, this means considering also the role of unprotected adolescents and young adults.

David Heaton, a spokesman for the health department, said in an email that the animals in question were \"in a contained area.\" The owners have been instructed on how to manage the animals to prevent further infection, Heaton wrote. _E. coli_ is a bacterium normally found in the intestinal tracts of animals such as cows, sheep and goats, all of which can be found in backyard pens throughout Hildale and Colorado City and Centennial Park, Ariz. A CDC webpage says that those animals can shed the bacterium in their waste and transfer _E. coli_ to humans. Contaminated food, such as undercooked ground beef or unpasteurized milk, also can spread _E. coli_. The news release from the Southwest Utah Public Health Department said water sources, ground beef, dairy products and produce in the towns all tested negative for _E. coli_.

Other animals may carry the toxigenic bacterial strains, but the more liquid nature of bovine feces (\"cow pies\") facilitates contamination of the environment and the animals themselves. Although classically associated with undercooked ground beef, the organisms can be acquired by ingestion of contaminated produce such as sprouts, salad greens and tomatoes, which can be contaminated anywhere along the food chain from the field to the kitchen. Other methods of acquisition include contamination of community water supplies as well as recreational water and direct exposure to infected animals and their environment such as in a petting zoo. It is not stated what the livestock exposure was thought to be, but some of the cases appear to be child-to-child transmission, which occurs commonly in a household or day care setting. - Mod.LL ProMED HealthMaps: Utah: Arizona:  ", "dates": [" COLI EHEC - USA (19): (UTAH ARIZONA) O157 FATALITIES SUSPECTED", "Date: Fri 28 Jul 2017", "28 Jul 2017"], "title": "E. coli EHEC - USA (19): (UT, AZ) O157, fatalities, susp.\r\n\tlivestock exposure "}, "116": {"sentences": " Magill Partners GeoSentinel Global TravEpiNet Mobile Apps RSS Feeds  Zika Virus in Singapore  Recommend on Facebook  Tweet  Share Compartir  Warning - Level 3, Avoid Nonessential Travel  Alert - Level 2, Practice Enhanced Precautions  Watch - Level 1, Practice Usual Precautions  Language:  Select  Espa&ntilde;ol  What is the current situation?  Zika virus (or Zika) has been reported in Singapore. Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in Singapore are infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:  Women who are pregnant:  Do not travel to Singapore.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to Singapore or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers considering pregnancy:  Before you or your partner travel, talk to your health care provider about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection.  Wait before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.  If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex &ndash; or do not have sex &ndash; for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More Zika information for pregnant women  2.

Travelers considering pregnancy  Talk to your health care provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you&rsquo;re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Wait at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive.

The cause of Uddanam nephropathy as it is called is still unknown. Actor and Jana Sena party chief Pawan Kalyan is himself a champion and fighter for the cause. He was the one to receive the team of scientists from Harvard who have come to Srikakulam. This is a return visit, and their research continues for a solution. They will collect samples, conduct tests, and submit their findings. Uddanam, a small village tucked into the greens of Srikakulam, is the site for a killing rampage. Uddanam nephropathy is a chronic kidney disease endemic to the place and affecting Sompeta, Kaviti, Mandasa, Icchapuram, etc. in Srikakulam district. The symptoms of the disease are: - High blood pressure - Urea deposits in kidney - Potassium accumulation in blood - Red blood cells depleted, causing anemia - Gross imbalance in body fluids Statistics: - As of 2016, 3200 have lost their lives to the mystery disease. - One in each family in Srikakulam is prey to the disease, as per numbers. - Higher chances of disease attacking the age group of 30-40 years. - More males prone to the disease than females. - The most affected are cashew nut, rice and coconut farmers in the region. Recently, the Harvard team has come again to continue research and submit findings on the disease. Andhra Medical College hosted the Uddanam Kidney Diseases Research Team along with the Health ministry and medical experts. A total of 100 000 people have been tested, and almost 26% have been detected with the disease. Out of this, 80 percent are suffering from moderate symptoms that can be cured through medical aid.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. There are numerous articles about this malady on the internet. It also appears to be occurring in other countries, and information about it can be found in the archives of ProMED-mail (see alsos below). According to:  : \"Symptoms included hypertension and diabetes, followed by a long asymptomatic period, and later diagnosed with excess proteins in the urine, decreased red blood cell count, and high levels of uric acid in the blood.\" The phenomenon was discussed and termed Uddanam nephropathy at the 2013 International Congress of Nephrology held in Hong Kong. \"Although the association of specific occupations with endemic nephropathy has highlighted the issue of environmental toxins and heat stress, the exact cause of Uddanam nephropathy is still an enigma,\" writes Anirban Ganguli of Georgetown University in the May 2016 issue of the American Journal of Kidney Disease: \"While chemical analyses of cultivated rice or drinking water from the endemic region have been negative, the concern of environmental pollution with organo-chemical pesticides and heavy metals remains, because this was not assessed in these studies,\" he adds. In 2011, a group of researchers studied the drinking water sources of these villages, and \"the presence of phenols and mercury in drinking water was found to be very high. ... Phenols and mercury, being very toxic in their characteristic nature, are bio-accumulative. Hence, these waters are found not suitable for potable purposes.\" Researchers initially pinpointed \"excessive levels of silica in water\" as the cause after a preliminary round of examination. \"According to the World Health Organization, this is one of the 3 regions in the world with the highest concentration of chronic kidney diseases (CKD) after Sri Lanka and Nicaragua.\" This disease has also been theorized to involve massive dehydration in these individuals. In several regions, there has been heavy metal testing, pesticide testing, and general toxicology screening, but thus far, there are a variety of concentrations of a variety of toxins. However, even taken in total, there does not seem to be enough to be called the actual cause of this disease. I think there have been some examinations of looking at the multiple things found in drinking waters of these various locations, as well as dehydration, but a consensus of the cause has not yet been determined. In the meantime, this is a scary and sad situation for the families involved. Men are more prone to it, as well as those who are more likely to be agricultural workers, and they are the primary providers for their families. Fathers and sons in the same family have worked in the same conditions and been equally affected. If this disease were not spread over such a large region and multiple countries one might wonder whether there is a genetic link. The vast regions of this condition may negate that theory, or their genetic link is thousands of years old and has not been discovered. We hope the researchers will quickly find the cause, treatment, and cure for this horrible situation. - Mod.TG   .

Two 5-year-old girls died on Tuesday 25 Jul 2017 at a children's hospital in Yangon, said Thinzar Aung, deputy director of the infectious diseases department at the Ministry of Health and Sport. She added that one man died on Wednesday and another on Thursday 26-27 Jul 2017 morning at other government-run hospitals in the city. Laboratory tests confirmed that all 4 people had contracted H1N1, she said. A pregnant woman and another man died on Monday 24 Jul 2017 after contracting the virus, also in Yangon. Aside from those killed by the virus, 30 people have been confirmed to have contracted the virus, Thinzar Aung said, insisting that the rising toll was not a cause for concern. Most cases have been found in Yangon, but 10 people were confirmed to have contracted the virus earlier this month July 2017 in Matupi, in the remote northwestern state of Chin. An 8-year-old boy who died in Matupi with respiratory problems is suspected to have also caught swine flu. Health officials have sought to calm fears among the public over the outbreak, which has seen stores in Yangon sell out of surgical masks. They point out that H1N1 has been among the strains of flu circulating in Myanmar seasonally since a global pandemic in 2009, although deaths from the virus have not been reported in recent years. \"We cannot say that government needs to control the spread of the virus because it is not at the level to control,\" said Thinzar Aung. \"These numbers are not big. It happens normally.\" Myanmar's health system suffered from low levels of funding under consecutive military governments that prioritized defense spending. Funding has increased since a transition from junta rule began in 2011, but the government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, which took power last year, faces a challenge to improve matters. The health ministry has called on hospitals and clinics  as well as private health facilities  to report any patients showing signs of influenza-like illness. Stephan Paul Jost, Myanmar representative for the World Health Organization, told Reuters he was \"generally impressed\" by Myanmar's initial response. \"Clearly people are alert, and referral to a hospital in the local area would be fairly quick\" under the government's surveillance system, he said. Byline: Wa Lone and Simon Lewis  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Data on the WHO Flu Net page indicate a rise in influenza A/H1N1pdm 2009 activity with nearly no cases reported in preceding weeks  ; the virus may have been in circulation with most cases mildly symptomatic and severe and fatal cases presenting within the last few days. What is important to note is that the fatal cases belong to the already described high risk groups for seasonal influenza which include: - Children younger than 5, but especially children younger than 2 years old - Adults 65 years of age and older - Pregnant women (and women up to 2 weeks postpartum) - Residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities - People who have medical conditions including: Asthma; Neurological and neurodevelopmental conditions including disorders of the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerve, and muscle such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy (seizure disorders), stroke, intellectual disability (mental retardation), moderate to severe developmental delay, muscular dystrophy, or spinal cord injury; Chronic lung disease (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD and cystic fibrosis); Heart disease (such as congenital heart disease, congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease); Blood disorders (such as sickle cell disease); Endocrine disorders (such as diabetes mellitus); Kidney disorders; Liver disorders; Metabolic disorders (such as inherited metabolic disorders and mitochondrial disorders); Weakened immune system due to disease or medication (such as people with HIV or AIDS, or cancer, or those on chronic steroids); People younger than 19 years of age who are receiving long-term aspirin therapy; People with extreme obesity (body mass index BMI of 40 or more). The CDC recommends yearly flu vaccine for everyone 6 months and older by the end of October, if possible (in these inter-seasonal cases, use of vaccination will have to be evaluated). Furthermore, prompt treatment with antiviral drugs for people who are very sick or people who are sick and at high risk of flu complications is also recommended  . - Mod.UBA   .

The small outbreak took place after the consumption of homemade smoked ham in Macedo de Cavaleiros, a town in the Bragan\u00e7a district in the northeastern region of Portugal, after a meal on 19 Jul 2017. 6 persons were exposed and 4 reported symptoms consistent with foodborne botulism. The 1st 2 patients, a middle-aged man and a pregnant woman, were admitted at Vila Real hospital. A 3rd patient, a middle-aged woman was later admitted at a hospital near Lisbon. The 4th patient, the latter's sister, was evaluated and discharged at Sao Joao Hospital Center, in Porto. All patients developed symptoms in the 1st 36 hours following ingestion, with all manifesting blurred vision, dry mouth, and dysphagia. The 3rd patient's most prominent symptoms were nausea, extreme vomiting, and constipation. The 4th patient also had prodromal diarrhea. Microbiological investigation confirmed the presence of botulinum toxin B in the stools of 3 patients and in the serum of all patients. By 4 Aug 2017, all patients had been discharged and were being followed in an outpatient setting. None required antitoxin or mechanical ventilation.  Andre Filipe dos Santos Silva Sao Joao Hospital Center Porto Portugal ProMED thanks Andre Filipe dos Santos Silva for this 1st hand posting of type B botulism.

Health officials in Italy have reported an outbreak of measles.  CDC recommends that travelers to Italy protect themselves by making sure they are vaccinated against measles. Getting measles vaccine is particularly important for infants 6&ndash;11 months of age (1 dose of measles vaccine) and children 1 year of age or older (2 doses of measles vaccine). Clinicians should keep measles in mind when treating patients with fever and rash, especially if the patient has recently traveled internationally.  What can travelers do to protect themselves?  Get measles vaccine or make sure you have already been vaccinated.  Wash your hands often.  Avoid touching your mouth, nose, and eyes.

The case is a 4-year-old boy from the district of Dogubayazit in Agri Province in the eastern part of the country. An outbreak in poultry began in the district in December 2005. The child developed symptoms on 5 January and was hospitalized on 13 January. He is being treated at a hospital in Erzurum Province.  Like the two cases confirmed on 16 January, also from Dogubayazit, exposure in this case occurred prior to the government\u2019s launch of an intensive public education campaign. Rapid surveys conducted in the most severely affected eastern part of the country have found an almost universal awareness of the disease and of the risk factors for infection. This awareness has been accompanied by behavioural changes that are expected to reduce opportunities for human infections to occur.  As the virus is now known to be present in birds in many parts of the country, some additional human cases should be anticipated in the immediate future. The number of these cases is, however, expected to decline as high-risk behaviours become less common and culling operations, which are presently under way, reduce the number of infected birds.  The newly confirmed case brings the total in Turkey to 21. Of these cases, four were fatal. All four were residents of Dogubayazit.  A second shipment of laboratory specimens arrived yesterday at a WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom. Apart from providing diagnostic confirmation, the laboratory will undertake viral characterization and genetic and antigenic analyses of viruses. These studies help determine whether the virus is evolving. Antigenic analysis of the virus helps ensure that work on the development of a pandemic vaccine stays on track. Initial results are expected later this week.

According to NIH, the objective of this advice was to sensitize human and animal health care authorities to further strengthen and improve the level of preparedness in prevention and control of CCHF. The notice, which was issued by the NIH Field Epidemiology and Disease Surveillance Division, said that the CCHF is a widespread disease caused by a tickborne virus (Nairovirus) of the Bunyaviridae family with a case fatality rate of 10 to 40 per cent. It added that the ticks, especially of the _Hyalomma_ genus, are both a reservoir and a vector for the CCHF while numerous wild and domestic animals such as cattle, buffaloes, goats and sheep are silent carriers of this virus, and the adult ticks feed on these animals. The notice said that although Balochistan remains the most affected province, cases have been reported from almost all parts of the country. During 2016, out of 101 confirmed cases, 33 patients died. During 2017, till date, a total of 41 confirmed cases have been reported including 16 from Balochistan, 15 from Punjab, 7 from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and 3 from FATA. The advisory notice said that the virus is transmitted to the people either through tick bites or through contact with the infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughtering them. Public health workers along with animal herders, veterinarians, para-veterinary staff, livestock workers, animal merchants, butchers and slaughterhouse workers are at risk of the disease. Apart from the above mentioned, people close to or taking care of a suspected patient, and individuals involved in burial practices are also at a risk of getting infected, it added. There is currently no vaccine available for humans and the only way to reduce infection is by raising awareness. The notice further added that public health advice should focus on several aspects including wearing protective clothing  such as long sleeves and trousers. People should be advised to wear light coloured clothes during a visit to the animal market to allow easy detection of ticks, and to regularly examine clothing and skin for ticks and if found, removing them safely and using approved repellents on clothing and skin. Similarly, citizens have been asked not to crush the ticks, wear gloves and other protective clothing while handling animals or their tissues, notably during slaughtering, butchering and culling procedures in slaughterhouses or at home. They have also been asked to avoid close physical contact with infected people, wearing gloves and protective equipment when taking care of them. People are also asked to wash hands frequently during caring or after visiting a patient. The notice stated that insect repellents are the most effective in warding off ticks in human populations.  communicated by: ProMED-mail The National Institute of Health Pakistan has issued this CCHF advisory notice in view of the upcoming Eid Ul Adha, when large numbers of livestock and cattle are moved from rural areas to urban markets for sale and subsequent slaughter. More spatial repellent products are becoming commercially available. These products, containing active ingredients such as metofluthrin and allethrin, augment aerosol insecticide sprays, vaporizing mats, and mosquito coils, which have been available for some time. Such products can help to clear rooms or areas of mosquitoes (spray aerosols) or repel mosquitoes from a circumscribed area (coils, spatial repellents). Although many of these products appear to have repellent or insecticidal activity under particular conditions, they have not yet been adequately evaluated in peer-reviewed studies for their efficacy in preventing vectorborne disease. Travelers should supplement the use of these products with repellent on skin or clothing and using bed nets in areas where vectorborne diseases are a risk or biting arthropods are noted  . CDC has evaluated information published in peer-reviewed scientific literature and data available from EPA to identify several types of EPA-registered products that provide repellent activity sufficient to help people reduce the bites of disease-carrying mosquitoes. Products containing the following active ingredients typically provide reasonably long-lasting protection:  - DEET (chemical name: N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide or N,N-diethyl-3-methyl-benzamide). Products containing DEET include, but are not limited to, Off!, Cutter, Sawyer, and Ultrathon.  - Picaridin (KBR 3023 Bayrepel and icaridin outside the US; chemical name: 2-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperidinecarboxylic acid 1-methylpropyl ester). Products containing picaridin include, but are not limited to, Cutter Advanced, Skin So Soft Bug Guard Plus, and Autan (outside the US).  - Oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE) or PMD (chemical name: para-menthane-3,8-diol), the synthesized version of OLE. Products containing OLE and PMD include, but are not limited to, Repel and Off ! Botanicals. This recommendation refers to EPA-registered products containing the active ingredient OLE (or PMD). \"Pure\" oil of lemon eucalyptus (essential oil not formulated as a repellent) is not recommended; it has not undergone similar, validated testing for safety and efficacy and is not registered with EPA as an insect repellent.  - IR3535 (chemical name: 3-N-butyl-N-acetyl-aminopropionic acid, ethyl ester). Products containing IR3535 include, but are not limited to, Skin So Soft Bug Guard Plus Expedition and SkinSmart.  - 2-undecanone (chemical name: methyl nonyl ketone). The product BioUD contains 2-undecanone. Published data indicate that repellent efficacy and duration of protection vary considerably among products and among mosquito and tick species. Product efficacy and duration of protection are also markedly affected by ambient temperature, level of activity, amount of perspiration, exposure to water, abrasive removal, and other factors. In general, higher concentrations of active ingredient provide longer duration of protection, regardless of the active ingredient. Products with less than 10 per cent active ingredient may offer only limited protection, often 1-2 hours. Products that offer sustained-release or controlled-release (microencapsulated) formulations, even with lower active ingredient concentrations, may provide longer protection times. Studies suggest that concentrations of DEET above approximately 50 per cent do not offer a marked increase in protection time against mosquitoes; DEET efficacy tends to plateau at a concentration of about 50 per cent. CDC recommends using products with at least 20 per cent DEET on exposed skin to reduce biting by ticks that may spread disease. DEET-containing repellents prevent both mosquito and tick bites. Health Canada recommends using a product containing no more than 10 per cent DEET for children up to 12 years of age. However, products with a DEET concentration of 10 per cent or less should not be used for exposures lasting longer than 1 h to 2 h because they may not be effective in preventing tick bites. For children over 12 years of age and adults, a repellent containing up to 30 per cent DEET can be used as recommended on the product label. In the United States, 30 per cent DEET is approved for children aged 2 months of age and older. Reapplication of DEET is indicated only if the estimated protection period has passed and a significant risk of arthropod bites remains. Adverse events from DEET are rare. Contact dermatitis and eye irritation are the commonest side effects. Toxic encephalopathy has been reported, usually with prolonged or excessive use, or occasional DEET ingestion  . Permethrin, a synthetic pyrethroid , is highly effective both as an insecticide and as a repellent. It is not licensed to be used as a topical repellent but can be sprayed on clothing (mesh jackets, hats, shoes) bed nets and camping gear to repel and kill ticks, mosquitoes and other insects. - Mod.UBA   .

Zika virus (or Zika) has been reported in Palau. Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in Palau are infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:  Women who are pregnant:  Do not travel to Palau.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to Palau or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers considering pregnancy:  Before you or your partner travel, talk to your health care provider about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection.  Wait before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.  If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex &ndash; or do not have sex &ndash; for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex, or do not have sex, for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy  Talk to your health care provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you&rsquo;re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Wait at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  Men are advised to wait longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.gov  Contact CDC  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  1600 Clifton Road  Atlanta ,  GA  30329-4027  USA  800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)  Contact CDC-INFO  TOP", "dates": [" Page created: November 16 2016", " Page last updated: August 08 2017", " Page last reviewed: August 08 2017", " 30329-4027", " 800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)"], "title": ["Zika Virus in Palau"]}, "10": {"sentences": " 2 Colorado (Larimer county)  Sat 12 Aug 2017 Source: The Prowers Journal edited A horse residing in Larimer county has been diagnosed with West Nile virus WNV; this is Colorado's 1st confirmed case of WNV in a horse in 2017. This index case was diagnosed by Colorado State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Fort Collins on 2 Aug 2017. Vaccines in horses have proven to be a very effective prevention tool. Horses having been vaccinated in past years need an annual booster shot. If an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3 to 4 week period. In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and using mosquito repellents. \"Strict insect control is an important factor to inhibit the transmission of West Nile Virus. I encourage livestock owners to keep an eye out for standing water for mosquito populations,\" said State Veterinarian, Dr Keith Roehr. Infected horses may display signs including head tilt, muscle tremors, stumbling, lack of coordination, weakness of the limbs, or partial paralysis. The clinical signs of WNV are consistent with other important neurological diseases such as equine encephalitis, rabies, and equine herpes virus; therefore it is important to work with your veterinarian to get an accurate diagnosis through laboratory testing. Horse owners should also consult their private practicing veterinarian to determine an appropriate disease prevention plan for their horses. The transmission of the disease varies from year to year and depends on a number of factors including mosquito numbers. The WNV can be amplified and carried by infected birds and then spread locally by mosquitoes that bite those birds. The mosquitoes can then pass the virus to humans and animals.

Yellow fever vaccine is safe and effective and provides immunity within one week in 95% of those vaccinated. Yellow fever control is based on the prevention of outbreaks, and this can only be achieved if the majority of the population is immunized. A two-pronged strategy is used to achieve this goal. The first strategy is the inclusion of the yellow fever vaccine in national childhood routine immunization programmes, to be administered at 9 months of age, simultaneously with the measles first dose. However, reaching the desired level of population immunity takes more than 30 years with infant routine immunization only, even with a high coverage. Therefore this strategy needs to be combined with the implementation of mass preventive vaccination campaigns to rapidly increase the population's immunity and to protect susceptible older age groups in selected high risk areas. During yellow fever epidemics, outbreak response vaccination campaigns are carried out with minimum delay in order to limit the spread of the disease.  The International Coordinating Group mechanism  In 2000, a global shortage of yellow fever vaccines for outbreak response arose from the long lead-time needed to produce the vaccine and poor surveillance and reporting which mask trends and make the forecasting of vaccine needs especially difficult. WHO and its partners in the International Coordinating Group (ICG) for Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control are applying the ICG strategy and mechanism for the release and use of yellow fever vaccine. With vaccine manufacturers as partners in the ICG, a stockpile of 2 million doses reserved for outbreak response was established. The yellow fever ICG sub-group evaluates requests for yellow fever vaccine based on agreed criteria for vaccine provision. If the criteria are fulfilled, doses are released from the stockpile for emergency control of the outbreak.  Global emergency yellow fever vaccine stockpile  The Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunization (GAVI) support  As demands for the use of the stockpile increased, a joint WHO-UNICEF proposal was successfully presented to the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunization (GAVI) Board in 2003 for financing an increased global stockpile of 6 million doses per year for a period of 3 years. In July 2005, GAVI support has been extended for an additional year until 2006.  Use of the vaccine stockpile  This mechanism will ensure that all available vaccine stocks are directed to the areas of most urgent need and that adequate supplies are manufactured and stockpiled against future outbreaks. Since the accumulation of the first stockpile in August 2003, the GAVI global vaccine stockpile has been successfully used in the outbreaks of urban yellow fever in Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Colombia, Liberia, Senegal and Sierra Leone.  C\u00f4te d'Ivoire: first yellow fever urban epidemic in over a decade  In September 2001, yellow fever cases were confirmed in five of the ten communes in Abidjan; suspected cases were also reported elsewhere. Urban yellow fever, although very rare, can spread extremely rapidly among a dense urban population, causing many thousands of deaths and very serious humanitarian consequences. Over 3.5 million people live in Abidjan \u2013 the commercial capital of Cote d\u2019Ivoire. WHO, working closely with UNICEF , coordinated the international response team with partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network ( GOARN ). An Operations Centre was established at the WHO office in Abidjan to coordinate activities in epidemiology, the immunization campaign, and vector control. Global reserve stock and delivery of vaccines and supplies were through the yellow fever sub-group of the International Coordinating Group for Emergency Vaccine Provision. Vaccines and safe injection equipment were provided. The mass campaign immunized 2.6 million persons over a 12 day period .  Colombia: an effective partnership for yellow fever vaccine supply  An outbreak of yellow fever occurred between December 2003 and January 2004 in the States of Cesar, Magdalena and La Guajira (28 cases, including 11 deaths, 39% case-fatality rate). These cases took place in the very popular tourist region of Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, with a major impact on tourism as 5 national parks were closed to visitors. This outbreak followed an outbreak of epizootic disease among monkeys in the Los Besotes natural park in Cesar State. Three million doses of yellow fever vaccine were used in the epidemic response , with the objective of providing immunization coverage for 100% of subjects aged over 1 year in urban and rural areas: 500 000 doses were donated by Venezuela, 1.5 million came from Brazil and 1 million from the GAVI global stockpile.

DEFRA UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs has upgraded the threat to the UK from 'very low' to 'low'  meaning the risk is \"rare but could occur\" (EFSA European Food Safety Authority terminology). This severe disease of pigs entered Europe through Georgia in 2007, and has since continued to the Russian Federation and eastern Europe, including EU countries in the Baltic States, Poland and very recently the Czech Republic, in wild boar. In early August 2017, an outbreak was confirmed for the 1st time in Romania among backyard pigs. African swine fever is caused by infection with ASF virus (ASFV), which can have fatality rates of up to 100 per cent. The virus causes acute disease in domestic pigs and wild boar, and may cause varying clinical signs that are similar to other pig diseases such as high fever, lethargy and loss of appetite. Pigs may also die suddenly without clinical signs. Although the virus does not cause disease in humans, the impact it has on the economy, especially through trade and farming, is substantial. As a consequence of ASF in Poland and the Baltic States the value of pork and pig exports was reduced by USD 960 million (2014-2015). In Denmark, the predicted impact of an ASF outbreak is estimated at USD 12 million in direct losses and USD 349 million in exports. Unless the appropriate control measures are put in place, additional outbreaks could occur across Europe, further into Russia and beyond to Asia. An outbreak in the UK is unlikely as imports of meat and pigs are extremely well regulated and the UK does not have a wild boar population substantial enough or widespread enough to maintain an outbreak. However, personal imports of pork products from affected areas could result in disease incursion if deliberately or accidently fed to pigs or wild boar, actions which are illegal. The seriousness of an outbreak for some countries could be far worse than others; China is home to over half the world's pig population and an outbreak of ASF could result in devastating consequences. In a Veterinary Record article see reference below world-expert on ASF Dr Linda Dixon leader of the ASF group at The Pirbright Institute, outlines the factors that increase the likelihood of ASF spreading to China and highlights areas that could be improved to reduce the risk of an outbreak including biosecurity.  communicated by: ProMED-mail Subscribers may refer to more data in the article above, addressing the following questions: - how does ASF spread? - how quickly does it spread? - how can the spread of ASFV be prevented? - what is The Pirbright Institute doing to help? The last item includes the following statement: \"The vaccine research is crucial for the prevention and control of ASF, and good progress has so far been made. An effective vaccine will enable better control and prevention measures to be put in place in the future, helping stem the losses currently being suffered by farmers around the world.\" The editorial \"Preparing for the worst: African swine fever in China\", by Linda K Dixon, was recently published in the Veterinary Record  Vet Rec. 2017; 181: 115-6, doi: 10.1136/vr.j3525.  . - Mod.AS   .

On 26 Jul 2017, the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (Taiwan CDC) announced one cluster of 3 reported meningococcal meningitis cases at a military base. 2 cases tested positive for _Neisseria meningitidis_ and one died. The test result of the other case is pending. All contacts have been evaluated by a physician and given prophylaxis. All of them have been asked to monitor their own health. As of now, no new suspected cases have been reported and the outbreak has been brought under control. On 23 Jul 2017, Taiwan CDC was notified of a suspected meningococcal meningitis case. The case was an active duty soldier at a military base in northern Taiwan. On 22 Jul 2017, when he developed symptoms, he sought immediate medical attention; the following morning, he died. On 23 Jul 2017, another hospital diagnosed the 2nd suspected case of meningococcal meningitis at the same military base. To prevent further transmission, the local health authority conducted an expanded epidemiological investigation and implemented a number of prevention measures, which identified the third suspected case, which was reported to the health authority on 24 Jul 2017. Currently, the 2 cases are stable and being treated. A total of 191 contacts, including military servicemen, family members residing in the same households, and healthcare workers, have been identified. After the physician evaluation, 118 contacts were given prophylaxis. The local health authority provided the contacts with relevant health education and asked them to monitor their own health till 12 Aug 2017. According to the surveillance data compiled by Taiwan CDC, thus far this year 2017, a total of 8 meningococcal meningitis cases, including 1 death, have been confirmed. Meningococcal meningitis is an acute infectious disease caused by meningococcus. The disease is transmitted from person-to-person through droplets of respiratory or throat secretions from carriers. The incubation period ranges from 2 to 10 days. The symptoms include fever, severe headache, nausea, vomiting, neck stiffness, hemorrhagic rash, pink spots, confusion or other mental changes, coma, and seizure. When necessary, antibiotics are prescribed as the treatment. Prompt initiation of antibiotic therapy is always necessary. Before antibiotics were available, the case fatality ratio CFR for invasive meningococcal disease was between 70 and 85 per cent. With use of antibiotics, the CFR now is 10-15 per cent, although meningococcemia is fatal in up to 40 per cent of patients ( ). - Mod.ML To ward off meningococcal meningitis, wash hands with soap and water frequently, maintain good indoor ventilation, avoid staying in poorly ventilated rooms for long hours, and seek prompt medical attention when suspected symptoms developed. Physicians are advised to be vigilant for suspected cases and prescribe antibiotics when appropriate. Travelers planning to visit areas affected by meningococcal meningitis are advised to visit the outpatient travel clinic at contracted hospitals in the nation to evaluate the need of meningococcal meningitis vaccination prior to their trip. The public is urged to seek timely medical assistance when suspected symptoms develop and inform the doctor of any recent travel history to facilitate prompt diagnosis and case reporting. For more information, please visit the Taiwan CDC website at ;  or call the toll-free Communicable Disease Reporting and Consultation Hotline, 1922 (or 0800-001922).  communicated by: ProMED-mail Close and prolonged contact (such as kissing, sneezing, and coughing on someone), living in close quarters or dormitories (military recruits, students), sharing eating or drinking utensils, etc, facilitates the spread of the disease. Close contacts of patients who have meningococcal disease are at great risk for developing meningococcal disease; the risk of secondary disease among close contacts is greatest during the first few days after the onset of disease. Spread of infection to household members and others who were directly exposed to an infected patient's oral secretions (for example, kissing, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation) is prevented by the administration to these close contacts of antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis (rifampin x 2 days, or ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, or azithromycin x a single dose), as soon as possible. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises meningococcal vaccination of the population at risk if the primary attack rate (that is, cases without known close contact with another patient with meningococcal disease) is greater than 10 cases per 100 000 population at risk. The choice of vaccine will depend on knowing the serogroup of the outbreak strain, because the quadrivalent (ACYW) meningococcal vaccine will cover serogroups A, C, Y, and W, and the serogroup B vaccine will cover only serogroup B, without cross-coverage. However, the news report above fails to provide the serogroup of the outbreak strain. - Mod.ML ", "dates": ["Date: Thu 26 Jul 2017", " On 26 Jul 2017 the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control", "On 23 Jul 2017 Taiwan CDC was notified of a suspected meningococcal", " On 22 Jul 2017 when he developed symptoms", "On 23 Jul 2017 another hospital diagnosed the 2nd suspected case of", "reported to the health authority on 24 Jul 2017", "asked them to monitor their own health till 12 Aug 2017", "this year [2017] a total of 8 meningococcal meningitis cases", "Disease Reporting and Consultation Hotline 1922 (or 0800-001922)", "patient with meningococcal disease) is greater than 10 cases per 100"], "title": "Meningitis, meningococcal - Taiwan: fatal, military base\r\n\t"}, "334": {"sentences": "   28 Jul 2017 Source: Austin-American Stateman edited There's a highly contagious strain of dog flu going around, according to KXAN. The news station reports that veterinarians are warning dog owners about H3N2, a highly contagious strain of canine influenza spreading through central Texas. Almost all dogs exposed to the virus will contract it, and 80 percent will show signs, Dr. Taia Lubitz told KXAN. Vaccinations don't completely protect dogs from H3N2, though the virus is rarely deadly. \"Signs of H3N2 are coughing, nasal discharge, decreased appetite, decreased energy, and fever in the more extreme cases. Dr. Lubitz says the dogs most vulnerable are ones that are constantly around other dogs. Avoiding places like dog parks, kennels, boarding facilities, and grooming facilities will decrease the chances of your dog getting sick.\" This isn't the 1st outbreak of the flu. It also made headlines in 2016. Find out more about the virus and what you can do to prevent it. Byline: Eric Webb  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. In the US, CI has been caused by 2 influenza strains. The 1st strain reported in the United States, beginning in 2004, was an H3N8 influenza A virus. This strain is closely related to the virus that causes equine influenza, and it is thought that the equine influenza virus mutated to produce the canine strain. In 2015, an outbreak that started in Chicago was caused by a separate CI virus, H3N2. The strain causing the 2015 outbreak was almost genetically identical to an H3N2 strain previously reported only in Asia  specifically, Korea, China, and Thailand. In Asia, this H3N2 strain is believed to have resulted from the direct transfer of an avian influenza virus  possibly from among viruses circulating in live bird markets  to dogs. Since March 2015, thousands of dogs have been confirmed positive for H3N2 CI across the US.\" ( ) Healthy dogs can be vaccinated and should be if you must board your animal.

According to the Indo-American study, Punjab, famous for its large and crowded poultry farms, may be sprouting \"superbugs\" or bacteria that are resistant to routine antibiotics. The study reports high prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria detected in poultry farms in Punjab and warns of potentially disastrous consequences on human health due to use of growth-promoting antibiotics in animal farming. \"The world is on the brink of losing these miracle cures,\" said recently retired WHO Director-General Margaret Chan, referring to antibiotics that were hailed as \"wonder drugs.\" Crowded poultry farms could be breeding superbugs in Punjab, finds the new study. Next time you get an infection that is hard to cure by routine antibiotics, a phenomenon ominously called the emergence of superbugs, one may want to blame the poultry farms, especially from Punjab, where, experts say, use of antibiotics is rampant for rapidly fattening chickens. Poultry farms are deploying antibiotics not to treat sick animals, but to fatten them quickly. The study led by researchers from the Centre for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy (CDDEP), Washington DC, published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives, finds high levels of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in chickens raised for both meat and eggs on farms in Punjab 1. The study raises serious concerns over the use of antibiotics for growth promotion in farm animals. \"Overuse of antibiotics in animal farms endangers us all as it multiplies drug resistance in the environment,\" said study author and CDDEP Director Ramanan Laxminarayan. \"Punjab is one of the leading states in India in poultry farming. It is critical that we take measures to end the use of antibiotics for growth promotion in animal breeding practices.\" According to the WHO, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) threatens the effective prevention and treatment of an ever-increasing range of infections caused by bacteria, parasites, viruses and fungi. The Punjab poultry farm survey is the largest study of its kind looking at sources of AMR ever to be conducted in India. Researchers collected more than 1500 samples from 530 birds at 18 poultry farms in 6 districts of Punjab and tested these for resistance to a range of antibiotics. 2/3rds of the farms reported using antibiotics for growth promotion; these farms were also nearly 3 times more likely to report multi-drug resistant bacteria than those that did not use antibiotics for growth promotion. \"AMR has huge implications for India,\" says Dr Henk Bekedam, WHO representative in India. Unfortunately, some of the blame falls on the lifeless but tasty tandoori chicken. 1. Brower CH, Manda S, Hayer S, et al. The Prevalence of Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase-Producing Multidrug-Resistant _Escherichia Coli_ in Poultry Chickens and Variation According to Farming Practices in Punjab, India. Environmental Health Perspectives. July 2017; 125(7). Available online at:  .  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. In India, the use of antimicrobials in food animal production is unregulated. Research suggests that many clinically important antimicrobials are used indiscriminately. This is the largest study to date in India that surveys poultry production to test for antimicrobial resistance and the occurrence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) modulated by farming and managerial practices. \"OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to survey poultry production for resistance to 11 clinically relevant antimicrobials and phenotypic occurrence of ESBLs as modulated by farming and managerial practices. \"METHODS: Eighteen poultry farms from Punjab were surveyed, and 1,556 _Escherichia coli_ isolates from 530 birds were tested for susceptibility to 11 antimicrobials using the disk diffusion method and validated using VITEK 2 (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy-L'\u00c9toile, France). Samples from 510 of these birds were phenotypically tested for ESBL production using the combination disk method and confirmed using VITEK 2. Generalized linear mixed models were used to infer differences in resistance profiles associated with different farming practices and facility types. \"RESULTS: Resistance profiles were significantly different between broiler and layer farms. Broiler farms were 2.2 ampicillin (AMP), p = 0:017 to 23 nalidixic acid (NX), p under 0:001 times more likely to harbor resistant _E. coli_ strains than layer farms. Adjusting for farm type (broiler vs. layer), the odds of resistance (although not statistically significant) to all antimicrobials except nitrofurantoin (NIT) were higher in independent facilities (IUs) as compared to contracted facilities (CFs). Increased prevalence of multidrug resistance (MDR; 94% compared to 60% in layers), including prevalence of ESBL-producing strains (87% compared to 42% in layers), was observed in broiler farms. \"CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that unregulated use of clinically relevant antimicrobials in Indian broiler and layer farms may contribute to the emergence of resistance and support the need to curb the nontherapeutic use of medically important antimicrobials in food animal production.\" Prior ProMED-mail posts have reported on the high rates of antimicrobial resistance in both human populations and the environment in India (see ProMED-mail posts Antibiotic resistance (04): India, China, environmental pollution http://promedmail.org/post/20161020.4574059, Antibiotic resistance (03): India (TG) environmental pollution http://promedmail.org/post/20161010.4548738, and Antibiotic resistance - India: (Delhi) E. coli, MDR, river water pollution http://promedmail.org/post/20151209.3850743). This study referenced by the news report above found that, on the surveyed poultry farms, of 510 cloacal samples collected for ESBL detection, 305 (59.8%) _E. coli_ were ESBL-positive. The study also found that this high level of ESBL production in poultry facilities varied by type of poultry facility: an astounding 87% of cloacal samples from broiler farms were ESBL-positive, whereas 42% from layer farms were ESBL-positive. The prevalence of multidrug resistant (MDR) _E. coli_ was also higher in broiler farms (94%) as compared to layer farms (60%). ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae are usually highly resistant to multiple classes of antimicrobial drugs. In MDR organisms, genes encoding resistance are frequently linked so that exposure on farms to only one of the antibiotics whose resistance is genetically linked will select for emergence of resistance to the other genetically linked drugs. The authors of the study say that use of antimicrobials in animal husbandry in India is mostly unregulated; in fact, all the poultry farms included in this study used antimicrobials, usually for growth promotion rather than for disease prevention or treatment. However, the study was unable to obtain data on the exact types and amounts of antimicrobials used by the poultry facilities studied. Colonization of farm workers with antibiotic-resistant Enterobacteriaceae of animal origin has been found in European and North American studies (see ProMED-mail posts Staph. aureus - USA: (NC) livestock-associated, farm workers http://promedmail.org/post/20161119.4640552; Staph. aureus (MRSA) - UK: meat products, ST398 http://promedmail.org/post/20150718.3519015; Staph. aureus (MRSA) - Denmark: porcine, human, ST398, increased incidence http://promedmail.org/post/20140827.2725468; and Staph. aureus (MRSA) - USA: (NC) livestock-associated, farm workers http://promedmail.org/post/20130715.1825814) and is likely to have occurred in workers at the studied poultry facilities, as their workers frequently took no precautions when in contact with the poultry or their contaminated environment.

The EEE virus is transmitted by mosquitoes. The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection reported the positive test result to the Wisconsin Division of Public Health. No EEE cases in humans have been reported in Wisconsin this year or any year since 2011. The human EEE case in 2011 was only the 2nd case known to have occurred in Wisconsin since 1984. The 3 articles above include the following measures to prevent mosquito bites: - apply insect repellent containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535, or PMD to clothing as well as exposed skin since mosquitoes may bite through clothing. Be sure to follow the instructions on the label; - wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and socks when outdoors, especially at dawn and dusk to reduce the amount of exposed skin, as weather permits; - avoid being outdoors from dusk to dawn, peak mosquito biting times, if possible; - set up outdoor fans to keep mosquitoes from flying near you; - make sure window and door screens are in good repair to prevent mosquito entry; - any containers that can collect water, such as tin cans, plastic containers, ceramic pots, or discarded tires, should be discarded or dumped daily; turn over wheelbarrows, wading pools, boats, and canoes when not in use; - clean roof gutters and downspouts for proper drainage; - change the water in birdbaths and pet dishes at least every 3 days; - clean and chlorinate swimming pools, outdoor saunas, and hot tubs; drain water from pool covers; - trim tall grass, weeds, and vines since mosquitoes use these areas to rest during hot daylight hours; - landscape to prevent water from pooling in low-lying areas.

Since the last yellow fever epidemiological update published by the Pan American Health Organization, Regional Office of the World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO), only Bolivia has reported cases and no changes in the number of reported cases have been reported in the other countries. In Bolivia, between EW 3 and EW 30 of 2017, a total of 5 yellow fever cases were confirmed, including 3 deaths (case fatality rate 60 per cent) (figure 2: see URL above). None of the cases had been vaccinated and all were infected in known areas with risk of yellow fever transmission in the departments of La Paz (4 cases) and Cochabamba (1 case). The age range of the cases is between 9 and 48 years and the majority (80 per cent) are male. Recommendations PAHO/WHO urges member states to continue efforts to immunize at risk populations and take the necessary actions to keep travelers informed and vaccinated, when heading to areas where yellow fever vaccination is recommended. Vaccination The yellow fever vaccine is safe and affordable and provides effective immunity against the disease in the range of 80 to 100 per cent of those vaccinated after 10 days and 99 per cent immunity after 30 days. A single dose provides life-long protection against yellow fever disease. A booster dose of yellow fever vaccine is not needed. Given the limitations on the availability of vaccines and with the aim of promoting the rational use, PAHO / WHO reiterates its recommendations to national authorities: 1. Conduct an assessment of vaccination coverage against yellow fever in areas at risk at the municipal level to guarantee at least 95 per cent coverage among the resident population of these areas. 2. Member states that are not currently experiencing outbreaks should not conduct immunization campaign. Priority should be given to the use of vaccines in susceptible populations and to avoid revaccination. 3. Ensure vaccination of all travelers to endemic areas at least 10 days before traveling. 4. Depending on vaccine availabilities, member states should have a small stock that allows them to respond to outbreaks. 5. Postpone routine vaccination in children in non-endemic areas until sufficient vaccines are available. Once there is availability, catch-up campaigns should be conducted to complete vaccination schedules. Precautions It is recommended to individually assess the epidemiological risk of contracting disease when faced with the risk of an adverse event occurring in persons over 60 years who have not been previously vaccinated. - \uf0b7 The vaccine can be offered to individuals with asymptomatic HIV infection with CD4+ counts \u2265 200 cells / mm3 requiring vaccination. - \uf0b7 Pregnant women should be vaccinated in an emergency situation and following recommendations of health authorities. - \uf0b7 Vaccination is recommended in lactating women who live in endemic areas, since the risk of transmitting the vaccine virus to the child is lower than the benefits of the vaccination of breastfeeding women. - \uf0b7 For pregnant or lactating women traveling to areas with yellow fever transmission, vaccination is recommended when travel cannot be postponed or avoided. They should receive advice on the potential benefits and risks of vaccination to make an informed decision. The benefits of breastfeeding are superior to those of other nutritional alternatives. The following people are usually excluded from yellow fever vaccination: - immunocompromised individuals (Including those with thymus disorders, symptomatic HIV, malignant neoplasms under treatment, and those that are receiving or have received immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory treatments, recent transplants, and current or recent radiation therapy); - people with severe allergies to eggs and their derivatives. However, that risk will continue in Brazil, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru so long as the sylvan (forest) transmission cycle is occurring. Persistence of yellow fever virus in endemic sylvan (forest) cycles of transmission in the South American tropical forested countries is reason enough to maintain a high proportion of the population  at least 80 per cent  vaccinated in areas of risk. One hopes that efforts to provide vaccine coverage over broad areas of YF virus endemicity can continue to avoid the lapses in coverage the led to the outbreak in Brazil. Individuals planning on traveling to countries where YF is endemic should seek vaccination as soon as possible because there is a vaccine shortage that started in mid to late summer this year (2017) in the USA.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/samerica/southamericalarge.jpg. - Mod.TY   .

The Health Department said an elderly person was recovering in hospital after being diagnosed with serogroup Y meningococcal disease. The incidence had been decreasing dramatically in WA over time, from a peak of 86 cases in 2000, down to 16 in 2013. But last year 2016 23 cases were reported in WA, and there have been 15 so far in 2017. Departmental medical coordinator Professor Paul Effler said the increase was likely due to people developing an immunity to certain strains. \"I think it's in part to the mutations that happened, the changes that happened in the bacterium itself, people develop immunity to it, and we develop immunity across the population so it goes away and then it comes back if a new strain that we haven't been exposed to comes into the community,\" he said. \"The other thing that occurred is we started doing vaccinations against meningococcal C some years ago and that's helped drive down meningococcal serogroup C to record low levels.\" Professor Effler said outcomes were similar for all strains of the disease. He said a vaccination campaign had been launched for adolescents aged 15 to 19 after an increase in cases of the W strain. Teenagers in this group had the highest rates of carriage of the bacteria in the back of the nose and throat, and were believed most likely to be responsible for transmission to children and the elderly. \"Uptake of vaccination is good but we'd encourage any parents, or parents of teens, or teens that are out there in those years to make sure they look for their consent form that'll be coming home from the school so they can get their vaccination for free at school,\" he said.

Immunity following use of a meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine is specific for the type of capsular polysaccharide that the vaccine contains, with no cross-protection against infection due to other meningococcal polysaccharide groups. There are vaccines that contain capsular polysaccharide (A, C, Y, W135), either alone or conjugated to protein. Serogroup B vaccines are based upon meningococcal B protein antigens, because group B polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic in humans and is a potential auto-antigen. Following the mass introduction into the population of a vaccine specific for one particular serogroup, the incidence of disease due to that serogroup has been found to fall dramatically, such as, serogroup C disease in the UK following the introduction of C vaccine and serogroup A in the African meningitis belt following A vaccine, only to be replaced by emergence of disease due to other meningococcal serogroups. A similar situation is apparently occurring in Australia following the introduction of the conjugate meningococcal C vaccine in 2003. Since 2003, there has been a significant and sustained reduction in serogroup C meningococcal cases from 34 percent of cases in 2003 to 5.7 percent in 2012, accompanied by an increase in serogroup B from 60 percent in 2003 to 83 percent in 2012 ( ).

W http://promedmail.org/post/20160925.4513543). The above news report concerns a case due to meningococcal serogroup Y. Because of the replacement of serogroup C by serogroup W in the UK, the UK is now offering an expanded conjugated serogroup vaccine, Men ACWY, for adolescents, who are more likely to carry meningococcal bacteria than any other age group, to stop the spread of serogroup W. This is being done by replacing the routine teenage Men C booster with the Men ACWY vaccine ( ). Meningococcal serogroup B and quadrivalent conjugate (ACWY) vaccines are now funded for certain age groups in some Australian states \"in response to locally predominant meningococcal B or W disease\" ( ). In Western Australia, starting in 2017, use of the quadrivalent vaccine is now funded for teenagers.

Information about the cases appears in this week's FluView report. The cases bring the number of novel flu infections reported this year 2017 to 19, all but 1 reported in the last 30 days. The CDC said all 3 patients had contact with swine at agricultural fairs. At this time, 2 of the viruses have been fully characterized and are influenza A H3N2 variant (H3N2v) viruses. The 3rd virus has been characterized as an influenza A (H3) variant, and tests are under way to further characterize it. A variant influenza strain occurs when an influenza A virus that normally circulates in swine is detected in humans. A total of 4 states now report cases Texas, Ohio, North Dakota, and Pennsylvania are the only states to report variant strains this year 2017, with Ohio reporting 15 H3 variant viruses and one H1N2 variant virus (the other states have reported one H3N2v case each). Of the 3 cases announced todayFri 18 Aug 2017, 2 people attended the same fair. The Pennsylvania resident's exposure occurred out of state, according to FluView. The North Dakota Department of Health released a statement on Tue 15 Aug 2017 that said 2 people, one an out-of-state visitor, contracted the variant virus at the North Dakota State Fair in Minot. Two of the 3 patients were hospitalized, and all 3 have fully recovered from their infections. One patient was older than 64; the other 2 were children. H3N2v was 1st detected in humans in 2011.

Clinical characteristics of the A/H3N2v cases are generally consistent with those of seasonal influenza including fever, cough, pharyngitis, myalgia, and headache. Rapid detection and characterization of novel influenza viruses are important components of national efforts in the United States to prevent further cases and evaluate clinical illness associated with these viruses.

This is the correct post. - Mod.MHJ  Mon 24 Jul 2017 9:00 am CDT Source: My Steinbach, Farmscape report edited The President of the Canadian Association of Swine Veterinarians says a new more virulent strain of PRRS porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome is creating new challenges for pork producers and their veterinarians. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome is a swine-only virus that comes in a variety of strains, with clinical signs being dependent on the strain and the age or stage of growth of the pig. Dr Blaine Tully, the President of the Canadian Association of Swine Veterinarians and a partner with Swine Health Professionals in Steinbach, says that until this past winter 2016-2017, Manitoba has had less pathogenic strains of PRRS that producers and their veterinarians were able to manage fairly well. \"This past winter, and now into the spring and summer 2017, we continue to see farms infected with a strain that causes quite high levels of abortion in breeding herds, high levels of stillborn or mummified fetuses at birth, and then also quite high levels of mortality on suckling piglets and in the post weaning phases of growth, where we would see mortality range from, in some instances, double to quadruple normal farm baseline levels. \"Up into the ranges 40 percent of the piglets go on to die, and that is often leading into wean to finish mortality that is in the same range, 20 to 30 percent or higher. Not only does that have a quite a burden on the farm staff having to go through those health changes, but, economically, farms are really struggling with having a level of production that would still meet their sales targets,\" said Dr Tully. Dr Tully said that 12 to 15 farms in southeastern Manitoba, the Interlake, and central Manitoba are infected, and, because many of these farms sell animals to commercial slaughter facilities, the risk of further spread increases.

According to the latest data released by the MCD Municipal Corporation of Delhi, 71 cases of malaria, 55 cases of dengue, and 108 cases of chikungunya have been reported up to 1 Jul 2017. Doctors have confirmed that there are cases wherein a patient has tested positive for both malaria and dengue, as well malaria and chikungunya. At least 7 patients have tested positive for a co-infection at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, a senior hospital official confirmed. The latest case reported at the Delhi hospital is of a 30-year-old man, who came with the most common symptoms of chikungunya  fever and joint pain. \"When he was examined, the patient tested positive for chikungunya. Since there is no treatment for chikungunya, we treated the symptoms and advised the patient to drink fluids to avoid dehydration,\" Dr Atul Gogia, Consultant, Department of Medicine, Sir Gangaram Hospital, said. However, doctors said the symptoms of fever and chills did not abate. \"We tested the patient for malaria and it came back positive,\" the doctor said. In another case, a 22-year-man who was referred to Sir Gangaram Hospital had a reduced platelet count  a symptom of dengue. \"The patient had high grade fever and low platelet count. When examined, he tested positive for dengue. But the fever continued. We later tested for malaria and it was positive,\" Dr Gogia said. The doctor said patients with co-infections have to be correctly diagnosed to ensure no further complications arise. \"In dengue and chikungunya, one can only treat the symptoms. There is no specific treatment. However, when the patient has dengue and malaria, it should be ensured that malaria is diagnosed first. Since symptoms of malaria mimic those of dengue, it remains undiagnosed in most cases. Hence, diagnosis of malaria is most important as the infection is treatable unlike dengue and chikungunya,\" Dr Gogia said. Last year, AIIMS All India Institute of Medical Science had confirmed the presence of co-infections with chikungunya  9.4 per cent of patients had both dengue and chikungunya, while 3 per cent had malaria and chikungunya. Chikungunya and dengue are mosquito-borne viral infections with symptoms such as fever, rashes, and joint pain. The causative organism, chikungunya virus, is transmitted to humans by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito. Malaria, however, is a mosquito-borne infection caused by parasitic protozoans and is commonly transmitted by an infected female _Anopheles_ mosquito. Byline: Kaunain Sheriff M  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Both 'malaria' and 'dengue' are known to be rapidly spreading mosquito-borne diseases and of high importance in terms of both mortality and morbidity, posing a worldwide public health problem due to ease in globalised travel. Malaria is a protozoan parasitic infection caused by _Plasmodium_ spp. which is usually transmitted by _Anopheles_ spp. The major _Plasmodium_ spp. infecting humans are _P. falciparum_, _P. vivax_, _P. ovale_, and _P. malariae_ 1. Early differentiation between dengue and malaria could help clinicians to identify patients who should be closely monitored for signs of dengue hemorrhagic fever or severe malaria. Whereas dengue is a viral infection. The pathogen is dengue virus. The main mosquito vector is _Aedes_. Both diseases can cause acute febrile illness. However, malaria can be chronic while dengue cannot. The specific triads of dengue, atypical lymphocytosis, hemoconcentration, and thrombocytopenia might be a clue for differential diagnosis of dengue infection from other tropical infections including to malaria 2. Diagnostics for malaria should be employed first or concurrently in these settings, so that antimalarial therapy can be provided as soon as possible. There have been cases of dengue and malaria coinfections with leptospirosis, hepatitis, typhoid, and chikungunya infections, even up to the presence of 4 acute infections at the same time. In such cases, laboratory investigations are important to arrive at a definite diagnosis, but in settings of mixed infections, the interpretation may be challenging 3.<br><br><strong> References </strong><br> 1.

The disease was discovered during a routine blood test by the North Carolina Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, in Raleigh, and confirmed by the USDA United States Department of Agriculture. This is the 1st new case of EIA documented in North Carolina since 2005. \"The Johnston County facility is under a quarantine order that restricts movement of equines until further testing is completed by the NC Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services,\" said Michael Neault, DVM, director of livestock and animal health programs. \"Because the disease is not curable, the affected mule has been euthanized. The remaining equines at the facility were tested and were negative for EIA. They will be observed and retested in 60 days, and we are monitoring neighboring facilities for the disease.\" Equine infectious anemia is an incurable disease most commonly spread between equids  such as horses, mules, and donkeys  in close proximity to biting flies and ticks. Clinical signs of EIA include fever, weakness, weight loss, anemia, edema, and death; however, not all affected equids show clinical signs. All infected equids, including those that are asymptomatic, are carriers of the disease. There are typically a small number of EIA cases in the United States every year, although the disease is common in other parts of the world. The disease is controlled in the United States by regular testing before traveling across state lines, exhibition, and other events. A Coggins test screens horses' blood for antibodies that are indicative of the presence of EIA. There is no approved vaccine for EIA in the United States. To help prevent infection, owners can: - use sterile, disposable needles and syringes, one per horse, for all vaccines and medications; - test all horses for EIA every year, and at the time they enter a new premises; - keep stables and other facilities sanitary. Regularly clean stalls and properly dispose of manure away from horse stabling areas; - implement approved insect controls, such as insecticides and good drainage of standing water, to minimize fly presence; - only participate in events that require evidence of negative Coggins test for every equine entering the event to prevent disease introduction and spread; - isolate new horses on a property until they are tested for EIA; - never mix infected and healthy animals. Do not breed horses infected with EIA; and - follow state laws covering EIA.  communicated by: ProMED-mail How sad that this disease continues and there is no vaccine for it. We pour millions into other research projects, some of which seem to have little value, but why no vaccine? \"Under natural conditions, the most important mode of transmission of equine infectious anemia (EIA) is by the transfer of virus-infective blood by blood-feeding insects between horses in close proximity. Virus is found free in the plasma or cell associated, principally in monocytes and macrophages of infected animals. Although infection is considered primarily blood borne, all tissues and body fluids are potentially infectious, especially during episodes of clinical disease when viral burdens are high. Transmission of EIA by biting flies is purely mechanical; the virus does not replicate in the vector. The chance of transmission of EIA is directly proportional to the volume of blood retained on the mouthparts of the insect after feeding. In that respect, horse flies, deer flies, and to a lesser extent, stable flies are likely the most efficient vectors. It is also because they are capable of triggering host defensive behavior that interrupts feeding and results in their seeking a new susceptible host to complete their blood meal.\" Fly control is very important, in the barn and on the animal. Currently there is no vaccine for EIA in the US. There is a vaccine developed in China and used in other places (see Equine infectious anemia - USA (04): (KY) unlicensed vaccine http://promedmail.org/post/20150915.3645562).

While swine flu and dengue are spreading in the urban areas, the tribal hinterland has been beset with outbreaks of encephalitis since 2012. Though no Japanese encephalitis (JE) mortalities have been registered as yet in the official records, 473 acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) cases have been diagnosed so far. Odisha stands 5th in AES mortality after Uttar Pradesh, Assam, West Bengal and Bihar. According to the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, AES had taken 13 lives by the 1st week of August 2017. Apart from AES, 8 persons have fallen victim to swine flu in Odisha in the last 2 weeks. More than 100 positive cases have been detected. Dengue is the other scourge in the state with 2 deaths and 367 positive cases. Both AES and JE have been regular in Odisha since 2012. Last year, the state grabbed the national headlines when 115 children died of AES and 42 fell to JE. Most of the deaths were reported from Malkangiri district. But the state government has been equivocating on the incidence of AES. It went to the extent of claiming that consumption of seeds of a plant called _Cassia occidentalis_, locally known as Bada Chakunda, caused death of a 3rd of the children who fell to encephalitis in Malkangiri district. An expert committee suggested that JE could not be blamed for all the deaths because \"encephalopathy\" was the culprit. Encephalopathy, it said, is a non-infectious biochemical syndrome that can be aggravated by the consumption of _Cassia_ seeds. The fact is the Naveen Patnaik government remained aloof to the spread of AES, which is caused by a vector-borne virus hosted by pigs. The Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC), Bhubaneswar, carried out a study on the outbreak of AES in Malkangiri in 2015 but its findings were not paid heed to. From 38 deaths in 2012 to 115 in 2016, the AES surge was waiting to happen.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail As of the end of May 2017, there were 313 cases of AES with 10 deaths in Odisha and now the case count is 473 with 13 deaths in the 1st week of August 2017. Odisha state is endemic for Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus, and cases occur there frequently. As with cases of encephalitis mentioned above and in other states in northeastern India, not all encephalitis cases are due to JE virus and are classified as acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) with undetermined etiology. As noted in previous ProMED-mail comments, AES is a term used for multiple etiologies or often when no etiology has been determined. The encephalitis picture in northeastern India is complicated. Although JE virus etiology of some previously reported encephalitis cases has been confirmed by laboratory tests, many cases go undiagnosed, or JE virus infection is ruled out, and other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus (_O. tsutsugamushi_) and lychee fruit consumption, have been proposed. However, in November 2016 the Odisha state government formed the 6-member panel, led by eminent virologist Dr Jacob John from Vellore's Christian Medical College. In the interim report, Dr John said that anthraquinone, a toxin found in the plant _Cassia occidentalis_, was found in the urine sample of 5 deceased children. \"This indicates that the children (had) consumed the seeds of the plant,\" he said. Getting to an accurate diagnosis in these cases of AES will require active field surveillance with epidemiological studies supported by timely laboratory testing. - Mod.TY _Cassia occidentalis_, also called _Senna occidentalis_, produces seeds, in long seed pods that are sometimes roasted and made into a coffee-like beverage, Its roots, leaves, flowers, and seeds have been used medicinally as, for example, a laxative (attributed to the actions of anthraquinones found in the plant), an antipyretic, a tonic , and a diuretic ( ). - Mod.ML ", "dates": ["Date: Sat 19 Aug 2017 2:24 AM", "had taken 13 lives by the 1st week of August [2017]", " From 38 deaths in 2012 to 115 in 2016 the AES", "[As of the end of May [2017] there were 313 cases of AES with 10", "deaths in Odisha and now the case count is 473 with 13 deaths in the", "1st week of August [2017]"], "title": "Japanese encephalitis and other - India (16): (OR)\r\n\t"}, "162": {"sentences": " Magill Partners GeoSentinel Global TravEpiNet Mobile Apps RSS Feeds  Zika Virus in the British Virgin Islands  Recommend on Facebook  Tweet  Share Compartir  Warning - Level 3, Avoid Nonessential Travel  Alert - Level 2, Practice Enhanced Precautions  Watch - Level 1, Practice Usual Precautions  Language:  Select  Espa&ntilde;ol  What is the current situation?  Zika virus (or Zika) has been reported in the British Virgin Islands. Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in the British Virgin Islands are infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:  Women who are pregnant:  Do not travel to the British Virgin Islands.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to the British Virgin Islands or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers considering pregnancy:  Before you or your partner travel, talk to your health care provider about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection.  Wait before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.  If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex &ndash; or do not have sex &ndash; for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex, or do not have sex, for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy  Talk to your health care provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you&rsquo;re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Wait at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  Men are advised to wait longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.gov  Contact CDC  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  1600 Clifton Road  Atlanta ,  GA  30329-4027  USA  800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)  Contact CDC-INFO  TOP", "dates": [" Page created: August 30 2016", " Page last updated: August 08 2017", " Page last reviewed: August 08 2017", " 30329-4027", " 800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)"], "title": ["Zika Virus in the British Virgin Islands"]}, "311": {"sentences": "   Wed 26 Jul 2017 8:00 AM EDT Source: Nunatsiaq Online edited Nunavik Quebec health officials have confirmed that beluga whale meat consumed in Inukjuak earlier in July 2017 was infected with the bacterium that causes botulism. Botulism is believed to have killed an Inukjuak woman in her 50s on 8 Jul 2017 and affected the woman's daughter, who was treated in Montreal hospital and later released. Botulism is a rare but serious illness caused by a toxin that affects the nervous system and can cause paralysis and in serious cases, death. \"We had a call from the health centre that morning, and the doctor on call had spoken to family members to understand what had happened,\" said Dr Marie Rochette, coordinator of infectious disease prevention at Nunavik's public health department. Health care workers identified beluga meat, which was sent to Ottawa for testing and came back positive for _Clostridium botulinum_, the bacterium that causes botulism. Officials are still waiting on the results of 2 other samples of beluga meat. The health centre in Inukjuak reported treating other patients with symptoms of botulism, although it remains unclear if those patients ate the same beluga meat and no other cases were confirmed. The meat in question came from belugas hunted near Umiujaq at the end of June 2017, Rochette said, when temperatures along the Hudson Bay coast rose as high as 28 deg C 82.4 deg F. \"Warm temperatures can be the cause of the bacterial growth,\" Rochette said. Public health issued a warning to Inukjuamiut and anyone else who had beluga meat, fat, or oil from that harvest to throw out the products. The affected meat appeared to be limited to the whale's inside flesh, however; a number of people ate maqtaq also called muktuk, it is a traditional Inuit/Eskimo meal of frozen whale skin and blubber - Mod.LL and didn't fall ill, Rochette said. Despite the tragic death of the Inukjuak woman, cases of botulism remain rare in the region. Over the last decade, Nunavik has seen anywhere between zero and 3 cases of foodborne botulism a year, with no other recent deaths. \"But with warming temperatures, these are conditions for the bacteria to grow,\" Rochette said. \"That's why we are warning hunters to be very careful to put harvested meat on ice or in a cooler right away.\" Symptoms of botulism can include: - fatigue, weakness and dizziness; - blurred or double vision; - dryness in the mouth, throat and nose and difficulty in swallowing and speaking; - headache; - nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and, less commonly, diarrhea; and - paralysis that starts in the shoulders and arms and moves down the body. Symptoms of foodborne botulism generally begin 12 to 36 hours after consuming contaminated food, but onset can begin as soon as 6 hours after exposure or as long as 10 days later. Rochette urges any Nunavimmiut who experiences those symptoms to go to their local health centre immediately. Byline: Sarah Rogers  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. The exact number of potential botulism cases referred to is not stated. The following publication summarizes 2 decades of botulism in Canada, a great majority occurring due to type E in the native population, associated with ingestion of food products from marine sources: Leclair D, Fung J, Isaac-Renton JL, et al. Foodborne botulism in Canada, 1985-2005. Emerg Infect Dis. 2013; 19(6): 961-8;  .<br><br><strong> Abstract </strong><br> During 1985-2005, a total of 91 laboratory-confirmed outbreaks of foodborne botulism occurred in Canada; these outbreaks involved 205 cases and 11 deaths. Of the outbreaks, 75 (86.2 percent) were caused by _Clostridium botulinum_ type E, followed by types A (7/8.1 percent) and B (5/5.7 percent). Approximately 85 percent of the outbreaks occurred in Alaska Native communities, particularly the Inuit of Nunavik in northern Quebec and the First Nations population of the Pacific coast of British Columbia. These populations were predominantly exposed to type E botulinum toxin through the consumption of traditionally prepared marine mammal and fish products. 2 botulism outbreaks were attributed to commercial ready-to-eat meat products and 3 to foods served in restaurants; several cases were attributed to non-Native home-prepared foods. A total of 3 affected pregnant women delivered healthy infants. Improvements in botulism case identification and early treatment have resulted in a reduction in the case-fatality rate in Canada. The following was abstracted from a 2001 CDC report on foodborne botulism in the native American population in Alaska and underscores changes in the fermentation techniques which appear to have increased the risks of this intoxication ( ): This report illustrates how the use of nontraditional fermentation methods is associated with foodborne botulism in Alaska. Botulism results from eating preformed toxin produced by _Clostridium botulinum_. Botulism intoxication can result in death, which most often is caused by respiratory failure. The latent period is typically 12-36 hours but can range from 6 hours to 10 days (1). _C. botulinum_ and closely related organisms produce toxins designated as types A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Human botulism is most commonly caused by types A, B, and E. Type E is associated with foods of marine or freshwater origin. Alaska's foodborne botulism rates exceed those in any other state and are among the highest in the world (1). During 1950-2000, Alaska recorded 226 cases of foodborne botulism from 114 outbreaks. All patients were Alaska Natives, and all cases with known causes were associated with eating fermented foods (1,2). Approximately 27 percent of US foodborne botulism cases occur in Alaska. In traditional fermentation, food is kept in a grass-lined hole in the ground or a wooden barrel sunken into the ground or is placed in a shady area above ground for several weeks to months. Since the 1970s, however, plastic or glass containers have been used and fermentation has been done above ground or indoors. The anaerobic condition of sealed containers and warmer temperatures make fermentation more rapid and production of botulism toxin more likely (3-5). These nontraditional methods have been associated with increased botulism rates in Alaska during 1970-1989 (4,5). Although a plastic container was not used in this outbreak, the beaver tail and paw were fermented in a closed rice sack and stored in a warm area. Early diagnosis and antitoxin treatment have contributed to the decline of the case fatality rate from approximately 31 percent during 1950-1959 to no deaths in Alaska since 1994 (1). However, Alaska continues to have high foodborne botulism rates because fermented foods are part of Alaska Native culture. In a 1999 survey, 107 (77 percent) of 140 Alaska Natives reported having eaten fermented foods at least once in their lifetime (3).<br><br><strong> References </strong><br> 1. Beller M.

Further human infections with viruses of animal origin are expected. - IHR compliance: all human infections caused by a new influenza subtype are required to be reported under the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005). This includes any animal and non-circulating seasonal influenza viruses. Information from these notifications is critical to inform risk assessments for influenza at the human-animal interface.<br><br><strong> Avian influenza A(H5) viruses -</strong><br> Current situation: since the last update on 15 Jun 2017, no new laboratory-confirmed human cases of influenza A(H5N1) virus infection were reported to WHO. Since 2003, a total of 859 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, including 453 deaths, have been reported to WHO from 16 countries. Influenza A(H5) subtype viruses have the potential to cause disease in humans and thus far, no human cases, other than those with influenza A(H5N1) and A(H5N6) viruses, have been reported to WHO. According to reports received by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), various influenza A(H5) subtypes continue to be detected in birds in Africa, Europe and Asia.<br><br><strong> Avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses -</strong><br> Current situation: during this reporting period, 24 laboratory-confirmed human cases of influenza A(H7N9) virus infection were reported to WHO from China. Cases were reported with likely exposure in Yunnan province for the 1st time. As of 25 Jul 2017, a total of 1557 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses, including at least 605 deaths, have been reported to WHO. The number of human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses and the geographical distribution of human cases in the 5th epidemic wave (that is, onset since 1 Oct 2016) have been greater than in any earlier wave. This suggests that the virus has spread, and emphasizes that further intensive surveillance and control measures in both the human and animal health sectors are crucial. However, the number of reported confirmed cases has continued to decline over the past few weeks with only one case reported thus far with an onset of illness after 23 Jun 2017. According to reports received by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) on surveillance activities for avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses in China, positives among virological samples continue to be detected in poultry from live bird markets, commercial, and backyard farms. The agricultural authorities in China have also announced plans to commence vaccination of domestic poultry nation-wide against infection with avian influenza A(H7) viruses beginning in September 2017.<br><br><strong> Risk assessment -</strong><br> 1. What is the likelihood that additional human cases of infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses will occur? Most human cases are exposed to the A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, further human cases can be expected. Additional sporadic human cases of influenza A(H7N9) in other provinces in China that have not yet reported human cases are also expected. 2. What is the likelihood of human-to-human transmission of avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses? Even though small clusters of cases have been reported, including those involving healthcare workers, currently available epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans, thus the likelihood is low. 3. What is the risk of international spread of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus by travellers? Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.<br><br><strong> Avian influenza A(H9N2) viruses -</strong><br> Current situation: on 30 Jun 2017, one case of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) virus was reported to WHO from China in a 2-month old female child who lives in Guangdong province, China. She had onset of influenza-like illness (ILI) on 28 Apr 2017. The patient was hospitalized on 9 Jun 2017. A sample collected from the patient on 13 Jun 2017 as part of ILI surveillance was laboratory-confirmed as positive for A(H9N2) influenza virus on 16 Jun 2017. The patient was exposed to backyard poultry prior to illness. The case has fully recovered.<br><br><strong> Risk assessment -</strong><br> 1. What is the likelihood that additional human cases of infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) viruses will occur? Most human cases are exposed to the A(H9N2) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments. Human infection tends to result in mild clinical illness. Since the virus continues to be detected in poultry populations, further human cases can be expected. 2. What is the likelihood of human-to-human transmission of avian influenza A(H9N2) viruses? No case clusters have been reported. Currently available epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans, thus the likelihood is low. 3. What is the risk of international spread of avian influenza A(H9N2) virus by travellers? Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.<br><br><strong> Overall risk management recommendations -</strong><br> - WHO does not advise special traveller screening at points of entry or restrictions with regard to the current situation of influenza viruses at the human-animal interface. For recommendations on safe trade in animals from countries affected by these influenza viruses, refer to OIE guidance. - WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal faeces. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices. - Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health. Continued vigilance is needed within affected and neighbouring areas to detect infections in animals and humans. As the extent of virus circulation in animals is not clear, epidemiological and virological surveillance and the follow-up of suspected human cases should remain high. - All human infections caused by a new influenza subtype are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005). State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this report. - It is critical that influenza viruses from animals and people are fully characterized in appropriate animal or human health influenza reference laboratories and reported according to international standards. Under WHO's Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework, Member States are expected to share their influenza viruses with pandemic potential on a regular and timely basis with the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), a WHO-coordinated network of public health laboratories. The viruses are used by the public health laboratories to assess the risk of pandemic influenza and to develop candidate vaccine viruses.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\.

The victim died 28 days after being bitten by a dog on Tue 20 Jun 2017 according to Hongxing News. The woman had received 4 rabies shots in a hospital in Xi'an, capital of Shaanxi Province, the report said. The story fueled a public outcry, with an online post about it attracting nearly 5000 comments on Sina Weibo, a Twitter-like service. Many questioned the quality of the rabies vaccine. Authorities with Xi'an Food and Drug Administration said they would investigate the storage, transportation and use of rabies vaccines in the city. An investigation will also be conducted at outpatient services handling exposure to rabies. Any organizations or individuals found illegally storing and transporting vaccines will face \"a severe crackdown\", according to the administration. A scandal broke in 2016 in which millions of dollars of improperly stored or expired vaccines were sold to patients nationwide. A total of 125 people were arrested and 37 officials put under investigation for negligence and graft. Following the scandal, the country carried out a series of measures to fix loopholes in the distribution of vaccines, including banning drug wholesalers from selling vaccines and reforming distribution channels for the country's non-compulsory vaccines. Rabies is a class 2 notifiable disease in China. As dogs have become popular as pets in China, cases of rabies have been on the increase. In 2006, at least 16 people died of rabies in eastern China's Shandong Province after several dog attacks.  communicated by: ProMED-mail rapporteur George A Robertson A previous case of suspected vaccine failure in a human in China was reported by ProMED-mail in http://promedmail.org/post/20050718.2071; there may have been others. China is a high-risk environment for rabies, with human rabies cases 2nd only to India globally. In 2014, nearly 1000 rabies related deaths were reported. Rabies geographic distribution has expanded for the recent years, according to a 2016 review paper (ref 1), covering 55 years of rabies epidemiology in mainland China, and detailed analysis of data in recent years. The authors state that rabies still remains a serious public health problem in China, the east and south regions more seriously affected compared with other regions. Males in rural areas had higher risk of infection than residents in urban areas, a clear seasonal pattern has been observed with a peak in August.<br><br><strong> References </strong><br> 1.

As a safety measure, the refuge has closed down 2 areas in the park, including Paul's Lake. \"To protect our visitors, we have voluntarily closed the area where plague has been found. It is well marked and we are asking the public to respect all signs and closures for their own safety,\" the park's manager Jude Smith explained in the statement. The outbreak is currently limited to 2 prairie dog populations. While the plague can be transferred from the infected animals to humans or other animals through infected flea bites, park officials ensure the public that it is still safe to visit the open areas.

The district said that 3 adult yellow fever mosquitoes, known as _Aedes aegypti_, were collected from Corcoran. The mosquito species is capable of transmitting yellow fever, dengue fever and the Zika and chikungunya viruses. The Kings Mosquito Abatement District recommends that Corcoran residents prevent mosquito breeding by ensuring that pools and spas are properly maintained and emptying containers to get rid of any standing water. The district also suggests using screens on doors and windows and using insect repellent with effective ingredients such as Deet, Picaridin or oil of lemon eucalyptus. Michael Cavanagh, district manager of the Kings Mosquito Abatement District, said that \"because this mosquito prefers to breed in small containers, it is very difficult to control with traditional mosquito control techniques. Residents are encouraged to contact the district if they experience mosquitoes biting during the day and indoors.\"  communicated by: ProMED-mail This is the 1st report that ProMED-mail has posted of detection of _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes in Kings county, California. Finding _Aedes aegypti_ in this county is not surprising. Both _Aedes aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ have been found in various locations in California over the past 13 years (see archives listed below). Both of them have been detected in southern California in several new locations over the past 1-3 years. Fortunately, few individuals have been trapped in these locations, indicating very small populations that are probably too limited to initiate and sustain ongoing Zika, chikungunya or dengue virus transmission. Air conditioning and screened windows and doors will help limit their abundance. However, the introduction of these viruses into southern California will continue, so aggressive vector surveillance and control will be important to limit populations of these vectors. - Mod.TY   .

The FDA is advising consumers to avoid all varieties of papayas from the Carica de Campeche farm in the Yucatan Peninsula, after numerous positive salmonella detections were made. The outbreak of the strains _Salmonella_ Kiambu and _S._ Thompson has left one person dead in New York and has now infected 108 others across 16 states, according to the CDC. So far 35 people have been hospitalized. Last week week of 24 Jul 2017, Texas-based papaya supplier Grande Produce initiated a limited recall of its products. \"The FDA is now advising that consumers avoid Caribena brand Maradol papayas and all varieties of papayas from the Carica de Campeche farm located in Campeche, Mexico as a result of the FDA's traceback investigation and testing,\" the FDA said in an update. \"The FDA is working to identify the brand(s) that these papayas are sold under and facilitate recall(s). Meanwhile, consumers should ask their retailers about the source of their papayas.\" It said papayas from Carica de Campeche tested positive for _Salmonella_ serotypes Kiambu, Thompson, Agona, Senftenberg and Gaminara. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is pending for these samples, and the Carica de Campeche farm has been added to Import Alert (IA) 99-35. Since the CDC's earlier update, 6 more states have reported ill people: Connecticut, Delaware, Michigan, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Wisconsin. Previously people have been infected in the states of Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, and Virginia. New York and New Jersey have seen the highest number of cases. The FDA said it had increased testing of papayas from Mexico in an effort to see if fruit from other farms could be contaminated. If it finds _Salmonella_ in other shipments, those farms will also be added to the alert. Since 2011 papayas from Mexico have not been allowed to enter the country without documentation that shows they have tested negative for the bacterium, it said. \"Farms/companies have been able to request addition onto the \"green\" list of IA 21-17 when they have had 5 consecutive shipments test negative for _Salmonella_,\" the FDA said. \"In contrast, farms/companies who want to request removal from the \"red\" list of IA 99-35 must present substantive documentation demonstrating that they have made corrections to prevent contamination, including, for example, a root cause analysis to identify potential sources and routes of contamination. \"The FDA traceback and traceforward investigation is still ongoing and additional brands may be identified; the FDA will update its advice as we learn more.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\.

These cases are from Xaisomboun, a previously unaffected province. To date, the total number of confirmed cVDPV1 cases in this outbreak is 5.  Details of the additional cases  The first case is a 7 month-old male with an onset of paralysis on 3 October. He lives in Hom district, Xaisomboun province. The case received oral polio vaccine (OPV) on 30 September. On 4 November, stool samples were collected from 2 close contacts; both of these contacts tested positive for cVDPV1.  The second case is a 14-year-old male with onset of fever on 26 October and paralysis on 28 October. The case lives in Anouvong District, Xaisomboun Province. He has a history of receiving one OPV. On 6 and 7 November, stool specimens were collected from 3 of his contacts, including household contacts and contacts from neighboring households; 2 of these contacts tested positive for cVDPV1.  According to WHO criteria, these 2 cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) are to be classified as confirmed cVDPV1 cases. In addition, circulating VDPV1 (cVDPV1) has also been isolated from the stools of 16 healthy contacts in Bolikhamxay and Xaisomboun Provinces since the beginning of the outbreak.  Public health response  Since the detection of the first confirmed cVDPV1 in Lao PDR, outbreak response activities have been conducted in the affected provinces (Bolikhamxay and Xaisoumboun) and a neighbouring province (Xiengkhuang). The national emergency operations centre was activated to coordinate response efforts and a polio outbreak response plan was drafted. Enhanced surveillance is occurring throughout the country, including daily zero-reporting of AFP cases. Active case finding is ongoing in the three provinces, including retrospective review of hospital and health centre records.  Six rounds with trivalent OPV vaccine have been planned from October 2015 to March 2016 (4 sub-national and 2 national) with ~ 8.6 million doses to be administered to children younger than 15 years. This age range was determined by the age distribution of the cases and their contacts. The first and second rounds of supplementary immunization activity (SIA) with OPV vaccine were completed in October and November in Bolikhamxay, Xaisoumboun and Xiengkhuang provinces. Independent monitors were recruited to assess the quality of the campaigns.  To ensure the success of SIAs, emergency risk communications and social mobilization activities, including training of mobilizers and information sessions to build trust and address barriers in the community to immunization, are being conducted.  WHO risk assessment  cVDPVs are rare but well-documented strains of poliovirus mutated from strains in OPV. They can emerge in some populations that are inadequately immunized. Ending polio requires eliminating both wild and vaccine-derived polio, and due to the small risk of cVDPVs, use of OPV must be stopped to secure a lasting polio-free world.  OPV will be withdrawn in a phased manner, beginning with the removal of type 2-containing OPV. The switch from trivalent to bivalent OPV, planned in April 2016, will reduce the risk of cVDPV substantially (as 90% of cVDPV is caused by type 2) and sets the stage to eventually stop using OPV altogether and transition to the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), which cannot cause cVDPV.  Because of relatively limited travel to and from this area and the planned immunization activities, WHO assesses the risk of international spread of the cVDPV1 from Lao to be low.  WHO advice  It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for AFP cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.  WHO\u2019s International Travel and Health recommends that all travelers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or IPV within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel.

The yellow papayas have been distributed to stores throughout the state of Maryland. State officials discovered the contamination in the course of an ongoing salmonellosis case investigation, according to the Mon 19 Jun 2017 warning from the Maryland Department of Health posted the warning. \"Consumers are encouraged to check their papayas and throw them away, if they match the brand and type,\" the state warned. The health department's Laboratories Administration tested 5 yellow Maradol papayas, collected from a Baltimore retail location, as part of the ongoing investigation. Three of the 5 yellow papayas tested were confirmed to be contaminated with the bacterium. The state has not yet identified the source of the contamination. Officials report it could have occurred at any point in the supply chain. This is a reoccurring issue for this brand of papayas, since a Texas recall for salmonella back in 2012. Salmonella bacteria can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy people infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea that is often bloody, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections, endocarditis and arthritis. Byline: Kelsey M. Mackin  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. The number of cases of salmonellosis linked to the papayas is not stated, only that a case investigation was going on. In 2011, about 100 cases of salmonellosis, serotype Agona, were linked to Mexican papayas, in 23 states. - Mod.LL   .

Rift Valley Fever (RVF) was reported in 10 out of the 21 regions of Tanzania: 12 cases were reported in Arusha region, 1 in Dar es Salaam, 156 in Dodoma, 4 in Iringa, 6 in Manyara, 50 in Morogoro, 5 in Mwanza, 5 in the Pwani, 24 in Singida, and 1 in Tanga regions. Only severe cases of RVF were detected through surveillance and of the 264 cases, 154 (60%) were laboratory confirmed.  The surveillance of RVF organized through the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) program has been in place in Tanzania for several years. To investigate this outbreak a WHO team from the Department of Epidemic and Pandemic Alert and Response and the Regional Office for Africa has been assisting the WHO Country Office in the assessment of the outbreak and in refining the health component of the Tanzania Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (TMOHSW) and the Tanzania Ministry of Livestock Development (TMOLD) emergency response plan, including the early warning system, active case detection, case management and social mobilization.  A national investigation team conducted several field visits in the affected region to help with enhancement of surveillance, in-depth case investigations and active surveillance activities. The team also provided training in patient care for clinical staff and in safe sample collection and shipment for laboratory staff. The response to the outbreak was jointly organized by the Tanzania Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (TMOHSW) and the Tanzania Ministry of Livestock Development (TMOLD) in collaboration with the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, WHO and FAO. The United Nations Emergency Coordination Group of UNDP, WHO, FAO, UNICEF and WFP have also outlined response plans in support of the Government strategy.

Zika virus (or Zika) has been reported in Paraguay. Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in Paraguay are infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:  Women who are pregnant:  Do not travel to Paraguay.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to Paraguay or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers considering pregnancy:  Before you or your partner travel, talk to your health care provider about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection.  Wait before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.  If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex &ndash; or do not have sex &ndash; for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex, or do not have sex, for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy  Talk to your health care provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you&rsquo;re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Wait at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  Men are advised to wait longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.gov  Contact CDC  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  1600 Clifton Road  Atlanta ,  GA  30329-4027  USA  800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)  Contact CDC-INFO  TOP", "dates": [" Page created: December 10 2015", " Page last updated: August 08 2017", " Page last reviewed: August 08 2017", " 30329-4027", " 800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)"], "title": ["Zika Virus in Paraguay"]}, "504": {"sentences": "   Fri 25 Aug 2017 22:30:30 Source: Xinhua News Agency edited Greek authorities said on Fri 25 Aug 2017 that 3 people in Greece infected with the West Nile virus WNV died of complications related to the illness this summer 2017.

Chip Lake is among 5 Edmonton-area lakes currently under a blue-green algae advisory. Naturally occurring blue-green algae appears like scum, grass clippings, fuzz or globs on the surface of water, AHS said. It can appear green, blue, brown or even shades of pink and often has a musty smell. People who come in contact with blue-green algae can experience skin irritation, rash, sore throat, sore red eyes, swollen lips, fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. Symptoms usually appear within one to 3 hours and resolve in 1 to 2 days. Visitors to the lake are being advised to take precautions. Avoid all contact with blue-green algae and do not swim or wade where the algae are visible. People may safely eat fish fillets, but should limit eating whole fish or fish trimmings. Pets should not be fed any fish from the lake, AHS said. Boiling water will not remove the toxins produced by blue-green algae, and alternate sources of drinking water should always be provided for pets and livestock, AHS said. The advisory for Chip Lake will remain in place until further notice. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ Blue-green algae (also known as cyanobacteria) are the only group of algae to be toxic in freshwaters. They are microscopic bacteria living in water, and are capable of photosynthesising, which is why they are often called algae. Though microscopic, when they form colonies and accumulate they can become visible to the naked eye. Blue-green algae can produce potent liver and neurotoxins as well as skin irritants. However, not all blue-green algae are toxic, and even toxic species do not always produce toxins. But telling the difference in toxic and non-toxic species is challenging. Blue-green algae can pose a risk to human health because of the toxins they produce. These toxins can damage the liver and neurological system of both humans and animals, and in severe cases can cause death. The cell walls of all blue-green algae contain contact irritants which can cause gastrointestinal, skin, eye, and respiratory irritations to humans and animals.

The mosquitoes were found in the area of Dorr Street and Westwood on Fri 18 Aug 2017. Asian Tiger mosquitoes are typically daytime biting mosquitoes that are associated with being potential carriers for several mosquitoborne diseases of concern, such as the Zika virus. The mosquitoes are the 1st documented population of the invasive species within Lucas County. They breed in cryptic water-holding containers commonly found around homes. Officials say that it's very important that homeowners look for potential mosquito breeding locations around their homes to help contain and prevent the spread of this mosquito. To reduce mosquito breeding, empty standing water from flowerpots, gutters, buckets, pool covers, birdbaths and other containers that hold water. If homeowners have containers that are too big to empty, officials say products that contain BTI, or _Bacillus thuringiensis_ serotype israelensis, work to control mosquito larvae and can be purchased from home improvement stores. Officials say these products can be very effective is used according to the manufacturer's instructions and individual product label. Residents at Ottawa Park say they wonder how the first documented Asian tiger mosquitos made its way to the area, but they are not intimidated by these day biting invasive mosquitoes. Toledo Area Sanitary District employees will canvass area neighborhoods looking for mosquito breeding locations over the next few days. Control efforts have been increased in the area and surveillance will be ongoing to determine the extent of the mosquitoes' establishment. \"We have the mosquito here we don't know if we have the disease here, it doesn't appear we do,\" said Eric Zgodzinski, health commissioner. \"So the concept is that we can now focus in on that we have the mosquito so we know it's here now we need to treat it like any other mosquito and not get bitten.\" If you notice anything out of the ordinary after a bite, the health department encourages you to contact your doctor. This mosquito was found in Clark county last year (2016) as well. As noted in earlier comments, although most of the new localities in which _Aedes albopictus_ has been detected have been in California, the species has been extending its known range northward and recently has been found in Nebraska, Connecticut, Indiana, Ohio, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Unlike _A. aegypti_, _A. albopictus_ eggs can go into diapause and withstand freezing winter temperatures. However, as University of Wisconsin-Madison entomologist Susan Paskewitz points out, viable populations of this species have not yet become established in these northern states. While most reports identify _A. albopictus_ as vectors of dangerous tropical and subtropical viruses such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, no mention is made about their potential role as vectors of viruses that are of public health concern in temperate zones in the eastern USA  La Crosse and Jamestown Canyon. It has been shown in the laboratory that this mosquito species is susceptible to infection by both of these orthobunyaviruses. Dual infections by both of these viruses can result in reassortment of the 3 RNA strands, with all 6 reassortants produced. These 2 viruses can co-circulate in the same woodlands in places like the Upper Midwest of the USA. Should _A. albopictus_ become established in ecosystems where these 2 viruses are endemic, the emergence of new, reassorted viruses is possible. - Mod.

In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea: \"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as \"potentially the most important medical advance\" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5). \"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below.

State of Ohio officials shut down the hog barn on Thu 13 Jul 2017 after swine flu was detected in a pig see Influenza, swine - USA: (OH) H3N2 http://promedmail.org/post/20170717.5180499. On Fri 14 Jul 2017, Clinton County Health Commissioner Pamela Walker Bauer reported there now are 11 lab-confirmed cases of the H3N2 flu virus in people. Lab testing by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is still underway to see whether there is a connection to the specific variation of the swine flu found at the fair, she said. A total of about 13 people were reported sick with flu-like illness to the Clinton County Health District, but 2 of them did not test positive for the H3N2 flu virus, according to Walker Bauer. Of the 11 lab-confirmed human cases of the H3N2 flu virus, the age range is from 7 months to 64 years old, reported Walker Bauer. The age bracket of 10 and younger has a higher level of incidence among the 11 cases compared to other age brackets, she said. Of those 11 patients, 8 are Clinton County residents, 2 are Warren Countians, and one lives in Highland County. By gender, 6 are males and 5 are females. All 11 patients reportedly are recovering, said the Clinton County health commissioner. Also Fri 14 Jul 2017, state officials said nearly 50 hogs at another county fair in Ohio were removed for slaughter after at least 2 animals tested positive for swine flu, according to The Associated Press (AP). The Ohio Department of Agriculture says the hogs were removed from the Franklin County Fair on Wed 19 Jul 2017 for slaughter. The Franklin County Agricultural Society said Thu 20 Jul 2017 that livestock areas have been disinfected. State officials last week week of 9-15 Jul 2017 ordered approximately 300 hogs slaughtered after the discovery of swine flu cases at the Clinton County Fair, added the AP. Agriculture Department spokesman Mark Bruce told The Columbus Dispatch the 2 incidents aren't related and involved different strains of influenza. He said viruses have an easier time infecting the animals when the weather is hot and humid more likely due to the stress on the animals in the fair environment and the mixing of large numbers of animals from different farms - Mod.JH. Byline: Gary Huffenberger  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ A nice example of cross influenza virus infection between swine and people. - Mod.MHJ The report above mentions that the influenza cases have been identified to be caused by A/H3N2 virus; it is not clear whether these are due to the swine variant of influenza A/H3N2 termed as A/H3N2v. However, as swine influenza was recently reported in pigs at the fair, the possibility of animal to human transmission is likely. The A/H3N2v viruses were first identified in US pigs in 2010 ( ). Between 2011 and September 2016, 364 human H3N2v cases were reported from 14 states. The largest outbreak occurred in 2012 when a total of 309 human cases of H3N2v flu were identified, including 16 hospitalizations and one death ( ). The majority of cases were exhibitors and others in close contact with pigs at agricultural fairs. Symptoms of H3N2v infection in people are usually mild and similar to those of seasonal flu viruses, but as with seasonal flu, complications can lead to hospitalization and death. Clinical features may include fever and respiratory symptoms, such as cough and runny nose, as well as body aches, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. The incubation period (the time it takes from exposure to onset of illness) for this influenza is also typically similar to seasonal influenza at about 2 days, but may be up to 10 days. There are ways to reduce the spread of influenza viruses between pigs and people ( ). CDC recommendations for people not at high risk include: - don't take food or drink into pig areas; don't eat, drink, or put anything in your mouth in pig areas; - don't take toys, pacifiers, cups, baby bottles, strollers, or similar items into pig areas. Avoid close contact with pigs that look or act ill; - take protective measures if you must come in contact with pigs that are known or suspected to be sick. This includes minimizing contact with pigs and wearing personal protective equipment like protective clothing, gloves and masks that cover your mouth and nose when contact is required; - wash your hands often with soap and running water before and after exposure to pigs. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub; - to further reduce the risk of infection, minimize contact with pigs in the pig barn or arenas; - avoid contact with pigs if you have flu symptoms. Wait to have contact with pigs until 7 days after your illness started or until you have been without fever for 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medications, whichever is longer; - people with high risk factors who develop flu symptoms should call a health care provider; The same influenza antiviral drugs used to treat seasonal flu can be used to treat variant virus infection. CDC recommendations for people with high risk factors include: - anyone who is at high risk of serious flu complications ( ) planning to attend a setting where pigs will be present should avoid pigs and swine barns; - people who are at high risk of serious flu complications include children younger than 5 years, people 65 years and older, pregnant women, and people with certain long-term health conditions (like asthma and other lung disease, diabetes, heart disease, weakened immune systems, and neurological or neuro-developmental conditions). - Mod.UBA Since H3N2 viruses first appeared in pigs in 1998 there have been other documented swine-origin influenza A spillover cases in humans prior to the emergence of the A/H3N2v virus that contains the matrix protein from the H1N1 2009 pandemic virus. These other spillover events have typically been associated with swine farm workers, county fairs, etc. ( and ). Due to the significant biosecurity risks posed by county fairs, most people working in the US swine industry do not participate in such events. Given the near annual occurrence of human agricultural fair-acquired influenza cases, one wonders whether the risks of showing any influenza-susceptible animals at such events are truly worth the rewards, for the animals or the humans. - Mod.JH ", "dates": ["Date: Fri 21 Jul 2017", "last week [week of 9-15 Jul 2017]", "the hog barn on [Thu 13 Jul 2017] after swine flu was detected in a", "org/post/20170717", "5180499]", "On [Fri 14 Jul 2017] Clinton County Health Commissioner Pamela Walker", "Also [Fri 14 Jul 2017] state officials said nearly 50 hogs at another", "removed from the Franklin County Fair on [Wed 19 Jul 2017] for", "week [week of 9-15 Jul 2017] ordered approximately 300 hogs", "The A/H3N2v viruses were first identified in US pigs in 2010", "and September 2016 364 human H3N2v cases were reported from 14", " The largest outbreak occurred in 2012 when a total of 309", "[Since H3N2 viruses first appeared in pigs in 1998 there have been", "protein from the H1N1 2009 pandemic virus"], "title": "Influenza, swine - USA (04): (OH) H3N2, human cases susp\r\n\t"}, "358": {"sentences": "   Sun 23 Jul 2017 Source: UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), ReliefWeb edited The Ministry of Health and Medical Services (MHMS) has been working closely with the Ministry of Education and World Health Organization (WHO) to address the recent outbreak of meningococcal disease in a boarding school in the Eastern health division 1.

Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.

Travelers considering pregnancy  Talk to your health care provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you&rsquo;re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Wait at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.

Health sector response  On Wednesday, 6 August and Thursday, 7 August, an Emergency Committee was held via teleconference to determine whether the current outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. After discussion and deliberation on the information provided, the Committee advised that:  the Ebola outbreak in West Africa constitutes an \u2018extraordinary event\u2019 and a public health risk to other States;  the possible consequences of further international spread are particularly serious in view of the virulence of the virus, the intensive community and health facility transmission patterns, and the weak health systems in the currently affected and most at-risk countries.  a coordinated international response is deemed essential to stop and reverse the international spread of Ebola.  It was the unanimous view of the Committee that the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have been met. The entire statement, including a list of temporary recommendations, can be found at http://who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2014/ebola-20140808/en/.  On Friday, 8 August, the Director-General, Dr Margaret Chan, gave a press briefing to the international media from WHO Headquarters. Dr Chan will give an additional briefing on the situation of the outbreak and the ongoing response in the region to the Permanent and Observer Missions to the United Nations and other international organizations in Geneva on Tuesday, 12 August. Permanent Representatives of the affected countries have been invited to speak on behalf of their respective Governments on the national Ebola response and priorities.  On Monday, 11 August, WHO will convene a panel of medical ethics experts to begin looking at the use of experimental treatments in the ongoing EVD outbreak in West Africa. At this time, there are no registered medicines or vaccines against this deadly virus; several experimental options are currently under development, though. The recent treatment of two health workers from US faith-based aid organizations has raised questions about whether medicines that have never been tested or shown to be safe in humans should be used in outbreak situations. In the case of Ebola, supplies are extremely limited, which then raises questions about who should receive it, if it\u2019s used.  Disease update  New cases and deaths attributable to EVD continue to be reported by the Ministries of Health in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. Between 5 and 6 August 2014, 68 new cases (laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspect cases) of EVD and 29 deaths were reported from the four countries as follows: Guinea, 0 new cases and 4 deaths; Liberia, 38 new cases and 12 deaths; Nigeria, 4 new cases and 1 death; and Sierra Leone, 26 new cases and 12 deaths.  As of 6 August 2014, the cumulative number of cases attributed to EVD in the four countries stands at 1 779, including 961 deaths. The distribution and classification of the cases are as follows: Guinea, 495 cases (355 confirmed, 133 probable, and 7 suspected), including 367 deaths; Liberia, 554 cases (148 confirmed, 274 probable, and 132 suspected), including 294 deaths; Nigeria, 13 cases (0 confirmed, 7 probable, and 6 suspected), including 2 deaths; and Sierra Leone, 717 cases (631 confirmed, 38 probable, and 48 suspected), including 298 deaths.

The 47 year old male patient in Xiangxi was known to have had exposure to a live poultry market. He became unwell on Wed 9 Aug 2017 and subsequently passed away on Sun 13 Aug 2017. Travellers to mainland China or other affected areas must avoid visiting wet markets, live poultry markets or farms. They should be alert to the presence of backyard poultry when visiting relatives and friends. They should also avoid purchasing live or freshly slaughtered poultry, and avoid touching poultry/birds or their droppings. They should strictly observe personal and hand hygiene when visiting any place with live poultry. Travellers returning from affected areas should consult a doctor promptly if symptoms develop, and inform the doctor of their travel history for prompt diagnosis and treatment of potential diseases. It is essential to tell the doctor if they have seen any live poultry during travel, which may imply possible exposure to contaminated environments. This will enable the doctor to assess the possibility of avian influenza and arrange necessary investigations and appropriate treatment in a timely manner. While local surveillance, prevention and control measures are in place, the CHP will remain vigilant and work closely with the World Health Organization and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments. The CHP's Port Health Office conducts health surveillance measures at all boundary control points. Thermal imaging systems are in place for body temperature checks on inbound travellers. Suspected cases will be immediately referred to public hospitals for follow-up. The display of posters and broadcasting of health messages in departure and arrival halls as health education for travellers is under way. The travel industry and other stakeholders are regularly updated on the latest information. The public should maintain strict personal, hand, food and environmental hygiene and take heed of the advice below if handling poultry: - avoid touching poultry, birds, animals or their droppings; - when buying live chickens, do not touch them and their droppings. Do not blow at their bottoms. Wash eggs with detergent if soiled with faecal matter and cook and consume them immediately; - always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling chickens and eggs; - eggs should be cooked well until the white and yolk become firm. Do not eat raw eggs or dip cooked food into any sauce with raw eggs; - poultry should be cooked thoroughly. If there is pinkish juice running from the cooked poultry or the middle part of its bone is still red, the poultry should be cooked again until fully done; - wash hands frequently, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, before handling food or eating, and after going to the toilet, touching public installations or equipment such as escalator handrails, elevator control panels or door knobs, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing; and - wear a mask if fever or respiratory symptoms develop, when going to a hospital or clinic, or while taking care of patients with fever or respiratory symptoms.  communicated by: ProMED-mail The continuing reports of human cases merit active surveillance and more awareness efforts for high-risk groups and the general public. - Mod.UBA   .

NCDC and partners are providing onsite support in Ondo and Plateau State 1.5.12. States are enjoined to intensify surveillance and promote Infection, Prevention and Control (IPC) measures in health facilities. Once again, ProMED-mail thanks Dr Olutayo Olajide Babalobi for sending in the Epidemiological Report above. As noted in earlier comments, Lassa fever remains a problem in Nigeria because the virus is endemic there. Virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or their excreta. Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients. Images of mastomys mice, the rodent reservoir of Lass fever virus, can be seen at . - Mod.TY ", "dates": ["Date: Fri 11 Aug 2017", "Plateau - 1) in week 30 2017 compared with 14 suspected cases with

The infected horses on the property in Finney County will be euthanized because there is no cure and there is a risk the animals may infect other horses. The Kansas Department of Agriculture's Division of Animal Health was told this month August 2017 of the initial positive test for the disease, also known as Swamp fever. The horse facility was quarantined and all the exposed horses were tested, with 5 additional positive cases detected. The remaining horses at the facility will be observed and retested in 60 days. Equine infectious anemia is most commonly spread by biting flies and ticks, or sometimes through the shared used of blood-contaminated instruments or needles. The disease does not affect people, but it can be spread to horses, mules and donkeys. The virus attacks the immune system, with signs including bleeding in mucus membranes and a gradual loss of condition and muscle weakness. Other signs include fever, depression and anemia. Infected horses can run a low-grade fever or become lethargic, but often there are no clinical signs. Infected horses continue to carry the virus and can be the source of further infections, hence the protocol to euthanize infected animals. All infected horses, including those who have no signs, are carriers of the disease. There is no vaccine or treatment. There are typically a small number of cases in the United States every year, although the disease is common in other parts of the world. The disease is controlled in the US by regular testing before horses are allowed to travel across state lines and/or to shows. The pathogen causing the disease is categorized as a lentivirus: it contains genetic RNA material, which it uses to produce DNA. This DNA is then incorporated into the genetic makeup of infected cells. The disease was first identified in France in 1843 and first tentatively diagnosed in the United States in 1888. How sad that this disease continues and there is no vaccine for it. We pour millions into other research projects, some of which seem to have little usefulness, but why no vaccine? \"Under natural conditions, the most important mode of transmission of equine infectious anemia (EIA) is by the transfer of virus-infective blood by blood-feeding insects between horses in close proximity. Virus is found free in the plasma or cell associated, principally in monocytes and macrophages of infected animals. Although infection is considered primarily blood borne, all tissues and body fluids are potentially infectious, especially during episodes of clinical disease when viral burdens are high. Transmission of EIA by biting flies is purely mechanical; the virus does not replicate in the vector. The chance of transmission of EIA is directly proportional to the volume of blood retained on the mouthparts of the insect after feeding. In that respect, horse flies, deer flies, and to a lesser extent, stable flies are likely the most efficient vectors. It is also because they are capable of triggering host defensive behavior that interrupts feeding and results in their seeking a new susceptible host to complete their blood meal.\" Fly control is very important, in the barn and on the animal. Currently there is no vaccine for EIA in the US. There is a vaccine developed in China and used in other places (see: Equine infectious anemia - USA (04): (KY) unlicensed vaccine http://promedmail.org/post/20150915.3645562).

UNICEF and its partners continue to respond to humanitarian needs including in hurricane-affected areas. Achievements in the 1st half of 2017 include the following: The number of suspected cases of cholera continue to decline nationally with 7626 cases reported up to Fri 30 Jun 2017 compared to over 21 000 in the same period in 2016. This indicates that the efforts made toward ensuring effective coordination increased the number of rapid response teams that achieved progress towards the goal of eliminating cholera in Haiti. A total of 120 schools damaged by the hurricane have been rehabilitated, facilitating the return to class for more than 30 000 students. Up to 139 schools received over 10 000 items of school furniture, and 26 000 children received psychosocial support. Over 550 000 people benefited from access to safe water. Situation in Numbers  - 3 200 000 Total people affected (OCHA-HNO)  - 1 100 000 # of children in need of humanitarian assistance (UNICEF)  - 1 600 000 # of adults in need of humanitarian assistance (OCHA-HNO)  - 7626 suspected cholera cases and 87 fatalities (MSPP - 1 Jan to 1 Jul 2017)  - 12 000 # of children in situation of vulnerability (UNICEF, OCHA-HNO) Situation Overview and Humanitarian Needs: Thu 1 Jun 2017 marked the official start of the 2017 hurricane season in Haiti. The rainy season that began in April 2017 has resulted in floods and landslides, damage to homes and destruction of harvests, especially in the departments of South, Grand'Anse and Nippes, which were the most affected departments by hurricane Matthew. Erosion of roads have impacted access to several communes, especially in the South department. The rainy season will coincide with the hurricane season, which will affect Haiti, usually lasting until 30 November. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) indicated to a 70 percent probability of 11 to 17 storms, of which 5 to 9 could become hurricane including 2 to 4 major ones of category 3 to 5. Despite the strong rainfall since April 2017, the trend of cholera continues to decline at the national level and is currently at its lowest level since the beginning of the epidemic largely due to effective coordination and increased number of rapid response teams. This presents an opportunity to accelerate elimination of the disease sooner than expected. However, cholera efforts are severely underfunded.

Bowyer said the disease poses no threat to humans or their pets, and will not affect the deer population or the upcoming deer season. Byline: Marc Thomas  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. This report is not as yet backed up by a news release on the Missouri Department of Conservation website ( ). While epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHD or EHDV) is closely related to bluetongue virus, the viruses are antigenically very different. EHD more often affects cervids. Bluetongue virus more often affects cattle. While either virus can and occasionally does cross into the other species, it is much more likely that EHD is the cause of these animals dying. We would appreciate receiving some testing information. Dr William Wilson has developed a PCR test that clearly demonstrates the differences between these 2 viruses. Hemorrhagic disease (HD), caused by viruses in either the EHDV or bluetongue virus (BTV) groups (Reoviridae: _Orbivirus_), is the most important viral disease affecting white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) in the United States. In North America there are 3 subtypes of EHD virus (EHDV 1, 2, and 6), and 5 subtypes of BT virus (BTV 2, 10, 11, 13, and 17). Isolated cases of BT viruses from infected deer were first reported in 1968, although white-tailed deer mortalities consistent with EHD/BT disease were noted as early as 1886. Bluetongue is an insect-transmitted, viral disease of sheep, cattle, goats, and other ruminants, such as white-tailed deer and pronghorn. It is particularly damaging in sheep; half the sheep in an infected flock may die. In cattle and goats, however, bluetongue viruses cause very mild, self-limiting infections with only minor clinical consequences. A bluetongue virus infection causes inflammation, swelling, and hemorrhage of the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, and tongue. Inflammation and soreness of the feet also are associated with bluetongue. In sheep, the tongue and mucous membranes of the mouth become swollen, hemorrhagic, and may look red or dirty blue in color, thus giving the disease its name: bluetongue. Bluetongue is a seasonal disease generally observed in the late summer and early fall in the United States. Virus transmission begins in the early spring with the onset of insect flight activity and continues until the 1st hard frosts. Bluetongue viruses are spread from animal to animal by biting gnats. In the United States, the disease is most prevalent in the southern and south western states. It is almost non-existent in the upper north-central and north eastern states, where biting flies do not appear able to transmit the viruses. Animals cannot directly contract the disease from other animals. For more information go to  . This suspect report has been posted more because it provides a warning to other states to expect to see such cases in deer from now on. Usually EHD precedes BT outbreaks which are delayed by a measure of cross immunity from EHDv infections. Bluetongue may appear mild in livestock but it regularly results in pregnant cattle losing their embryos/foetuses and returning to service. In Louisiana we find teratogenic BTV infections related to 'dummy calves' which are unable to suckle.

The majority of cases are from towns located in the northern part of the Cusco Region, which is situated in the Amazon rainforest.  Most cases (79%) were detected in January, with only 7% and 14% of the cases being identified in February and March, respectively. To date, there have been no fatalities and all cases have recovered following symptomatic treatment.  In February 2016, a field mission to the Madre de Dios Region conducted jointly by the MoH of Peru and PAHO/WHO revealed a mixed outbreak of dengue (DENV-2) and Oropouche viruses. While Madre de Dios already experienced an outbreak of Oropouche fever in 1994, at the time of the mission in February, this latest outbreak was of a higher magnitude (120 confirmed cases).  Public health response  Peruvian health authorities have implemented the following public health measures:  providing medical treatment to the cases;  conducting epidemiological and entomological investigations;  strengthening vector control.  WHO risk assessment  Cases of infection with Oropouche virus have already been reported in the past in Peru. However, it is the first time that the Cusco Region records cases of Oropouche fever. It will be critical to establish whether the competent vector, the Culicoides paraensis midge, is present in Cusco as that could provide some explanation for the emergence of the disease in this specific area. At present, the possibility of further cases being detected in the Cusco Region and in the rest of Peru cannot be excluded. Given the wide geographical distribution of the competent vector in the Region of the Americas, the risk of cases being identified in other countries is significant. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessments based on the latest available information.  WHO advice  Given its clinical presentation, Oropouche fever should be included in the clinical differential diagnosis for other common arboviral diseases (e.g., chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever, Zika virus).  The proximity of midge vector breeding to human habitation is a significant risk factor for Oropouche virus infection. Prevention and control relies on reducing the breeding of midges through source reduction (removal and modification of breeding sites) and reducing contact between midges and people. This can be achieved by reducing the number of natural and artificial water-filled habitats that support midge larvae, reducing the adult midge populations around at-risk communities and by using barriers such as insect screens, closed doors and windows, long clothing and repellents.  Background  Oropouche fever is caused by the Oropouche virus. In humans, it is transmitted primarily through the bite of the Culicoides paraensis midge. No direct transmission of the virus from human to human has been documented.  Oropouche fever causes symptoms similar to those of dengue with an incubation period of 4-8 days (range: 3-12 days). Symptoms include the sudden onset of high fever, headache, myalgia, joint pain, and vomiting. In some patients it can cause clinical symptoms of aseptic meningitis.  In the Americas, outbreaks of Oropouche fever virus have been reported from rural and urban communities of Brazil, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, and Trinidad and Tobago.

During a survey for pests and diseases of avocado (_Persea americana_) conducted in October 2014, a wilt disease was observed in the Tuanggyi on avocado orchards and in Ywangan both districts in Shan Region on avocado trees used as shade plants in coffee (_Coffea arabica_) plantations. In both districts, symptoms were observed on _P. americana_ and not on any other tree species. Affected trees showed sapwood discoloration, leaf necrosis and defoliation, and usually died within a month or two following the onset of symptoms. Laboratory analysis conducted in the USA under quarantine facilities (PCR, pathogenicity tests) confirmed the identity of the fungus. The insect vector, _Xyleborus glabratus_ (Coleoptera: Scolytidae)EPPO Alert List, is known to occur in Myanmar.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail Laurel wilt (LW) is a vascular disease affecting species in the family _Lauraceae_. It is caused by a fungus, _Raffaelea lauricola_, newly described in 2008. LW is spread by the redbay ambrosia beetle (_Xyleborus glabratus_), which is native to India, Japan, Myanmar and Taiwan. Root-to-root spread of the fungus within tree stands is also suspected. LW symptoms may include wilting and discolouration of twigs and leaves, as well as black streaks in the wood of branches and trunks. Infected trees die. Disease management relies on exclusion of both vector and fungus from new areas but may also include phytosanitation and removal of pathogen and vector reservoirs. LW is considered a serious threat to avocado cultivation. For example, in the US, it has destroyed tens of thousands of avocado trees already and continues to spread (ProMED-mail post http://promedmail.org/post/20160516.4225817). It has been suggested that fungus and beetle were introduced into that country with wooden materials. Sniffer dogs are being trialled to detect pre-symptomatic trees in order to slow down the spread of the fungus. In their native environment, including Myanmar, fungus and beetle do not devastate native tree species, but are part of a balanced biosystem where hosts and pathogens have evolved together. However, avocado as an alien host species is highly susceptible to the disease there.

Last year 2016, 122 locals were found to have the disease. There are also 7 cases of the Barmah Forest virus but no reports of malaria or chikungunya, all of which mosquitoes spread. Across Queensland, there have been 1830 mozzie-borne mosquito-borne virus infections reported in the past 7 months, compared to 2462 for the whole of 2016. To control mosquitoes, Rockhampton Regional Council checks properties for infestations, mists adult mosquitoes, and monitors saltmarsh and fresh water areas with environmentally-friendly treatments.

The council has placed a large emphasis on educating the community around best practice to control mosquitoes including reducing the number of breeding sites around the home and using measures such as mosquito nets, coils, repellents, and light-coloured clothing to reduce the risk of being bitten.\" Ross River virus is Australia's main mosquito-borne disease. There is no vaccine and it costs the Australian economy more than AUD 20 million about USD 15.9 million a year to detect. The main treatment for the disease is anti-inflammatory medications.

Prof Aaskov said transmission of the disease in our region was most likely human-mosquito-human rather than animal-mosquito-human. \"At the moment, the only way to stop the disease is to cover yourself up and some of the sunscreens have mosquito repellents in them,\" he said. A pair of thongs, stubbies shorts, and a singlet sleeveless garment with a low-cut neck are not going to protect you from mosquitoes. Really, all we can do is avoid getting mosquito bites.\" Queensland Health urged those with symptoms to ask their doctor for a blood test. \"Management of the illness generally involves treatment of the symptoms and most people recover without lasting effects,\" a spokesman said. \"Your doctor will advise on treatment for joint and muscle pains. \"If diagnosed with a mosquito-borne disease such as Ross River fever, it is also important to prevent being bitten by mosquitoes so your illness is not passed on to someone else.\" A new treatment for Ross River fever is being trialled in Queensland and Victoria. If successful, pentosan polysulfate sodium could be used to significantly reduce the duration and severity of joint pain caused by the virus that has infected 85 Central Queensland residents this year 2017.<br><br><strong> At a glance -</strong><br> - Ross River virus is spread by mosquitoes from infected animals or humans. - Only female mosquitoes can pass on the disease. - It is prevalent in about 20 species of mosquito. - Children who get the disease have less severe symptoms than adults. - Symptoms take 2-9 days to develop. - Symptoms can last for 40 weeks and include fever chills, muscle aches, rashes, fatigue, aching tendons, swollen lymph nodes, headaches, and extreme joint pain. - Once you have been infected you become immune to the disease. - It is diagnosed by a blood test. - People cannot spread the virus to other people. - The treatment is limited to pain killers and anti-inflammatories. - There is no vaccine available in Australia. Byline: Sherele Moody  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. As noted in previous comments, Ross River virus RRV infections occur sporadically across Australia when rains are heavy. RRV infection cases also occur at times in New South wales, Victoria, and Western Australia. Common symptoms include fever, joint pain, and feeling tired and generally unwell. There are no effective treatments available for RRV. While most people recover after 2-3 weeks, some cases are very serious and can leave lingering problems such as arthritis in small joints, like those in the hands and feet, that can persist for weeks, making normal movement difficult. Ross River virus is a zoonotic alphavirus transmitted by a wide range of mosquitoes, including _Aedes_ and _Culex_ species. The recommendation to avoid mosquito bites is prudent and should be adopted by individuals living in or visiting hot spots where transmission is occurring. Barmah Forest virus is also an alphavirus. Dr Steve Berger provided comments on background on Barmah Forest disease BFD in Australia abstracted from Gideon ( ) and the Gideon e-book series. Barmah Forest disease virus was first isolated from mosquitoes (_Culex annulirostris_) in the Barmah Forest, Northern Victoria in 1974. Human infection was subsequently reported along the south coast of New South Wales during the mid-1980's; in Queensland during 1988-1989; in the Northern Territory in 1992, and in southwestern Western Australia in 1993. A new focus was described in Gippsland (Victoria) during 1993-1994. The number of localities reporting Barmah Forest disease increased during 1996-1998, and again during 1999-2001. Disease incidence has increased somewhat since 2000, with most cases reported from Queensland and New South Wales. - Mod.TY ", "dates": ["Date: Sun 23 Jul 2017 10:57 AM AEST", "Last year [2016] 122 locals were found to have the disease", "virus infections reported in the past 7 months compared to 2462 for", "Wales during the mid-1980's; in Queensland during 1988-1989; in the", "1993-1994", "increased during 1996-1998 and again during 1999-2001"], "title": "Ross River & Barmah Forest viruses - Australia: (QL)\r\n\t"}, "744": {"sentences": "   Mon 28 Aug 2017 Source: Diario Aysen in Spanish, trans. Mod.JG, edited Last weekend, more than 20 children with severe respiratory symptoms were admitted to the Regional Hospital, and they were diagnosed with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. During the last week, 2 3-year-old children with severe respiratory illness were admitted to the intensive care unit, and one of them was waiting to be referred to Puerto Montt. Therefore, with information updated until last Sat 26 Aug 2017, more than 30 children with RSV infection have been reported, and all of them are hospitalized in pediatrics, pediatric intensive care, and neonatal intensive care units. Meanwhile, because of the severity of their condition  most of them being infants  7 children have been referred to hospitals in Santiago and Concepcion so they may receive adequate care, since Coyhaique Regional Hospital (CRH) does not have a pediatric intensive care unit (ICU). This is what Dr. Jaime Lopez-Quintana, Head of the CRH reported: \"This year 2017, RSV is behaving quite aggressively, and our adult intensive care unit is completely full with children. This is not an adequate condition for taking care of these children; this is not what our children in this region deserve,\" as he reported this situation to Ms. Gisela Alarcon-Rojas, Subsecretary of Healthcare Networks of the Chilean Ministry of Health, who verified the condition of children being taken care of in the (adult) ICU. So, with this complex situation, Dr. Lopez-Quintana added that specialists from important children referral centers, particularly from Dr. Luis Calvo-Mackenna and Dr. Exequiel Fernandez-Cortes hospitals, will soon arrive to this region. \"We hope to have for the next 2 weeks the support of pediatricians trained in intensive medicine who may help the team we have here in Coyhaique,\" emphasized Dr. Lopez-Quintana. According to information brought by the medical sub-direction from the Coyhaique Regional Hospital, the affected children are hospitalized in the following areas: pediatrics, neonatal intensive care unit, and (general) intensive care unit. There are 10 infants hospitalized in the pediatrics service, while another 11 children have already been discharged; so now there are 14 beds available. In the neonatal ICU, 7 children are hospitalized; 2 of them are severely ill, and the capacity of the unit is 2 beds; while in the general ICU, 6 infants are hospitalized, and there are 2 beds available. \"With respect to bed availability, the hospital is still able to cope with the situation. However, a working overload for the personnel has been observed, so that extra personnel have been recruited to cover the work shifts,\" explained Dr. Joaquin Garcia-Gay, Medical Subdirector of the CRH. Also, Dr. Garcia-Gay explained that if a child develops a febrile illness, respiratory distress, intercostal retraction and malaise for 2 days, these are some of the symptoms that may indicate the presence of RSV, which mainly affects infants less than 2 years old. \"So, if such symptoms occur, then the child must be brought to the Urgency Service. However, for those patients that develop mild respiratory symptoms, such as common cold or other similar conditions, it is preferable they are not brought to the Urgency Service, since they may be at risk for becoming infected with RSV from patients that are being hospitalized,\" the specialist advised.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Most infants are infected before one year of age, and virtually everyone gets an RSV infection by 2 years of age. Each year, on average, in the United States, RSV leads to: - 57 527 hospitalizations among children younger than 5 years old - 2.1 million outpatient visits among children younger than 5 years old - 177 000 hospitalizations and 14 000 deaths among adults older than 65 years. In the United States and other areas with similar climates, RSV infections occur primarily during fall, winter, and spring  . It is currently winter in Chile. It is not clear what may have led to this current RSV outbreak in Chile. In 2001, an outbreak of RSV struck Santiago, Chile. 150 hospital admissions were registered daily during the height of the southern hemisphere winter. It was speculated that pollution may have played a role as Santiago is one of the world's most polluted cities. Chile's geography of surrounding mountains and heat inversions in winter dramatically increases the concentration of pollutants. Pollution leads to irritation of the respiratory tract making it more difficult for the immune system to respond to infections. (Excerpted from C Orellana.

The agency noted that the intoxicated suffered from suffocation, dizziness and nausea caused by the effects of aluminum phosphide that was spread in the factory. Public Health also reported that the Fire Department was mobilized to the site and the National Health Service and the National Police, which, along with neighbors, transferred the affected to various care centers in the area. Doctors at the Toribio Bencosme hospital in Moca said that some of the patients told them that they began to feel ill when other workers at the company Inetab-Kaubeck fumigated with a substance used to dry tobacco leaves. Electronic media in the city of Moca claimed that more than 80 women were affected and that factory executives refused to provide information. At least 6 of the women were admitted to the hospital in critical condition, and almost all of them will remain under observation for at least the next 24 hours.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. \"Aluminum phosphide (AlP  Al is for aluminum and P is for phosphide) is a highly toxic, low cost, effective, and commonly used pesticide, a fumigant for control of insects and rodents. It is primarily used for indoor fumigation of raw agricultural commodities, animal feeds, processed food commodities, and non-food commodities in sealed containers or structures, and for outdoor fumigation of burrows to control rodents and moles in non-domestic areas, non-cropland, and agricultural areas. Aluminum and magnesium phosphide are formulated as tablets, pellets, impregnated materials and dusts. Aluminum and magnesium phosphide are restricted use chemicals. The use by certified pesticide applicators (at least in the USA) with respect to rodent control for burrows at least 15 feet (4.6 m) from a residential structure is considered a residential use. Aluminum and magnesium phosphide react with moisture in the atmosphere to produce phosphine gas, which is the substance that is active as a pesticide. It liberates lethal phosphine gas when it comes in contact either with atmospheric moisture or with hydrochloric acid in the stomach. The release of phosphine gas from AlP is immediate when mixed with aqueous solutions, such as water, and leads to rapid absorption through the lungs and gut when swallowed. Its gaseous form and toxicity makes it a potential agent for chemical terrorism. Unfortunately, AlP is now one of the most common causes of pesticide poisoning among agricultural workers. The mechanism of toxicity includes cellular hypoxia due to the effect on mitochondria, inhibition of cytochrome C oxidase, and formation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals. The signs and symptoms are nonspecific and instantaneous. The toxicity of AlP particularly affects the cardiac and vascular tissues, which manifest as profound and refractory hypotension, congestive heart failure, and electrocardiographic abnormalities. The diagnosis of AlP usually depends on clinical suspicion or history, but can be made easily by the simple silver nitrate test on gastric content or on breath. Due to no known specific antidote, management remains primarily supportive care. Aluminum and magnesium phosphide are in Toxicity Category I, the highest (most toxic) of 4 categories, for acute effects via the inhalation route. No significant exposure to phosphine gas is expected via dermal routes, although rarely dermal absorption has been the route of lethal exposures. The Environmental Protection Agency does not believe that aluminum and magnesium phosphide pose a carcinogenic concern. Histopathological findings of vital organs were found to be suggestive of cellular hypoxia. Myocardial muscles in non-survivors showed myocyte vacuolation, areas of myocytolysis and degeneration. Histological changes on human brain showed disorganisation of the different layers, paucity of glial cells, degeneration of neurons, and appearance of necrotic patches. In other organs like in lung, diffuse vessel injury with edema and atelectasis; in liver, centrilobular necrosis; and in kidney, tubular degeneration findings may be present. The permissible exposure limit of phosphine is less than 0.3 ppm in the working environment and levels greater than 50 ppm are dangerous to life, while at 400-600 ppm it is lethal within half an hour. Individuals working in the manufacturing facility of AlP or methamphetamine (phosphine is a by-product), engaged in placing AlP tablets on the stacks of grains, and in the vicinity of application are at risk for unintentional exposure of phosphine gas, with few reported fatalities. Cases have existed in animals fed grain that was exposed to phosphine tablets but not allowed to sit for long enough prior to being fed to the animals. Animals have died in all of these cases.\" This is a sad situation, but it may indicate that the plant needs more attention to safety. We sincerely hope the workers recover.

Doctors said the other 2 patients had not shown any symptoms, though one of them died of a brain haemorrhage after undergoing surgery earlier this month July 2017. While the globally unprecedented case put the focus on the city's current blood donation policy, which does not require testing for JE, health officials ruled out changing the system. University of Hong Kong microbiologist Professor Yuen Kwok-yung said there was no need to start screening blood donations for JE as the chance of infection was very low. \"This is a very rare and unfortunate case,\" he said, adding that the lung transplant operation could have made the patient more vulnerable to the JE virus. \"From a medical point of view, I don't see the need to develop a mass screening test, unless there is a surge in the cases of JE virus infection in Hong Kong.\" There have been only 3 cases of the disease so far this year 2017, and only one in 100 infected people show symptoms such as headache, high fever and neck stiffness, usually between 4-14 days after contracting the virus. It may lead to a swelling of the brain and death. Yuen added that it was practically impossible to check the Red Cross blood bank for the JE virus, and there was no need for public alarm. \"I hope this case won't discourage the general public from donating blood in future,\" he said. Dr Lee Cheuk-kwong of the Red Cross suggested that in addition to filling in questionnaires regarding their health, donors should report any symptom of illness after giving blood. Investigations revealed that the donor, a 46-year-old man living in Tin Shui Wai and working in Kwun Tong, had given blood through the Red Cross mobile donation service on 29 May 2017. He had passed all required health tests and showed no symptoms of JE. The donor had visited London in May 2017, but could not recall whether he had been bitten by mosquitoes. Centre for Health Protection controller Dr Wong Ka-hing said there was a very high chance he had been infected locally. The patient suffering from brain haemorrhage received the infected blood on 20 Jun 2017, and died after surgery on 4 Jul 2017 due to bleeding. He was not tested for JE, but did not show symptoms of the virus infection either. Another patient being treated for leukaemia at Queen Mary underwent a transfusion with the infected blood on 2 Jun 2017, but was discharged on 14 Jul 2017 without showing any JE symptoms.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Rapporteur Mary Marshall Transmission of JE virus via blood transmission is a rare event, indeed. Human viremias are of low magnitude and of short duration. The donor was probably early in the viremic phase and probably had no fever. Because this is such a rare event, it doubtless explains why there is reluctance to undergo the cost and efforts needed to screen blood and blood products for JEV. - Mod.TY ", "dates": ["Date: Sat 22

Language:  Select  Espa&ntilde;ol  What is the current situation?  Zika virus (or Zika) has been reported in Saba. Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in Saba are infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:  Women who are pregnant:  Do not travel to Saba.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to Saba or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers considering pregnancy:  Before you or your partner travel, talk to your health care provider about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection.  Wait before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.  If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex &ndash; or do not have sex &ndash; for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More Zika information for pregnant women  2.

None of the horses were vaccinated against the disease. \"Vaccination is the best protection horse owners have for their animals,\" State Veterinarian Dr JJ Goicoechea said. \"With the increased numbers of mosquitoes this year 2017, it's important all horse owners take this precaution to prevent the spread of disease.\" Arboviral diseases like West Nile are transmitted to humans primarily through the bites of infected mosquito, ticks, sand flies, or midges. Every year, the state closely monitors several arboviral diseases to protect public health and safety and the agriculture industry. In addition to West Nile, the Animal Disease Laboratory tests for 2 other prevalent arboviral diseases: Saint Louis encephalitis virus and western equine encephalitis virus. Although these diseases cannot be transmitted from a horse, all 3 can cause severe illness and death both in horses and humans. \"Vaccinations, in conjunction with practices that reduce exposure to mosquito, are very effective in protecting horses from WNV,\" Goicoechea said. \"It's not too late to prevent the spread of disease.\" West Nile has been prevalent in Nevada since 2004 while the other 2 diseases have been widespread in the Western United States for decades. Since the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito has been found in Southern Nevada this year, the laboratory also monitors and tests for Zika Virus. All Nevada residents should take precautions such as eliminating mosquito-breeding sites around houses and barns, using insect repellents to fight the bite and keeping horses vaccinated against these 3 diseases. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ Vaccination is important. West Nile virus (WNV) is usually combined with eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) and tetanus. Sometimes the WNV and EEE are also combined with western equine encephalitis as well as tetanus. A lot of bang for the buck for protecting your equine friend. St Louis encephalitis (SLE) is known to infect horses, but it is very rare that it produces disease in horses. One of the 1st reported cases was in Brazil with neurological signs. Virus isolation was detailed in a November 2013 study ( ). A 2nd article was published in The Horse in August 2014 ( ). I am unaware of a St Louis encephalitis vaccine for horses and after calling several distributors and checking some websites for a vaccine for horses, I found none. - Mod.TG ", "dates": ["Date: Wed 16 Aug 2017 7:56 AM EDT", "The Office of the State Veterinarian said [Tue 15 Aug 2017] the", "on [6 Aug 2016] and was euthanized days later when it was no longer", "Date: Thu 17 Aug 2017", "[Thu 17 Aug 2017]", "West Nile has been prevalent in Nevada since 2004 while the other 2", "A 2nd article was published in The Horse in August 2014"], "title": "West Nile virus - Americas (08): (DE,\r\n\tNV) equine "}, "682": {"sentences": "WHO | Links  Skip to main content  Access  Home Alt+0  Navigation Alt+1  Content Alt+2  Search  Search the  WHO .int site  Submit  Advanced search  Navigation  Home  Health topics  Data  Media centre  Publications  Countries  Programmes  Governance  About WHO  Language  \u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a  \u4e2d\u6587  English  Fran\u00e7ais  \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439  Espa\u00f1ol  Health workforce  Menu  Health workforce  Education and training  Governance and planning  Migration and retention  Nursing and midwifery  Statistics  Community-based health workers  Resource centre  News and events  Links  Links  This page provides links to web sites of selected national, regional and international agencies working on global health workforce issues.

Chipotle issued the following statement to StreetInsider.com: \"We are aware of a small number of reported illnesses isolated to a single restaurant in Sterling, Virginia on Tripleseven Road, and have notified local health department officials. We are working with health authorities to understand what the cause may be and to resolve the situation as quickly as possible. The reported symptoms are consistent with norovirus. Norovirus does not come from our food supply, and it is safe to eat at Chipotle. We plan to reopen the restaurant today Tue 18 Jul 2017. We take every report of illness seriously.

Worldwide, norovirus is the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach or intestines or both). About one in 5 cases of acute gastroenteritis, which leads to diarrhea and vomiting, is caused by norovirus ( ). Norovirus is more often the cause of acute gastroenteritis among people in developed countries. In developed countries, norovirus causes about one in 5 cases of acute gastroenteritis; in developing countries, it's about one in 6 cases. Overall, developing countries have more cases of acute gastroenteritis caused by different pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria. So, norovirus accounts for smaller fraction of all cases in these countries. With the widespread use of rotavirus vaccine, norovirus has surpassed rotavirus as the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis for which children need medical care in some countries, like the United States and Nicaragua. This trend is likely to continue as other countries routinely vaccinate against rotavirus. Norovirus infections and outbreaks are usually more common in cooler, winter months. About half of all cases occur from December through February in countries above the equator and June through August in countries below the equator. However, in places closer to the equator, norovirus may be less seasonal. This may be because of temperature or the timing of the rainy season, but may also be associated with the birth rate. - Mod.LL   .

On 20 Aug 2017, the ministry received blood samples of 2 patients from Kiboga and Nakaseke hospital suspected Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF). According to a 21 Aug 2017 statement signed by the acting Director General, health services Dr Anthony Mbonye, the 2 victims tested positive to Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever CCFH. CCHF is a common disease among humans and animals caused by caused by a tick-borne virus (_Nairovirus_); the virus causes severe viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 percent. Dr Mbonye says that the general supportive care with treatment of symptoms is the main approach to managing CCFH among humans. The statement warns that while its symptoms do not appear in the infected animal, it appears in a very dangerous way in human beings. \"You are required to work with the office of the District Veterinary Officer to strengthen measures against CCHF control in animals, implement interventions to reduce the risk of CCHF infections among humans, and interventions to control CCFH in health care settings. You are also reminded to immediately report and investigate any CCFH suspected cases in your district,\" reads the statement in part signed by Dr Mbonye. CCHF virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. According to Ministry of health, the majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians and that human-to-human transmission occurs from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of infected persons. Hospital-acquired infections can also occur due to improper sterilization of medical equipment, reuse of needles, and contamination of medical supplies. Records indicate that since 2000, Uganda has experienced repeated outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF). Ebola VHF outbreak occurred in the districts of Gulu in 2000, Bundibugyo, 2007, Luwero, 2011, Kibaale in July 2012, Luwero in November 2012. Marburg VHF was earlier reported in Ibanda in 2007.

CCHF is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and Asian countries south of the 50th parallel north  the geographical limit of the principal tick vector. The hosts of the CCHF virus include a wide range of wild and domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats. Animals become infected by the bite of infected ticks and the virus remains in their bloodstream for about one week after infection, allowing the tick-animal-tick cycle to continue when another tick bites. Although a number of tick genera are capable of becoming infected with CCHF virus, ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_ are the principal vector. The CCHF virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Human-to-human transmission is possible.

Children like him are already weakened by hunger and illness, but are now facing the threat of contracting cholera. The deadly disease is one of the fastest spreading in Somaliland and is claiming the lives of many, from the old to the very young. In some areas, 500 cases are reported each day. And quarantine tents have been put up to deal with the most severely ill until they can be housed on hospital wards. Cholera is a treatable disease contracted through drinking dirty water. But it is something much of Somaliland's 4.5 million population have had to resort to as they stand on the brink of starvation. With more than half their livestock wiped out and no rain for 3 years, people consume whatever water they can find, even if it is contaminated by human waste or rotting animal carcasses. ITV News also spoke to a father who has lost 3 of his children to cholera, \"a father who had to bury 3 young children, who were only yesterday 6 Aug 2017 calling me dad and playing with me.\" That is what has driven him to educate others about cholera so that they don't have to go through the devastation he has. Authorities have rushed to put together teams of volunteers to go into communities to help people avoid contracting cholera. The disease  which has not been seen in developed countries like the UK for over 100 years  can easily be treated using an oral rehydration sachet. But without treatment, a person can quickly become dehydrated, go into shock and die. For the people of Somaliland, fighting disease is just one of their daily struggles while they wait for the rain to come and aid to arrive. The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are: - Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_; - Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam; - Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however, have suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be effective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and outbreak situations (63, 64).<br><br><strong> \"References </strong><br> 57.

According to a statement released by Lake County's Department of Water Resources, this is most likely the consequence of nutrients, cyanobacteria and warm water temperatures adversely affecting water quality, primarily dissolved oxygen. Fish rely on oxygen to breathe and process nutrients in their bodies. Warm water fish such as those living in Clear Lake need to have about 5 parts per million (ppm) dissolved oxygen to thrive. Like many other lakes in California, nationwide and around the world, Clear Lake has this summer been host to a large, dense, persistent cyanobacteria bloom (sometimes called blue-green algae). The bloom has been lake-wide with various intensities due to wind, water depth and nutrient cycling (phosphorus). These dense blooms produce ample oxygen during the day, but consume oxygen during the dark hours at night. Warm water conditions also contribute to the problem because warm water holds less dissolved gases (including oxygen) than cold water but warm water also increases the fish's metabolic rate. So the fish need more oxygen to digest and thrive, but the water cannot hold as much oxygen as it can in the spring, winter and fall months. According to the statement, at the current water temperatures of Clear Lake (80-84 F) 26-29 C, the dissolved oxygen saturation point is about 7.9 ppm. Recent monitoring by the California Department of Food and Agriculture has shown the dissolved oxygen concentration off the shores of Lakeport during the day have been as high as 30 ppm or more. At night, when the bacteria begin to respire or use oxygen, the dissolved oxygen concentrations plummet, bottoming out at 1 ppm or less. In the same area off Lakeport, the dissolved oxygen concentration dropped to near zero 17 nights between 5 Jul and 1 August 2017. \"These factors have come together in a perfect storm of sorts on Clear Lake  very warm water, dense cyanobacteria blooms, plenty of nutrients for the bacteria in the form of phosphorus from the landscape, wildly vacillating dissolved oxygen concentrations and fish that are already under stress in the warm water,\" the statement read. Cyanobacteria blooms may, at times, produce toxins that can adversely affect pets and people. For this reason Water Department personnel cautions people to avoid heavy algal scums in the water. Pets should not be allowed to swim in the lake as they may ingest the algae or scum. Caution should be exercised when young children interact with the water because they too may ingest the water and be more prone to adverse health effects due to their smaller body size. The department advises people to rinse off pets and people thoroughly with clean water after swimming and do not use raw lake water for cooking  boiling does not remove the toxins. Before eating fish from the lake, throw away the guts and thoroughly rinse the filets with tap or bottled water.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. The toxin may be present even if the algae are not, and likewise the algae may be present but the toxin may not be. However, safety for humans and animals means avoiding bodies of water with any blue-green algae. There are a number of blue-green algae, many of which are toxic, frequently resulting in rapid death for animals. Blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria, are a group of photosynthetic bacteria that many people refer to as 'pond scum.' Blue-green algae are most often blue-green in color, but can also be blue, green, reddish-purple, or brown. Blue-green algae generally grow in lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams when the water is warm and enriched with nutrients like phosphorus or nitrogen. Many different species of blue-green algae occur, but the most commonly detected include _Anabaena_ sp, _Aphanizomenon_ sp, _Microcystis_ sp, and _Planktothrix_ sp. It is not always the same species that blooms in a given water body, and the dominant species can change over the course of the season. Typical clinical signs in dogs exposed to blue-green algae include seizures, vomiting, and/or diarrhea after contact with surface water. Although the water appears clear, if a 'bloom' is just starting, it may be difficult to see any sheen, an early indication of blue-green algae formation. Some forms of blue-green algae may start forming slightly below the surface and may not be visible, but are just as toxic. One toxic alga frequently involved in illness and deaths is _Microcystis aeruginosa_, a single-celled blue green alga, or cyanobacterium, that occurs naturally in surface waters. Microcystis can proliferate to form dense blooms and mats under certain conditions. Many variants of these cyanobacteria produce multiple toxins, including the potent liver toxin microcystin. When microcystis die, their cells break open, releasing the toxin microcystin into the water. Ingestion of water or algal cells containing microcystin has produced adverse effects in fish, dogs, cats, livestock, and humans. Sometimes the mats and the sheen of the organisms are visible on the surface of the water, if it is a pond. In larger bodies of water, such as large lakes, it may be more difficult or impossible to see the sheen or the mat of accumulation. People swimming in dense microcystis blooms have experienced irritation such as skin rashes, burns, and blistering of the mouth. Ingestion or inhalation of water containing dense bloom material may cause vomiting, nausea, headaches, diarrhea, pneumonia, and fever. Ingestion of significant levels of the toxin microcystin can cause liver damage and dysfunction in humans and animals. No deaths from ingestion of microcystins have been reported in humans in the US; however, Brazil has reported human deaths. Dogs, wildlife, and livestock have died following exposure to this toxin. The most common route of exposure to microcystin is drinking water, followed by recreational exposures and food supplements. Typical water treatment processes do not fully remove microcystin that might be present in drinking water supplies stored in reservoirs. Swimming and playing in water that contains, or recently contained, microcystis blooms is another common exposure route. Children have the highest risk of exposure since they tend to unintentionally ingest water while swimming. Microcystin can move through the aquatic food web, exposing fish and shellfish, as well as the people who consume them. Microcystin does not remain in edible fish and shellfish tissues for more than a few weeks. However, people who frequently consume sport fish caught from a water body that supports microcystis blooms have a higher risk of exposure. Dogs can ingest large amounts of microcystis cells when they clean their coats after playing in water. Livestock, wildlife, and dogs are exposed through drinking water containing microcystis or through ingesting algal mats. A microscopic look at microcystin can be found at  and  .

Both associations urged the Ministry of Health to issue a statement and to publish the official information, since the data on the epidemic have not been updated for 8 months. In a statement, members of the health organizations reported that the cumulative number of suspected cases of diphtheria since September 2016 is 447, of which 123 correspond to 2017. Bolivar is one of the most affected states with 282 registered cases, equivalent to an increase of 63.08 percent, followed by Anzoategui (37 cases), Miranda (29), Monagas (26), Apure (19), Sucre (10), Capital District (9), and Zulia (8). In the other entities, 6 cases were reported in Cojedes, Vargas (5), Yaracuy (4), Merida (3), Trujillo (3), Barinas (2), Portuguesa (2), Carabobo (1), and Nueva Esparta (1), totaling 27 cases, representing 6.5 percent of the total. It is estimated that in 2016 there were at least 40 deaths from diphtheria, more than 30 of them reported just from Bolivar state. Other fatal cases were reported from 6 regions: Monagas (3), Anzoategui (2), Bol\u00edvar (1), and Sucre (1).

The Department of Health detected an outbreak in the housing development of Calicanto de Chiva (Valencia) affecting 6 people, 2 of whom remain hospitalized in the Hospital of Manises, although their condition is not serious. The origin of the outbreak, according to the 1st studies, could be in the development's water supply, which is being cleaned and chlorinated 1st thing today Wed 16 Aug 2017, says the Department of Health. Last Mon 14 Aug 2017 a meeting took place between members of the Chiva City Council, public health technicians, and representatives of the water management company, and it was decided to clean the reservoir and the affected facilities. First thing this morning Wed 16 Aug 2017, the water management company began emptying the tank, which is being chlorinated, and after a few hours they will refill the tank and distribute the treated water to the pipes over 12 hours so that it will disinfect the distribution system. The sources calculate that at 8.00 am this Thu 17 Aug 2017 the disinfection process will be done and the residents of the Calicanto development will have water again. Public health recommended to the City of Chiva and the water management firm, as well as residents, that internal networks be sanitized, for example, in the case of electric and gas heaters, that water tanks be left plugged in and the water be kept at a temperature of at least 60 degrees Celsius 140 \u00b0F. After any absence of more than 10 days, or at least once a year, the water system has to be cleaned and disinfected. To do this, disinfect the faucet tap diffusers and showers, descale them with conventional anti-scale cleaner and immerse them in a bucket with dilute bleach for 30 minutes (simply add a coffee cup filled with commercial bleach to a 5 litre 1.32 gallon bucket of water). It is also advisable to run cold water and hot water through all faucets in the house simultaneously for 5 minutes, and, in the case of faucet diffusers and showers, replace those that are deteriorated. byline: Jordi Vicent  communicated by: ProMED-mail Calicanto de Chiva is a development in the city of Chiva; Chiva had a population of 15 652 residents in 2014 and is 20 minutes west by car of the coastal city of Valencia ( ). Detection of soluble legionella antigen in urine specimens is a rapid method that can provide an early diagnosis of infection due to _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1, the commonest cause of legionnaires' disease in most localities. The assay will not detect organisms other than _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1. Excretion of legionella antigen in urine may vary among patients. Legionella antigenuria can be detected as early as one day after onset of symptoms and persists for days to weeks. Some individuals have been shown to excrete antigen for extended periods of time (up to one year after acute infection (1).

The 4 cases were reported in Helderberg in the Western Cape. The patients include a mother and 2 children and a neighbor. It is not published who died. Professor Lucille Blumberg with the NICD said it was likely the infected children did not receive all their vaccines. Diphtheria is a dangerous respiratory disease that is caused by a potent toxin produced by certain strains of the bacterium _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_. Diphtheria is extremely contagious through coughing or sneezing. Risk factors include crowding, poor hygiene, and lack of immunization. Symptoms usually appear within a week of infection. This infection is characterized by a sore throat, coughing, and fever very similar to many common diseases like strep throat. Additional symptoms may be bloody, watery discharge from the nose and rapid breathing. However, a presumptive diagnosis can be made by observing a characteristic thick grayish patch (membrane) found in the throat. In more severe cases, neck swelling, and airway obstruction may be observed. In the tropics, cutaneous and wound diphtheria is much more common and can be a source of transmission. The real serious danger is when the toxin that is produced by the bacterium gets into the bloodstream and spreads to organs like the heart and nervous system. Myocarditis, congestive heart failure, and neurological illnesses of paralysis that mimic Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome are most severe. Even with treatment, fatalities are still seen in up to 10 percent of cases. Diphtheria can be treated and cured successfully with antitoxin and antimicrobials if started early enough. The prevention of diphtheria is through vaccination. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ The following is extracted from  : \"Diphtheria takes its name from the Greek word dipthera meaning leather and was named in 1826 by French physician Pierre Bretonneau. This is because it refers to the leathery, sheath-like membrane that grows on the tonsils, throat, and in the nose. It was previously considered to be one of the most dreaded diseases, with frequent large-scale outbreaks in the New England colonies between 1735 and 1740. It was said that the disease killed as many as 80 per cent of the children below 10 years of age. Diphtheria is otherwise called the \"Strangling Angel of Children\" and was a dreaded common childhood illness. Statistics show that in the 1920s, there were an estimated 100 000 to 200 000 cases of diphtheria per year in the USA, with 13 000 to 15 000 deaths.\" The following was extracted from  : \"_C. diphtheriae_ is an aerobic Gram-positive bacillus. Toxin production (toxigenicity) occurs only when the bacillus is itself infected (lysogenized) by a specific virus (bacteriophage) carrying the genetic information for the toxin (tox gene). Only toxigenic strains can cause severe disease. Culture of the organism requires selective media containing tellurite. If isolated, the organism must be distinguished in the laboratory from other _Corynebacterium_ species that normally inhabit the nasopharynx and skin (such as diphtheroids). _C. diphtheriae_ has 4 biotypes: gravis, intermedius, mitis and belfanti. The most severe disease is associated with the gravis biotype, but any strain may produce toxin. All isolates of _C. diphtheriae_ should be tested by the laboratory for toxigenicity. \"Susceptible persons may acquire toxigenic diphtheria bacilli in the nasopharynx. The organism produces a toxin that inhibits cellular protein synthesis and is responsible for local tissue destruction and membrane formation. The toxin produced at the site of the membrane is absorbed into the bloodstream and then distributed to the tissues of the body. The toxin is responsible for the major complications of myocarditis and neuritis and can also cause low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia) and protein in the urine (proteinuria). Clinical disease associated with non-toxin-producing strains is generally milder. While rare severe cases have been reported, these may actually have been caused by toxigenic strains that were not detected because of inadequate culture sampling. \"The incubation period of diphtheria is 2-5 days (range, 1-10 days). Disease can involve almost any mucous membrane. For clinical purposes, it is convenient to classify diphtheria into a number of manifestations, depending on the site of disease. The most common sites of diphtheria infection are the pharynx and the tonsils. Infection at these sites is usually associated with substantial systemic absorption of toxin. The onset of pharyngitis is insidious. Early symptoms include malaise, sore throat, anorexia, and low-grade fever. Within 2-3 days, a bluish-white membrane forms and extends, varying in size from covering a small patch on the tonsils to covering most of the soft palate. Often by the time a physician is contacted, the membrane is greyish-green, or black if bleeding has occurred. There is a minimal amount of mucosal erythema surrounding the membrane. The membrane is adherent to the tissue, and forcible attempts to remove it cause bleeding. Extensive membrane formation may result in respiratory obstruction. \"The patient may recover at this point; or if enough toxin is absorbed, develop severe prostration, striking pallor, rapid pulse, stupor, and coma, and may even die within 6 to 10 days. Fever is usually not high, even though the patient may appear quite toxic. Patients with severe disease may develop marked edema of the submandibular areas and the anterior neck along with lymphadenopathy, giving a characteristic \"bull neck\" appearance. \"Most complications of diphtheria, including death, are attributable to effects of the toxin. The severity of the disease and complications are generally related to the extent of local disease. The toxin, when absorbed, affects organs and tissues distant from the site of invasion. The most frequent complications of diphtheria are myocarditis and neuritis. Myocarditis may present as abnormal cardiac rhythms and can occur early in the course of the illness or weeks later, and can lead to heart failure. If myocarditis occurs early, it is often fatal. Neuritis most often affects motor nerves and usually resolves completely. Paralysis of the soft palate is most frequent during the 3rd week of illness. Paralysis of eye muscles, limbs, and diaphragm can occur after the 5th week. Secondary pneumonia and respiratory failure may result from diaphragmatic paralysis. Other complications include otitis media and respiratory insufficiency due to airway obstruction, especially in infants.\" - Mod.LL ", "dates": ["Date: Mon 14 Aug 2017", "today [Mon 14 Aug 2017]", "100 000 to 200 000 cases of diphtheria per year in the USA with 13", "000 to 15 000 deaths", "\"The incubation period of diphtheria is 2-5 days (range 1-10 days)"], "title": "Diphtheria - South Africa: (WC) fatal "}, "529": {"sentences": "WHO | Turkey  Skip to main content  Access  Home Alt+0  Navigation Alt+1  Content Alt+2  Search  Search the  WHO .int site  Submit  Advanced search  Navigation  Home  Health topics  Data  Media centre  Publications  Countries  Programmes  Governance  About WHO  Language  \u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a  \u4e2d\u6587  English  Fran\u00e7ais  \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439  Espa\u00f1ol  Emergencies preparedness, response  Menu  Home  Ebola outbreak in DRC  Alert and response operations  Diseases  Biorisk reduction  Turkey  24 October 2014 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) \u2013 Turkey  8 August 2006 Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever in Turkey  30 January 2006 Avian influenza \u2013 situation in Turkey \u2013 update 7  18 January 2006 Avian influenza \u2013 situation in Turkey \u2013 update 6  16 January 2006 Avian influenza \u2013 situation in Turkey - update 5  12 January 2006 Avian influenza \u2013 situation in Turkey - update 4 Sequencing of human virus  10 January 2006 Avian influenza \u2013 situation in Turkey - update 3  9 January 2006 Avian influenza \u2013 situation in Turkey - update 2  7 January 2006 Avian influenza \u2013 situation in Turkey - update  5 January 2006 Avian influenza \u2013 situation in Turkey  13 October 2005 Avian influenza \u2013 new areas with infection in birds \u2013 update 34  Related links  Ebola virus disease - website  Avian influenza A(H7N9) virus  Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)  Pandemic (H1N1) 2009  Influenza at the Human-Animal Interface (HAI)  Related documents  WHO outbreak communication guide 2008  WHO outbreak communications guidelines  Outbreak communication: best practices for communicating with the public during an outbreak  Communication for behavioural impact (COMBI)  COMBI toolkit for behavioural and social communication in outbreak response  Field workbook for COMBI planning steps in outbreak response  RSS  Feed of disease outbreak news  All WHO RSS feeds  Disease outbreak news  You are here:  Emergencies preparedness, response  Disease Outbreak News (DONs)  Disease outbreaks by country  Turkey  Quick Links  Sitemap  Home  Health topics  Data  Media centre  Publications  Countries  Programmes and projects  Governance  About  WHO  Help and Services  Contacts  FAQs  Employment  Feedback  Privacy  E-mail scams  WHO Regional Offices  WHO African Region  WHO Region of the Americas  WHO South-East Asia Region  WHO European Region  WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region  WHO Western Pacific Region  &#169;  WHO 2017  Back to top  Email Address  Sign up for WHO updates", "dates": [" 24 October 2014 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) \u2013 Turkey", " 8 August 2006 Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever in Turkey", " 30 January 2006 Avian influenza \u2013 situation in Turkey \u2013 update 7", " 18 January 2006 Avian influenza \u2013 situation in Turkey \u2013 update 6", " 16 January 2006 Avian influenza \u2013 situation in Turkey - update 5", " 12 January 2006 Avian influenza \u2013 situation in Turkey - update 4 Sequencing of human virus", " 10 January 2006 Avian influenza \u2013 situation in Turkey - update 3", " 9 January 2006 Avian influenza \u2013 situation in Turkey - update 2", " 7 January 2006 Avian influenza \u2013 situation in Turkey - update", " 5 January 2006 Avian influenza \u2013 situation in Turkey", " 13 October 2005 Avian influenza \u2013 new areas with infection in birds \u2013 update 34", " Pandemic (H1N1) 2009"], "title": ["Turkey"]}, "280": {"sentences": "   24 Jul 2017 From: Mumtaz A Khan Mrs H.A. a 30yrs old female daughter of A.D., who was suspected of being affected of Congo Crimean Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF), has been reported as positive for CCHF by Virology Laboratory of National Institute of Health (NIH), Islamabad.

Mod.TY, edited The Director General of Health Services of the Ministry of Health, Rodolfo Rocabado, reported this Friday 21 Jul 2017 that the 5th case of yellow fever was registered in the country. He referred to the 1st registered case in Cochabamba that now was controlled. \"We have another case in Cochabamba. The total at the national level will be 5 cases. In La Paz department, 4 are reported, one in Cochabamba. Historically, cases have occurred in Cochabamba, Beni and La Paz.\" He recalled that in La Paz department, 4 yellow fever cases have been registered and lamented the death of a 9-year-old girl in Caranavi municipality (north part of La Paz). \"We are taking action in the endemic zone. We have an epidemiological team that is working together with Departmental Health Services (SEDES). We are taking action, reinforcing our vaccination campaigns for unvaccinated people, because the teams are moving in these areas (Caranavi), and we are investigating the presence of the vector mosquitoes,\" he said. Given this situation, Rocabado stated that they are continuing epidemiological surveillance to detect suspected cases and intensify control. \"The alert will continue; surveillance is being strengthened, and this has permitted us to detect cases because we have intensive surveillance,\" he said. This past 14 Feb 2017, the 1st yellow fever case was reported in the La Paz department. This involved a Dane who visited the Caranavi municipality and was diagnosed with this disease. This obligated the Ministry of Health to issue an alert and reinforce land and air border control.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. These 5 yellow fever (YF) cases were doubtless due to spill over of the sylvan (forest) cycle of transmission to unvaccinated humans rather than to _Aedes aegypti_ urban transmission. Sporadic human cases occur in the Amazon Basin, including the Bolivian tropics, as spill-over from this sylvan (forest) transmission cycle. Control of YF virus transmission within the forest cycle is not possible, leaving vaccination of people living in or traveling to endemic areas as the only feasible preventive measure. As implied in the above report, these 5 individuals almost certainly had not been vaccinated, a problem in the sparsely populated, rural areas in the Amazon Basin, where health services are not readily available. On Mon 9 Jan 2017, a Danish tourist who came to Caranavi in the tropical area of La Paz department, Bolivia became infected with the virus see Yellow fever - Americas (19): Bolivia (LP) http://promedmail.org/post/20170211.4832508.

All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.

Travelers considering pregnancy  Talk to your health care provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you&rsquo;re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Wait at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.

As of January 16, 2017, Chinese health authorities have confirmed 460 new human cases of avian influenza A (H7N9) to the World Health Organization since September 2016. Most of these patients reported exposure to live poultry or poultry markets. A few cases of H7N9 have been reported outside of mainland China but most of these infections have occurred among people who had traveled to mainland China before becoming ill. CDC advises people traveling to China to avoid contact with poultry (including poultry markets and farms), birds, and their droppings and to avoid eating undercooked poultry. Infected birds that appear healthy may still be able to transmit this virus to humans. There are no recommendations against travel to China.  What is avian influenza A (H7N9)?  Avian influenza A (H7N9) is a virus found in birds that does not normally infect humans. However, in the spring of 2013, the first human cases of H7N9 virus infection were reported in China. Since then, 924 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with H7N9 virus have been reported, with about one-third of cases resulting in death. Most of these infections have been associated with exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments (such as poultry markets) in China. In rare cases, limited, non-sustained person-to-person spread of H7N9 virus likely occurred, but there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human infection. Early symptoms are similar to those of other respiratory viruses, including seasonal flu and may include fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches and fatigue, loss of appetite, and runny or stuffy nose. However, infection with this virus often causes severe respiratory illness and, in some cases, death (see http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/h7n9-virus.htm ). Risk factors for severe and fatal outcomes include older age and having certain chronic medical conditions.  What can travelers do to protect themselves?  There is no vaccine available to prevent H7N9 virus infection. To protect yourself when visiting China, take the following steps:  Do not touch birds.  Don&rsquo;t touch birds, whether they are alive or dead.  Avoid live bird or poultry markets, including where birds are slaughtered (wet markets).  Avoid places that might be contaminated with bird feces. .  Eat food that is fully cooked.  Eat meat and poultry that is fully cooked (not pink) and served hot.  Eat hard-cooked eggs (not runny).  As a general precaution, don&rsquo;t eat or drink dishes that include blood from any animal.  As a general precaution, don&rsquo;t eat food from street vendors.  Practice hygiene and cleanliness .  Wash your hands often.  If soap and water aren&rsquo;t available, clean your hands with hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.  Don&rsquo;t touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. If you need to touch your face, make sure your hands are clean.  Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.  Try to avoid close contact, such as kissing, hugging, or sharing eating utensils or cups with people who are sick.  If you feel sick after visiting China:  Talk to your doctor or nurse if you feel seriously ill, especially if you have a fever, cough, or shortness of breath.  Tell your health care provider about your travel to China.  For more information about medical care abroad, see Getting Health Care Abroad (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/getting-health-care-abroad)  Avoid contact with other people while you are sick.  Clinician information  Clinicians should consider the possibility of avian influenza A (H7N9) virus infection in people presenting with respiratory illness within 10 days of travel to China, particularly if the patient reports exposure to birds or poultry markets. Although most H7N9 cases have resulted in severe respiratory illness, infection may cause mild illness in some people, including both adults and children. Guidance for clinicians who suspect avian influenza A (H7N9) virus infection in a returned traveler from China is available. Clinicians should initiate infection control precautions (airborne, droplet, and contact), obtain appropriate specimens , and notify their local or state health department promptly. State health departments should notify CDC of suspected cases within 24 hours. Empiric treatment with influenza antiviral medications may be warranted while testing is pending.  Note that influenza diagnostic testing in patients with respiratory illness of unknown etiology may identify human cases of avian influenza A virus infection. Patients with H7N9 virus infection are expected to have a positive test result for influenza A virus via reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR testing), although most assays will not be able to determine the influenza virus subtype. Use of rapid influenza diagnostic tests are not recommended if H7N9 virus infection is suspected.

The observations include that at all the places the paddy fields were found affected with rice blast disease. \"As enquired from farmers, no disease management practice was adopted in the affected fields. Disease incidence ranging from 10 to 30 per cent and intensity of 3.5 to 17.6 per cent was recorded in China varieties,\" a spokesperson added. The probable causes of the outbreak, as per experts, are: cultivation of varieties susceptible to blast, use of own saved seed, no management practice applied. The team has recommended immediate spray of fungicide.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Pyricularia oryzae_ (synonym _Magnaporthe oryzae_). It is one of the most destructive diseases of the crop worldwide, with potential yield losses of more than 50 per cent. Symptoms include lesions on all parts of the shoot, as well as stem rot and panicle blight. When nodes are infected, all plant parts above the infection die and yield losses are severe. When infection occurs at the seedling or tillering stages, plants are often completely killed. Depending on which plant parts are affected, the disease may manifest itself as leaf, collar, node, or neck blast. More than 50 species of grasses and sedges can be affected by related pathogens, but most strains isolated from rice can only infect a limited number of cultivars. The fungus also causes wheat blast (for example, see ProMED-mail posts http://promedmail.org/post/20170306.4883233 and http://promedmail.org/post/20170123.4784298). Although the pathogens are currently classified as the same species, the wheat blast pathogen is a distinct population (referred to as _P. oryzae_ Triticum population) and does not cause disease in rice. Symptom severity and spread of the blast fungus are influenced by climatic conditions. The disease is also favoured by high nitrogen levels (for example from fertilisers) and high humidity. The fungus is spread with infected plant material (including seed), by mechanical means (including insect activity), water and wind. Disease management may include fungicides and cultural practices but relies mainly on resistant varieties. However, the fungus is highly variable and this favours the emergence of new strains with increased virulence. Use of certified clean seed is essential, and farm saved seed, as mentioned above, would pose a high risk of carry-over of the fungus to subsequent crops. Kashmir has been using rice cultivars from China for a long time. The pathogen strains in that area have been shown to be more closely related to Chinese and Japanese variants than to other Indian ones (ProMED-mail post http://promedmail.org/post/20160407.4145967). This would indicate that these strains were imported into Kashmir together with the host and that resistant rice cultivars developed in China or Japan may be a useful resource for developing resistant varieties suitable for Kashmir. oryzae_ culture: Links Information on rice blast: (with pictures),  , and Impact of rice blast (and other fungal crop diseases): Information on wheat blast:  and _P. oryzae_ taxonomy and synonyms: and - Mod.DHA ", "dates": ["Date: Sat 22 Jul 2017 12:13 AM IST", "org/post/20170306", "4883233 and", "org/post/20170123", "4784298)", "org/post/20160407", "4145967)"], "title": "Blast disease, rice - India: (JK) "}, "249": {"sentences": "   Thu 20 Jul 2017 Source: Regina Leader-Post edited The Broken Hills prairie dog colony at Grasslands National Park is being closed off to visitors after a prairie dog recently died from sylvatic plague. The park is located just outside of Val Marie in southwest Saskatchewan. Two dead ground squirrels were also discovered and have been sent for testing. Sylvatic plague is a rare, but naturally occurring disease that affects wildlife in the region. Sylvatic plague is in the same bacterium that causes bubonic and pneumonic plague in humans _Yersinia pestis_, but it poses very low risk to human health. It is extremely rare for humans to contract the disease. The last confirmed case of human infection in Canada was in 1939 and was not fatal. \"The safety of visitors and staff is Parks Canada's top priority. Grasslands National Park is collaborating with the appropriate provincial and federal government agencies to address this situation and ensure public safety,\" said a press release issued by Parks Canada. Parks Canada staff are dusting burrows in the Broken Hills colony with the insecticide DeltaDust (deltamethrin) to mitigate the potential spread of the disease. The insecticide kills fleas that could carry the sylvatic plague. Parks Canada says it will be closely monitoring the prairie dog population and conduct further disease surveillance within the park. The park itself will remain open. Other prairie dog colonies in the park are still accessible. Since 2010, all prairie dog colonies in the Grasslands National park have been closed to domestic animals to prevent the possibility of pets carrying infected fleas back to their owners.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Grasslands National Park is in SW Saskatchewan and close to the border with the US:  . Presumably the Broken Hills colony was _Yersinia pestis_ naive and when the infection found its way there, it found a ready home and announced itself with significant prairie dog deaths, though its presence has yet to be confirmed. We look forward to the results of the park surveillance. Normally prairie dog sylvatic plague presents few risks to humans but if you see a dead prairie dog do not pick it up, keep your dog well away from it. As we know from affected states in the US cats can bring the fleas into the house so make sure that your cats have regular flea medicine to prevent any infestation.

Haggis ( ) is a savoury pudding containing sheep's pluck (heart, liver and lungs); minced with onion, oatmeal, suet, spices, and salt, mixed with stock, traditionally encased in the animal's stomach though now often in an artificial casing instead. According to the 2001 English edition of the Larousse Gastronomique: \"Although its description is not immediately appealing, haggis has an excellent nutty texture and delicious savoury flavour\". It is believed that food similar to haggis (though not so named), perishable offal quickly cooked inside an animal's stomach, all conveniently available after a hunt, was eaten from ancient times. Although the name \"hagws\" or \"hagese\" was first used in England c. 1430, the dish came to be considered traditionally Scottish, even the national dish, as a result of Scots poet Robert Burns' poem Address to a Haggis of 1787. Haggis is traditionally served with \"neeps and tatties\", boiled and mashed separately, and a dram (a glass of Scotch whisky), especially as the main course of a Burns supper.

WHO/T. Jasarevic  From mid-March 2014, 111 people have tested positive in the Jeddah area; the biggest single surge in the MERS-CoV outbreak since the new virus was detected in April 2012. Thirty-one persons have died.  As a large proportion of infections in Jeddah occurred in health-care facilities, the WHO team began with analyzing transmission patterns in the city\u2019s main hospitals.  \u201cWe need to understand how people got infected in health-care settings, and in the community; we are looking into possible infection routes and whether the virus has changed its ability to more easily infect people,\u201d says Dr Jaouad Mahjour, WHO Team Leader, \u201cbut we know that the systematic application of basic infection prevention and control measures in health facilities is key to limiting transmission and protecting health-care workers and other patients.\u201d  Following the confirmation of the first cases, health facilities increased laboratory testing of patients, close contacts and health-care workers and strengthened protective measures. One third of the people tested positive in the recent spate of cases are health-care workers with mild or no symptoms.  \u201c...but we know that the systematic application of WHO-recommended infection control measures In health facilities is key to limiting the transmission and protecting health-care workers and other patients.\u201d  Dr Jaouad Mahjour  \u201cOur priority is to stop the transmission inside the hospital by strengthening infection prevention and control activities,\u201d says Dr Mohammed Al Ghamdi, an Infectious Disease Consultant at the King Fahd Hospital, the city\u2019s main general hospital - where 78 people have tested positive so far. \u201cWHO is helping us in getting answers on transmission routes not only in health facilities, but also in the community.\u201d  Primary source of infection  Camels are increasingly being seen as the primary source of the MERS-CoV infecting humans, as recent studies showed that camels can harbour live virus. However, it is still unclear how exactly the virus is being transmitted to humans. Once infected, the person can pass the virus to other people, but no sustained chains of infection have been observed.  \u201cUntil we better understand how the virus transmits from camels or the environment to a human, we are likely to see more cases, and with travel, the virus is exportable,\u201d said Dr. Mahjour. \u201cTherefore, understanding this link is key to limiting the outbreak. There is an urgent need to conduct an in-depth epidemiological study of known cases to get this knowledge.\u201d  Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.  Until further information is gathered, it is prudent for persons at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV (including those with diabetes, chronic lung disease, pre-existing renal failure, or those who are immunocompromised) to take appropriate precautions when visiting farm and market environments where camels are present. These measures might include avoiding contact with camels, good hand hygiene, and avoiding drinking raw milk or eating food that may be contaminated with animal secretions or products unless they are properly washed, peeled, or cooked.  For the general public, when visiting a farm, live animal markets or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.  WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

WHO in a statement on Sat 29 Jul 2017 said 419 804 suspected cases of cholera have been reported since 27 Apr 2017, reports Xinhua news agency. The highest number of fatalities were reported from the province of Hajjah and the Red Sea port city of Hodeida, according to WHO. The epidemic has been \"increasing at an average of 5000 a day\", the statement said. The International Committee of the Red Cross has expected the suspected cases of cholera in Yemen to reach 600 000 by the end of 2017. Jamie McGoldrick, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Yemen, said the cholera outbreak is \"entirely man-made and is as a result of the conflict\". More than 2 years into war, Yemen is facing a total collapse, where 2/3 of the total population, around 19 million, need humanitarian aid. About 10.3 million people are at risk of famine and 14.5 million lack access to safe drinking water.  communicated by: ProMED-mail If the epidemic were to continue at the current rate of cases per day, by the end of 2017, there could be 700 000 more cases for a total of 1.12 million cases since the end of April 2017 with 3300 more deaths for a total of about 5500 deaths over that time period.

A total of 10 more people infected with the outbreak strains of _S._ Heidelberg have been reported since 20 Mar 2017, when CDC closed the outbreak investigation. Whole genome sequencing on clinical samples from ill people showed a close genetic relationship between the bacteria that sickened people after 20 Mar 2017, and the bacteria that sickened people before that time. This means that people in both groups were more likely to share a common source of infection and that this outbreak is ongoing. A total of 46 people infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella_ Heidelberg have been reported from 14 states. States / Ill People California / 1 Iowa / 2 Idaho / 1 Indiana / 2 Kentucky / 3 Minnesota / 5 Missouri / 7 North Dakota / 1 New Jersey / 1 Ohio / 1 Oklahoma / 1 South Dakota / 5 Texas / 1 Wisconsin / 15 As many as 14 (30 per cent) people have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. Illnesses started on dates ranging from 27 Jan 2015 to 11 Jul 2017. 15 (33 per cent) people in this outbreak are children under the age of 5. Epidemiologic and laboratory investigations linked ill people in this outbreak to contact with calves, including dairy bull calves. Dairy bull calves are young, male cattle that may be raised for meat. In interviews, ill people answered questions about contact with animals and foods eaten in the week before becoming ill. Of the 44 people interviewed, 29 (66 per cent) reported contact with dairy bull calves or other cattle. Some of the ill people interviewed reported that they became sick after their dairy bull calves became sick or died. Ongoing surveillance in veterinary diagnostic laboratories showed that calves in several states continued to get sick with the outbreak strain of multidrug resistant _S._ Heidelberg after reports of illnesses in people had stopped. \u200eInformation collected earlier in the outbreak indicated that most of the calves came from Wisconsin. Regulatory officials in several states are now tracing the origin of the calves that are linked to the newer illnesses. Antibacterial-resistance testing conducted by CDC on clinical isolates from ill people shows that the isolates were resistant to multiple types of antimicrobials. Antimicrobial resistance may be associated with increased risk of hospitalization, development of a bloodstream infection, or treatment failure in patients. Whole genome sequencing has identified multiple antimicrobial resistance genes in outbreak-associated isolates from 33 ill people, 65 cattle, and 11 from animal environments. This correlates with results from standard resistance testing methods used by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory on clinical isolates from 8 ill people in this outbreak. The 8 isolates tested were susceptible to gentamicin, azithromycin, and meropenem. All 8 were resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline, and had reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. A total of 7 isolates were also resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; 5 were also resistant to nalidixic acid; and 3 were also resistant to chloramphenicol. Follow these steps to prevent illness when working with any livestock: - Always wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water right after touching livestock, equipment, or anything in the area where animals live and roam. Use dedicated clothes, shoes, and work gloves when working with livestock. Keep and store these items outside of your home. - It is especially important to follow these steps if there are children under age 5 in your household. Young children are more likely to get a salmonellosis because their immune systems are still developing. - Work with your veterinarian to keep your animals healthy and prevent diseases. This investigation is ongoing and we will provide updates as more information becomes available. Livestock owners should continue to watch for increased sicknesses in dairy calves and consult their veterinarian if needed.  communicated by: ProMED-mail This continued outbreak is, at this point, related to contact with dairy bull calves, but if the infected cattle are used for meat, undercooked beef may also be relevant. It is important to note that in most individuals who have salmonellosis, the enteritis has resolved before the diagnosis is made and no antimicrobial intervention is needed. In invasive salmonellosis, however, multidrug resistant isolates limit the choices for treatment. Among the 3 antimicrobials (azithromycin, gentamicin, and meropenem) to which the outbreak strain of _S._ Heidelberg is susceptible, azithromycin is the only one that can be given orally. None of the 3 is considered 1st line treatment for salmonellosis. - Mod.LL   .

Corr.SB, edited The city of Trois-Rivi\u00e8res is affected by an increase in legionellosis cases. A total of 8 cases have been detected this month July 2017. A rather high number, as the region normally has between 1 to 8 cases a year. Patients affected by the bacterium _Legionella_ are still hospitalized. No deaths related to the infectious disease have occurred. It is a type of pneumonia with cases at different levels of severity. What is worrying is that the source of the bacterium has still not been localized. The authorities are examining several hypotheses. The hospital has not been involved. Legionellosis is not transmitted from person to person. It is caused by the inhalation of micro-contaminated water droplets suspended in the air. The bacteria can be found in showers, water heaters, spas, and cooling towers with water. Legionellosis is normally uncommon in Quebec. In 2012, in the Capitale-Nationale, a legionellosis epidemic killed 13 people. Capitale-Nationale is one of 17 administrative regions of Quebec, Canada; Quebec City, Quebec's capital, is located in this region, having 73.7 percent of the region's population of 700 616 residents ( ).  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Legionellosis comprises several different syndromes caused by _Legionella_ species, most commonly _Legionella pneumophila_, although 19 other _Legionella_ species have been isolated from human infections: The pneumonic form is called legionnaires' disease; the less severe, self-limiting, non-pneumonic form is called Pontiac fever. Extrapulmonary infections, e.g., wound infections, may occur. The 8 cases that have occurred in the past month July 2017 in Trois-Riviere presumably have legionnaires' disease since the news report says they have pneumonia. _Legionella_ species are found in natural and man-made aqueous environments and soil. Several of these _Legionella_ species are intra-cellular parasites of free-living amoebae. Humans acquire these organisms after exposure to natural or man-made aquatic reservoirs, usually by means of inhalation of aerosols, but also by aspiration, or less commonly by inoculation of wounds. The species of _Legionella_ identified in the 8 patients is not specified in the news report. A common source would be suspected if the 8 patients were infected with the same species and their genotypes matched. We are also not told if there are any epidemiological linkages among the 8 patients; this could help identify possible common sources.

A total of 31 patients were colonised with the so-called \"Japanese fungus\" _Candida auris_ at King's College hospital, in Denmark Hill, after it was passed on from a woman patient admitted from the Royal Brompton, the specialist heart and lung hospital in Chelsea in April 2016. Today 15 Aug 2017 it emerged that more than 200 patients in 20 NHS trusts and private hospitals had been affected, with the intensive care units at the 2 London hospitals among the worst affected. The outbreak at King's lasted a year and only ended in April 2017. In 6 cases, the fungus entered the bloodstream, causing an infection. Board papers for the hospital's parent NHS trust in March 2017 stated: \"While the trust is implementing infection prevention and control protocols, it was noted that the spread of the pathogen is affected by low nursing levels.\" _Candida auris_ was 1st detected in the ear of a patient in Japan in 2009 and has been reported sporadically in England since 2013. The rare fungus, or yeast, lives on the skin or inside the body. Some patients carry it without becoming unwell, but it can cause infections if it gets into surgical wounds or when urinary catheters or drips are inserted. Last year 2016, the US warned that the fungus, which has a high mortality rate and is resistant to infection control measures, was spreading in US health facilities. Public Health England, which this week updated its guidance on dealing with an outbreak, said it appeared to be \"highly transmissible\" between patients, but none of this country's cases had proven fatal ( ). Patients who develop an infection are normally isolated, but King's said it had problems identifying it quickly and finding single rooms. Laboratory tests took \"8-9 days.\" Across the NHS, 35 patients known to be carrying the fungus have been transferred between hospitals. A pilot scheme testing all patients admitted to intensive care was launched in 5 hospitals last month July 2017. About a quarter of detections have been clinical infections, including 27 patients who developed bloodstream infections, Public Health England said. It recommends washing patients with chlorohexidine, a disinfectant used before surgery, to treat colonisation. Kings said its critical care units, liver, and cardiac wards were the worst hit. Board papers revealed: \"The 1st case was a patient admitted from the Royal Brompton in April 2016 who was known to be positive on admission and isolated in a side room on the critical care unit and cardiac wards during her hospital stay.\" The Brompton, which is believed to have been the worst affected hospital in the country, was unable to say how many patients were affected.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail Rapporteur George A. Robertson The following was extracted from my moderator comments in ProMED-mail post Candida auris - USA (04): nosocomial, epidemiology, drug resistance Archive Number: http://promedmail.org/post/20170520.5050111: \"Candida auris_ is a globally emerging, nosocomial, multidrug resistant pathogen associated with a high mortality. Epidemiologic investigations in the U.S. reported above revealed most cases in each state had exposure to common healthcare facilities or had recently received healthcare in other countries and testing in these facilities identified widespread environmental _C. auris_ contamination (mattresses, beds, windowsills, chairs, infusion pumps, and countertops) of patients' rooms. \"Genotyping of isolates by whole genome sequencing indicated that isolates were highly related to one another within each state and grouped with isolates from overseas locations: New York isolates grouped in the same clade as isolates from South Asia; New Jersey isolates also grouped with isolates from South Asia, but were distinct from those in New York; and Illinois isolates grouped with isolates from South America. These data suggest multiple introductions of _C. auris_ into the United States followed by local transmission within healthcare settings. \"Antifungal susceptibility testing at CDC isolates were commonly resistant to fluconazole and many were also resistant to amphotericin B, but isolates were uncommonly resistant to echinocandins (caspofungin, anidulafungin, and micafungin) (3%).\" The U.S. CDC recommends that all _Candida_ isolates obtained from a normally sterile site (e.g., bloodstream) and from non-sterile sites, for example, when a patient is failing therapy for suspected _Candida_ infection at that site or during suspected _Candida_ outbreaks or epidemiological investigations, be identified to the species level. The Public Health England (PHE) has similar recommendations ( ). However, commercially available biochemical-based tests used in many U.S. laboratories to identify fungi cannot differentiate _C. auris_ from related species, and _C. auris_ may be misidentified as _Candida haemulonii_ or reported as _Candida_ species. Some matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) devices and molecular methods based on sequencing the D1-D2 region of the 28s rDNA or the Internal Transcribed Region (ITS) of rDNA, which may only be available at reference laboratories, can identify _C. auris_. The CDC and PHE encourages forwarding suspected _C. auris_ specimens to reference laboratories (CDC or state or regional public health laboratories in the U.S. or PHE Mycology Reference Laboratory in the UK) for further characterization. All confirmed isolates of _C. auris_ in the U.S. should be reported to local and state public health officials and to CDC at ( ). - Mod.ML   .

Zika virus (or Zika) has been reported in Saint Lucia. Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in Saint Lucia are infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:  Women who are pregnant:  Do not travel to Saint Lucia.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to Saint Lucia or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers considering pregnancy:  Before you or your partner travel, talk to your health care provider about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection.  Wait before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.  If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex &ndash; or do not have sex &ndash; for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex, or do not have sex, for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy  Talk to your health care provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you&rsquo;re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Wait at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  Men are advised to wait longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.gov  Contact CDC  Centers for Disease Control and

Albuquerque Journal edited Socorro County is now in the list of New Mexico counties with mosquitoes capable of transmitting Zika virus. Researchers have found _Aedes aegypti_  one of 2 mosquito species capable of transmitting the viral illness  in the City of Socorro, the New Mexico Department of Health DOH said today Tue 22 Aug 2017. Socorro marks the northern-most location of _Aedes aegypti_ yet found in the state. No human cases of Zika virus have been identified in Socorro County to date. There have been no confirmed cases of Zika virus in New Mexico residents this year 2017. In 2016, 10 cases of Zika virus disease were reported in New Mexico, but none was infected locally. In each case, travelers were infected abroad and diagnosed after they returned home. The work began in 2016 when the viral illness was linked to severe birth defects in Brazil and other nations in the Americas. These species of mosquitoes become infected when they take blood from a person already infected with the virus. Once infected, the mosquitoes can bite and infect other people. _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes have been trapped and identified in Do\u00f1a Ana, Eddy, Chaves, Sierra, Lea, Otero, Hidalgo, and Socorro counties. _Aedes albopictus_ has been found in Roosevelt County. byline: Olivier Uyttebrouck  communicated by: ProMED-mail Although _ Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes have been found in southern New Mexico counties in earlier years, this is the 1st report that ProMED-mail has posted of detection of _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes in Socorro county. Finding _Ae. aegypti_ in this county is not surprising. Both _Ae. aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ have been found in various locations in New Mexico. Both have been detected in southern New Mexico but the above report does not indicate if populations of the potential vectors are established and abundant enough to permit ongoing transmission. Thus far, no locally acquired cases of Zika virus infection in New Mexico have been documented. _Ae. aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ have been found in new geographic areas in the USA. Air conditioning and screened windows and doors will help limit their abundance. However, the introduction of viruses such as Zika, chikungunya or dengue into New Mexico will continue, so aggressive vector surveillance and control will be important to limit populations of these vectors. - Mod.TY   .

Based on knowledge about past pandemics, the H1N1 (2009) virus is expected to continue to circulate as a seasonal virus for some years to come. While the level of concern is now greatly diminished, vigilance on the part of national health authorities remains important. Such vigilance is especially critical in the immediate post-pandemic period, when the behaviour of the H1N1 (2009) virus as a seasonal virus cannot be reliably predicted.  For example, it is likely that the virus will continue to disproportionately affect a younger age group, at least in the immediate post-pandemic period. Groups identified during the pandemic as at higher risk of severe or fatal illness will probably remain at heightened risk, though the number of such cases could diminish. In addition, a small proportion of people infected during the pandemic developed a severe form of primary viral pneumonia that is not commonly seen during seasonal epidemics and is especially difficult to treat. It is not known whether this pattern will continue during the post-pandemic period, further emphasizing the need for vigilance.  WHO is today issuing guidance on recommended activities during the post-pandemic period, including advice on epidemiological and virological monitoring, vaccination, and the clinical management of cases.  National health authorities are reminded that cases and local outbreaks of H1N1 (2009) infection will continue to occur, and in some locations, such outbreaks could have a substantial impact on communities.  WHO recommendations to health authorities during the post-pandemic period  Monitoring of respiratory disease activity  WHO recommends that surveillance during the post-pandemic period include:  monitoring for unusual events, such as clusters of severe respiratory illness or death;  investigating severe or unusual cases, clusters or outbreaks to facilitate rapid identification of important changes in the epidemiology or severity of influenza;  maintaining routine surveillance, including for influenza-like illness and cases of severe acute respiratory infections;  continuing to use routine channels of data transmission, such as FluID, FluNet, and EUROFlu, to transmit data from the routine surveillance of respiratory disease;  notifying WHO (including, where appropriate, notifications under the International Health Regulations) immediately if any of the following changes are detected:  sustained transmission of antiviral-resistant H1N1 2009 influenza  human cases of infection with any influenza virus not currently circulating in human populations  any notable changes in the severity or other epidemiological or clinical characteristics of the H1N1 2009 virus, including changes in the age distribution, the clinical appearance, proportion of cases requiring intensive management, or unexpected increases in numbers of cases.  monitoring the H1N1 2009 virus for important genetic, antigenic or functional changes, such as antiviral drug sensitivity.  Vaccination  Vaccination remains important as a means of reducing the morbidity and mortality caused by influenza viruses. WHO strongly recommends vaccination of high-risk individuals in countries where influenza vaccines are available.  The H1N1 influenza virus, which caused the 2009 pandemic, continues to circulate in some parts of the world, causing variable levels of disease and outbreaks. In some countries, seasonal 1 trivalent vaccines are available that cover the H1N1 (2009) virus. In other countries, however, seasonal influenza vaccines are not available. WHO advises that there is still public health value in using monovalent H1N1 vaccine (where available) to immunize persons at risk of severe disease from H1N1 influenza infection, especially where trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine is not available.  Such monovalent H1N1 influenza vaccines should be used according to guidelines of National Regulatory Authorities. WHO will continue to seek advice from the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) as the situation evolves.  Clinical management  Persons suspected of illness from influenza should receive appropriate clinical care. WHO\u2019s guidelines for clinical management, which refer to both seasonal and pandemic influenza, offer guidance. The H1N1 (2009) virus is expected to continue to circulate as a seasonal virus for some years to come. Cases of severe illness in higher-risk individuals, as well as in otherwise healthy individuals, are likely to occur. Early recognition and appropriate treatment of such cases remains important. WHO\u2019s guidelines for use of antiviral medicines, which refer to both seasonal and pandemic influenza, should continue to be followed.  Groups at increased risk of severe illness from the pandemic H1N1 virus included young children, pregnant women, and people with underlying respiratory or other chronic conditions, including asthma and diabetes. Patients who have severe or deteriorating influenza should be treated as soon as possible with oseltamivir. Patients who are at higher risk of severe or complicated influenza should be treated with oseltamivir or zanamivir as soon as possible.

Introduction  As of May 2014, more than 635 cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been reported to WHO.  The virus appears to be circulating widely throughout the Arabian Peninsula and most MERS cases have been reported by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. While most cases have occurred among residents, some cases have occurred among visitors. Based on currently available information, the overall risk for visitors to acquire MERS infection appears to be low.  The currently known epidemiological patterns indicate some infections occur in communities. Cases detected in the community may arise from contact with infected animals or unprocessed products from infected animals, from person-to-person spread in the community, or from acquisition in the healthcare setting by individuals who remained living in the community. Studies are underway to determine the relative contribution of all of these, but the studies are not yet complete. Other infections have occurred in hospitals, primarily when hospitalization of an infected patient, coupled with suboptimal infection control and prevention practices, has led to hospital transmission and outbreaks. Finally, infection among families has been seen and may reflect either person to person transmission or possibly exposure to a common source. At this time, the understanding of how MERS is transmitted is not complete, and we await the results of the studies in progress. There is no information at this time to suggest that widespread transmission is occurring in communities.  Since April 2014, there was an increased number of cases, notably in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and in the United Arab Emirates in both communities and health care setting. The latest information on MERS-CoV can be found here:  http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/en/  II. Effective communication of risk information  It is important for countries to use all practical and effective means possible to communicate information on a range of issues before, during and after Umra and Hajj to all key groups, including the following:  travellers to Umra and Hajj, particularly vulnerable groups within this population;  public health officials;  health care staff responsible for the care of ill pilgrims;  transportation and tourism industries; and  the general public.  2.1. Actions for countries to take in preparation for Umra and Hajj  Countries should advise travellers that persons with pre-existing major medical conditions (e.g. chronic diseases such as diabetes, chronic lung disease, immunodeficiency) are more likely to develop severe infection for MERS if they are exposed to the virus. Pilgrims should be advised to consult a health care provider before travelling to review the risk and assess whether making the pilgrimage is advisable.  Countries should advise travellers and travel organizations on general travel health precautions 1 , which will lower the risk of infection in general, including influenza and traveller\u2019s diarrhoea. Specific emphasis should be placed on:  hand hygiene 2 and respiratory hygiene (covering mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, washing hands after contact with respiratory secretions, and keeping a distance of one metre with other persons when having acute febrile respiratory symptoms);  adhering to good food-safety practices, such as avoiding undercooked meat or food prepared under unsanitary conditions, and properly washing fruits and vegetables before eating them;  maintaining good personal hygiene;  Countries should make health related advice available to all travellers departing for Umra or Hajj by working with the travel and tourism sectors and placing such materials at strategic locations (eg. travel agent offices or points of departure in airports). Different kinds of communication, such as health alerts on board of planes and ships, and banners, pamphlets and radio announcements at international points of entry, can also be used to reach travellers. Travel advice should include current information on MERS-CoV and guidance on how to avoid illness while travelling.  Countries should distribute current WHO guidelines, or their national equivalents, on surveillance 3 , infection prevention and control measures 4 and clinical management 5 of MERS-CoV to health care practitioners and health care facilities.  Countries should ensure that they have access to adequate laboratory services for testing for MERS-CoV and that information on how to obtain laboratory services and clinical referral is known to health care providers and facilities.  Countries should advise travellers to delay their travel if they develop a significant acute respiratory illness with fever and cough.  Countries should provide medical staff accompanying pilgrims with up to date information and guidance on MERS-CoV, ensuring that:  they are alert to the early signs of a developing respiratory infection and pneumonia:  they know who is considered to be in a high-risk group;  they know what to do when a suspected case is identified;  they are aware of simple health measures to reduce transmission.  2.2. Actions to take during Umra or Hajj  Countries should advise travellers that if they develop a significant acute respiratory illness with fever and cough (severe enough to interfere with usual daily activities) during Umra or Hajj,they should:  report to the medical staff accompanying the group or to the local health services;  cover their mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, wash hands afterwards, or if this is not possible, cough or sneeze into upper sleeves of their clothing;  avoid attending crowded places and preferably isolate themselves until the end of the respiratory symptoms and, if isolation is not possible, use a tissue for covering nose and mouth or a surgical mask when in crowded places 6 .  Countries should advise travellers to avoid close contact with camels, visit farms and consume unpasteurized camel milk, urine or improperly cooked meat.  2.3. Actions to take after Umra or Hajj  Countries should advise returning travellers that if they develop a significant acute respiratory illness with fever and cough (severe enough to interfere with usual daily activities) during the two weeks after their return, they should:  seek medical attention, informing health attendants of their recent travel for Umra or Hajj;  immediately notify their local health authority;  take precautions when coughing or sneezing (see 2.2. above);  minimize their contact with others to keep from infecting them.  Countries should alert health practitioners and facilities to test returning travellers with a clinical presentation that suggests the diagnosis of MERS-CoV to be tested for MERS-CoV and to implement infection prevention and control measures. Confirmed cases of MERS-CoV must be reported to WHO. Clinicians should also be alerted to the possibility of atypical presentations in patients who are immunocompromised.  III. Measures at borders and for conveyances  WHO does not recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions or entry screening.  WHO encourages countries to provide information on MERS and this travel advice to transport operators and ground staff, and about self-reporting of illness by travellers.  As provided by the IHR, countries should ensure that;  routine measures are in place at point of entry for assessing ill travellers detected on board conveyances (such as planes and ships) and at entry;  procedures and means are in place for communicating information on ill travellers between conveyance and points of entry as well as between points of entry and national health authorities;  safe transportation of symptomatic travellers to hospitals or designated facilities for clinical assessment and treatment is organized.  If a sick traveller is on board a plane, a passenger locator form 7 can be used. This form is useful for collecting contact information for passengers, which can be used for follow-up if necessary.  1 International Travel and Health http://www.who.int/ith/en/index.html .  2 World Health Organization., WHO Patient Safety.

Oropouche has adapted to urban environments and is moving ever closer to Brazil's major cities. An arbovirus transmitted by a mosquito (like Zika and yellow fever), Oropouche causes acute fever and may lead to meningitis and meningoencephalitis (inflammation of the brain and meninges). \"Oropouche is a virus that could potentially emerge at any moment and cause a serious public health problem in Brazil,\" said Luiz Tadeu Moraes Figueiredo, a professor at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo's Ribeir\u00e3o Preto Medical School (FMRP-USP). Figueiredo is a researcher for a Thematic Project supported by the S\u00e3o Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) focusing on emerging zoonotic viroses. According to him, about 500 000 cases of Oropouche fever have been reported in Brazil in recent decades but that the number of cases will grow because the virus, transmitted by the midge _Culicoides paraensis_, is no longer found only in Amazonian villages and is spreading to the big cities. \"_C. paraensis_ is distributed throughout the Americas, and Oropouche virus therefore has considerable emergence potential,\" he said. \"The virus may well spread from the Amazon region and central plateau to the most densely populated regions of the country.\" The incidence of Oropouche fever is also rising in urban areas of Peru and Caribbean countries. In Brazil, the virus has been isolated from birds in Rio Grande do Sul state and from a marmoset in Minas Gerais state. The presence of neutralizing antibodies (which bind to the virus, tell the immune system to destroy it, and prevent it from infecting the organism) has been detected in primates in the city of Goi\u00e2nia Goi\u00e1s state. \"We recently diagnosed a patient from Ilh\u00e9us city in the northeastern state of Bahia with Oropouche fever, in partnership with Eurico Arruda a professor in FMRP-USP's Department of Cellular Biology. This shows the virus is circulating around Brazil,\" Figueiredo said. In 2002, researchers at FMRP-USP diagnosed 128 people infected by Oropouche virus in Manaus, Amazonas state's capital city. They presented with typical symptoms of the infection, such as acute fever, joint pain, headache, and pain behind the eyes; 3 also developed a central nervous system infection. \"The virus was found in these patients' cerebrospinal fluid,\" Figueiredo said. The researchers were intrigued to find that one of these 3 patients had neurocysticercosis, an infection of the central nervous system caused by the pork tapeworm _Taenia solium_, and another had AIDS. \"This shows that some immunodepressive diseases can facilitate penetration of the central nervous system by the virus. Hardly anyone thinks of this when treating an arbovirus infection, but the possibility must be considered,\" Figueiredo said. The 128 patients with Oropouche in Manaus had been clinically diagnosed with dengue fever. The Oropouche and dengue viruses produce similar symptoms. For this reason, researchers at FMRP-USP and other institutions such as Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Oswaldo Cruz Fiocruz have begun to warn that many suspected cases of dengue in Brazil may be cases of infection by Oropouche. The report above indicates that it is spreading, as the biting midge vector, _Culicoides paraensis_, becomes more urbanized in its distribution. The results of blood samples taken in 20 municipalities in Amazonas state indicate the presence of the virus of Oropouche fever. This has been confirmed by Fiocruz Amazonia in an investigation carried out together with state health surveillance. The sampling corresponds to the 2011-2016 period. In total, 306 individuals were investigated, and 9 positives were found among them (see Oropouche virus - Brazil http://promedmail.org/post/20170814.5247798). Surveillance will need to be intensified, with corresponding laboratory support, to be able to differentiate Oropouche virus infection from infections caused by dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. Oropouche virus is a bunyavirus of the Simbu group. No vaccine is available, so avoidance of bites by the vector midge is the best preventive measure. - Mod.TY ", "dates": ["Date: Tue 22 Aug 2017", "According to him about 500 000 cases of Oropouche fever have been", "In 2002 researchers at FMRP-USP diagnosed 128 people infected by", "the 2011-2016 period", "org/post/20170814", "5247798)"], "title": "Oropouche virus - Brazil (02) "}, "700": {"sentences": "WHO | 2000 - Measles in Ireland  Skip to main content  Access  Home Alt+0  Navigation Alt+1  Content Alt+2  Search  Search the  WHO .int site  Submit  Advanced search  Navigation  Home  Health topics  Data  Media centre  Publications  Countries  Programmes  Governance  About WHO  Language  \u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a  \u4e2d\u6587  English  Fran\u00e7ais  \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439  Espa\u00f1ol  Emergencies preparedness, response  Menu  Home  Ebola outbreak in DRC  Alert and response operations  Diseases  Biorisk reduction  2000 - Measles in Ireland  09 August 2000 Disease Outbreak Reported  As of 29 July 2000, the National Disease Surveillance Centre, Ireland has reported 1 376 cases of measles, including 2 deaths since 1 January 2000.

He explained that the departments of both epidemiology and sanitary regulation are responsible for dealing with this type of cases: \"It is the responsibility of sanitary regulation to carry out the sampling of products, especially goats' cheese and thus verify that they are free of this disease, and the department of epidemiology performs the sampling for confirmatory tests at the state level, which is why there are 19 cases already confirmed.\" He also pointed out that once these cases are confirmed, medical treatment is started, which consists of streptomycin and tetracycline administered for 21 days. \"This disease, like many others, is serious if left untreated. After 21 days we wait a month before we do another sampling and send it back to the state laboratory to confirm that the patients are free of the disease; if not treatment continues until the person is healthy,\" he said.

It was not until 1887 that a British physician, Dr David Bruce, isolated the organism that causes brucellosis from several deceased patients from the island of Malta. This disease has had several names throughout its history, including Mediterranean fever, Malta fever, Crimean fever, Bang's disease, and undulant fever (because of the relapsing nature of the fever associated with the disease). See  . The symptoms and signs of brucellosis may develop from days to months after the initial exposure to the organism. While some individuals may develop mild symptoms, others may go on to develop long-term chronic symptoms. The signs and symptoms of brucellosis are extensive, and they can be similar to many other febrile illnesses, so recognition of potential exposure from ingestion of unpasteurized milk or cheese, working in a slaughter house or meat processing plant, or working in a microbiology lab is critical information when evaluating a case.

The 4-year-old boy, currently being treated at a private hospital, has tested positive for scrub typhus. The boy started suffering from high fever on 21 Jul 2017 and he was admitted to a private hospital at Sagolband in Imphal for treatment. The serological test confirmed as scrub typhus case. The child is a resident of Pukhao village in Imphal but staying at his aunt's residence at Thangmeiband in Imphal. It is believed the kid contracted the infection when he was playing at Cheiraoching in Thangmeiband about 10 days back. Following the confirmation of the child suffering from the disease, a team of medical officers of state health services rushed to the hospital and observed the condition of the child. According to the doctors attending him, the condition of the child was improving slowly and his life is out of risk. The disease can be cured if treated timely. There is no need for panic by the people. The disease is curable though it is dangerous if treatment is delayed, the doctors opined. Scrub typhus, an acute fever-causing infectious illness caused by a bacterium called _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, has claimed the life of a youth who was staying at a flood camp at Sekmaijing Mamang Leikai in Imphal West district.

The boy, 5, and his sister, 3, of Wright County, were sickened by an infection called Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) or enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ EHEC on Sun 9 Jul 2017, Fox 9 reported. The siblings battled symptoms including non-stop bloody stool and vomiting, eventually leading them into acute kidney failure. Last week week of 9-15 Jul 2017, the young girl, who would have turned 4-years-old next month August 2017, died when the Shiga toxin from the bacteria attacked the toddler's kidneys and neurological system. \"Her brain and heart were being damaged,\" her parents wrote on their donation site, CaringBridge. \"Our sweet sweet little girl lost the battle. \"We got to hold her free of tubes and snuggle and kiss her. She is the most amazing little girl in the world. Our hearts are aching with the deepest sadness,\" they wrote in the post. The parents said their son \"is still fighting\" despite the toxins reaching his neurological system. \"He has had a blood transfusion and is on kidney dialysis and may need platelets,\" the post read. \"He has a long road to recovery and we hope and pray the toxins stay away from his brain and heart and other organ systems.\" It's unclear how the Minnesota siblings contracted the strain of _E. coli_ that led to hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a complication caused by the bacterial infection, the Star Tribune reported. The family visited a local petting zoo recently before they became ill, but officials cautioned that the children could have been infected from various sources. The animals at the display were taken away as an \"abundance of precaution.\" State health officials are investigating the source of the bacterium, according to Star Tribune.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. The case fatality rate for EHEC is usually below 10 percent. There is significant evidence that the administration of most antimicrobial agents early in EHEC disease may increase the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Most fatalities are in individuals who develop central nervous system complications in HUS. Since CS Wong and colleagues reported a relative risk of the development of HUS in _E. coli_ O157 infection of 17.3 (95 percent confidence interval 2.2 to 137) (1), it has generally been thought that antimicrobial agents increase HUS risk. In this study, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and beta-lactam drugs were those most linked to HUS. Whether other antimicrobial agents would likewise be linked to HUS, whether the same effect would occur in adults, whether non-O157 strains would behave similarly, and what the mechanism of the effect is are not clearly known. Overall, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (also referred to as cotrimoxazole) and fluoroquinolones seemed to be the prime offenders, both not uncommonly used empirically for perceived bacterial enteritis. As discussed in Kimmitt's paper in Emerging Infectious Diseases, the Shiga toxin genes reside on a lambda-like bacteriophage genome integrated into the bacterial chromosome (2). Different EHEC strains contain various numbers of these phages displaying much diversity and some being defective (3). In particular, fluoroquinolones induce high-level expression of previously silent bacteriophage genes with coexpression of the toxin genes. A number of studies have addressed Shiga toxin production and/or release using a variety of antimicrobial agents at subinhibitory and/or suprainhibitory concentrations using a variety of markers for toxin. These include direct immunologic measurement, cytotoxicity assays, and enzyme reporters. It appears that imipenem (4) and rifaximin (5) do not induce toxin production or phage-mediated cell lysis, suggesting that these agents may not increase the risk of HUS and might be useful in management. TJ Ochoa and colleagues found that fluoroquinolones induced Shiga toxin induction much more commonly in O157 than non-O157 strains (5), but Lee and Stein did not (6). References: 1.

Scrub typhus is caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a rickettsia-like microorganism that is transmitted by chiggers, the larval stage of trombiculid mites, which feed on the skin cells of animals, including humans and rodents. After feeding on their hosts, chiggers drop to the ground and become nymphs, which then mature into adults that feed only on plant materials. The cutaneous reaction to chiggers leaves a characteristic black eschar that is useful for making the diagnosis. Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the infected chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation. Rodents may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_ in nature ( ). - Mod.ML ", "dates": ["Date: Fri 18 Aug 2017", "As of [Tue 15 Aug 2017] (until Aug 18) at least 17 scrub typhus (ST)"], "title": "Scrub typhus - Nepal (08): (KT) more cases "}, "285": {"sentences": "   Sun 23 Jul 2017 12.05 AM IST Source: The Times of India, Times News Network (TNN) edited With the wind season gaining pace in the past week, a viral disease called 'parvo' has begun taking a toll on the dogs in the city Trichy Tamil Nadu. The lack of awareness on the treatment for the disease has put canines at the risk of death. Being an airborne disease, the parvovirus has already infected several dogs in the city. This was evident from the number of dogs that were brought to the veterinary polyclinic in Palakkarai in Trichy. There are 13 such polyclinics across the district and sources said that all clinics were witnessing a rise in such cases since the commencement of wind season. An animal welfare activist claimed that the polyclinic in Palakkarai received 20 to 30 cases of parvo daily in the past week. \"Though viral diseases affect dogs normally, it is virulent during the wind season,\" said honorary animal welfare officer G Ramakrishnan. He pointed out that there was a huge gap between the number of affected dogs and those being brought for treatment. He blamed the public for not identifying the virus and not bringing the affected dogs to veterinary centres for treatment. It was observed that majority of pet lovers were unaware of the symptoms of parvo. Affected dogs will exhibit symptoms such as diarrhea with blood, fever, weight loss, weakness, etc. \"People can easily notice that affected dogs would not take food for 2 days continuously. This is a major symptom. If not treated immediately, the dog may die,\" said Ramakrishnan. People's unawareness would result in the disease spreading to other dogs in the area. Doctors advise 5 to 7 days treatment to save the dogs from the virus. \"Parvo affects pups from when they are 2 months old. Once infected by the disease, the dog will develop immunity to fight the virus. But they should be treated when they are affected for the 1st time,\" said clinician Dr V Varadharan, veterinary polyclinic, Palakkarai. Stating that most dogs infected by parvo are left untreated to die, Ramakrishnan suggested organising camps in all areas by NGOs to identify stray dogs and vaccinate them, to prevent such diseases including rabies. It may be noted that there was no survey on stray dogs in the district.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) is one of the most important enteric pathogens of dogs. This virus is extremely contagious, causing high morbidity with increased incidence in shelters, pet stores, and breeding kennels. The disease is characterized by a rapid clinical course with death that can often occur 2-3 days after onset of signs in non protected hosts. It can affect dogs at any age, but severe infection is most common in puppies between 6 weeks and 6 months of age. All breeds are susceptible to the disease, although the mixed breeds are described to be less susceptible than many purebreds. Rottweilers, Doberman pinschers, English springer spaniels, American pit bull terriers, and German shepherds are the purebreds that have been reported with higher risk for CPV enteritis. Throughout the years, 3 genetically-differentiated variants of CPV-2 have been identified globally: CPV-2a (VP2 426Asn), CPV-2b (VP2 426Asp), and CPV-2c (VP2 426Glu). India is one of the countries in which all 3 variants have been identified in affected canines (see \"Fig. 3. Geographical distribution of 3 CPV variants based on 426 residue detected in domestic dogs worldwide\" on page 2048 of ref 1 below; ). The infection is generally acquired by the faecal-oral route through the contact with faeces from infected dogs or contaminated surfaces. Upon entering the body, the virus affects mainly mitotically active tissues, such as the lymphoid tissues, intestinal epithelium, and bone marrow, as well as the heart in neonatal pups. Following an incubation period of 3-7 days, the disease can be characterized by 2 clinical forms, the enteric form that comprises vomiting, haemorrhagic diarrhoea, depression, loss of appetite, fever and dehydration in younger dogs. Myocarditis may be seen after infection of neonatal puppies, where the clinical signs are seen a number of weeks after infection. Canine parvoviral infection is also characterized by a drop in the white blood cell counts as a result of the infection of the bone marrow infection and other lymphoid tissues. The main method for controlling the disease in domestic animals is by vaccination. After the emergence of the disease, modified live virus vaccines were soon developed, with the 1st CPV vaccine becoming available in 1979. The vaccines appear to be safe and to confer protective immunity allowing much of the disease to be controlled. However, the virus is still widely distributed in nature, and if pups are not vaccinated, and or when maternal antibodies interfere with their vaccination, they generally become naturally infected. The evolution of the virus raises questions about the efficacy of some vaccines, so that an understanding of the variation is required. For the above and additional information on canine parvovirus, subscribers are referred to the review in ref 1. The attribution of the current spread of canine parvovirus in Trichy to the wind season and airborne route of infection, is debatable.<br><br><strong> Reference -</strong><br> 1.

In the 11 day period since the last update, there have been 7 newly confirmed cases reported of whom 5 were from Dawmat Aljandal (Al Jawf region), the location that had nosocomial transmission identified since the beginning of this past month July 2017. Clearly transmission is continuing in this area, with 3 newly confirmed secondary cases in household contacts - at least 2 of whom were identified through screening of asymptomatic household contacts, and 2 additional cases in which high risk exposures are still under investigation. We do not know if these household contacts are associated with the earlier identified transmission chain in Dawmat Aljandal or if these are newly identified chains of transmission. The other 2 newly confirmed cases involve \"sporadic\" cases - an individual in Hail whose high risk exposure history is still under investigation, and an individual from Alaflaj (Riyadh region) with a history of direct contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. As to be expected, concern is being voiced on the international level with the upcoming Hajj and this recent increase in cases reported both in Saudi Arabia and in the UAE. We now have gone through 5 Hajj periods since the identification of the MERS-CoV and to date there have been no cases of MERS-CoV infection identified in returning Hajjis. The case in the UAE (see section 1 above) actually had onset of illness over 1 month ago with no secondary cases/infections identified among known contacts of this case. As for the cases in Saudi Arabia, and more specifically the Hajj, population movement is very well defined during the Hajj, no camels are permitted in the areas where Hajjis are congregated, and there are Hajj specific health services that are separate from those that are available for the general Saudi population, all factors that are reducing the likelihood of Hajjis having inadvertent (or intentional) high risk exposures. Hopefully my optimism is well placed and we will pass through a 6th Hajj period without impact on international transmission of the MERS-CoV associated with this Hajj. - Mod.MPP ", "dates": ["[2] Saudi Arabia 7 new cases - Saudi MOH 19-29 Aug 2017", "Date: Mon 28 Aug 2017", "On [29 Jul 2017] the national IHR focal point of the United Arab", "MERS-CoV case reported on 29 July 2017*", "[28 Aug 2017]", "29 Jul 2017 / United Arab Emirates / Al Ain / 54 / M / No / No / NA /", "NA / No / 11 Jul 2017 / 25 Jul 2017 / Alive", "presented at a hospital in Al Ain on [16 Jul 2017]", " On [16 Jul 2017]", " On [25 Jul 2017] his symptoms worsened and", "On [26 Jul 2017] showing no signs of improvement the patient was", "A 2nd sputum sample was collected on [26 Jul 2017] and both samples", "tested positive for MERS-CoV on [27 Jul 2017]", "Jul 2017 with the date of onset of symptoms 11 Jul 2017 and date of", "positive laboratory testing for MERS-CoV of 25 Jul 2017", "this year with 2 previous cases in May 2017 from Al Ain and 2", "Date: Tue 29 Aug 2017", "Source: Saudi MOH 19-29 Aug 2017 [edited]", "As of [Tue 29 Aug 2017] there have been a total of:", "688 deaths [reported case fatality rate 40", "Since the last ProMED-mail update [Fri 18 Aug 2017] there have been a", "Date: 27 Aug 2017 (1 case)", "Date: 26 Aug 2017 (3 cases)", "Date: 24 Aug 2017 (2 cases)", "Date: 21 Aug 2017 (1 case)", "Date: 27 Aug 2017", "[reported as a newly confirmed case on [15 Aug 2017] noted to be in", "Date: 25 Aug 2017 (1 recovery)", "as a newly confirmed case on [7 Aug 2017] at which time he was noted", "Date: 24 Aug 2017 (1 recovery)", "Date: 21 Aug 2017 (3 recoveries)", "newly confirmed case on [6 Aug 2017] at which time she was noted to be", "newly confirmed case on [8 Aug 2017] at which time she was noted to be", "newly confirmed case on [8 Aug 2017] at which time he was noted to be", "Date: 20 Aug 2017 (1 recovery)", "[reported as a newly confirmed case on [4 Aug 2017] at which time she", "44-year-old expat female on 15 Aug 2017 suggesting either this is a"], "title": "MERS-CoV (56): UAE, Saudi Arabia (JF, HA, RI),\r\n\tWHO "}, "346": {"sentences": "   28 Jul 2017 Source: Wisconsin State Journal edited Two horses died this week after being infected with eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEE or EEEv), a severe, mosquito-borne disease, in the Tomah area, according to the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Lab. The lab, housed at UW-Madison, discovered eastern equine encephalitis virus in the brain tissue of the horses, which were last vaccinated in the fall of 2016. The virus is deadly in horses about 90 percent of the time. The disease can also be transmitted to humans, in rare cases. The virus, which is typically transmitted between birds, can be carried to and between horses and humans via mosquitoes. If a human contracts the virus, there is a 33 percent mortality rate, with a risk of significant brain damage in many survivors, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The spread of the virus is prompted by especially warm and humid weather. Last year 2016, the virus infected 19 horses in 11 Wisconsin counties, according to the Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection. Keith Poulsen, a large animal veterinarian at the lab, recommends that horses be vaccinated in the spring, to prepare for mosquito season.

We demonstrate that despite an efficient vaccination program, HAV can still be transmitted to an unvaccinated high-risk population. An ongoing hepatitis A outbreak involving 15 European countries with the 1st case identified in June 2016 in the United Kingdom (UK) 1, was recently reported 2. By June 2017, 1173 hepatitis A virus (HAV) infections mainly among men who have sex with men (MSM) were notified. In December 2016, when the 1st hepatitis A cases in Tel Aviv district were diagnosed, the local public health authority was notified and an ongoing virological, epidemiological and environmental surveillance has commenced. Here we report the current findings of Tue 1 Jun 2017.<br><br><strong> Identification of hepatitis A virus 1a in clinical and environmental samples </strong><br> Hepatitis A is a notifiable disease in Israel and only 17 sporadic cases were reported between March 2013 and December 2016 in the Tel Aviv district, when the 1st case of the current hepatitis A outbreak was identified in a hospitalized man. A case was defined as a report of an individual who had been in the Tel Aviv health district (covering the Tel Aviv metropolitan region) with a clinical presentation of abrupt onset of hepatitis (fatigue, nausea, anorexia, abnormal liver function tests) and laboratory confirmed anti-HAV (immunoglobulin M, IgM positivity) serology. By June 2017, 19 cases of HAV infection confirmed by serology were notified to the Tel Aviv district health office (Figure 1 for figures and tables, see original URL - Mod.LL). Up to 17 cases were men, aged 22 to 41 years, who self-identified as MSM. One was a woman with a travel history to India during the incubation period. Of the 15 MSM, 3 had traveled to Europe, and one to the USA in the 2 months before symptom onset. A total of 15 infections were also confirmed by RT-PCR and sequencing: 8 MSM were infected by the HAV 1a_ RIVM_HAV16-90 (EUROPRIDE) and 6 by the HAV 1a_ VRD_521_2016 (UK/SPAIN) strain; the woman was infected with an HAV 1b_India strain. The Table shows the characteristics of the patients, none of whom were vaccinated. To support the outbreak investigation, the presence of HAV sequences was assessed in sewage samples (n\u2009=\u200923) collected between August 2016 and June 2017 as part of the routine polio surveillance program 3 from 3 facilities located in the Tel Aviv area. All sewage samples collected between August and the end of December 2016 were HAV- negative. Up to 7 of the 15 samples (3/7 from the Shafdan, the sewage treatment plant of Tel Aviv, and 4/4 samples from a southern Tel Aviv pipeline), collected between January and June 2017, were found to be HAV-positive. Phylogenetic analysis of clinical and sewage HAV-positive samples showed that all sequences from the current outbreak among MSM in Israel and the 7 positive sewage samples, clustered with either RIVM_HAV16-90 (EUROPRIDE) or VRD_521_2016 (UK/SPAIN) isolates identified in the 2016-2017 European HAV outbreak 1,4,5. A total of 3 MSM were infected with the VRD_521_2016 (UK/SPAIN) strain and epidemiologically-linked to the same non-household venue. Moreover, sequencing results were available for 3 of 4 MSM who reported traveling in the 2 months before symptoms onset. One of them, identified with the VRD_521_2016 (UK/SPAIN) strain in December 2016 (week 52), was most likely infected in Berlin. Another adult MSM, harboring the RIVM_HAV16-90 (EUROPRIDE) strain and diagnosed in May 2017 (week 18), reported a stay in Poland during the incubation period. The 3rd MSM, diagnosed in late May 2017 (week 22), presented with acute hepatitis 2 weeks after returning from New York and carried the VRD_521_2016 (UK/SPAIN) strain. All other cases had not traveled abroad and were infected in Israel. HAV isolates from sewage also clustered with both HAV strains implicated in the ongoing European outbreak. In 2 of the sewage samples (9794 and 9773), both strains could be identified together. HAV sequences from past outbreaks in Tel Aviv formed a separate cluster with HAV 1b sequences (Figure 1, 2).<br><br><strong> Laboratory investigation </strong><br> Serum or plasma samples from acute hepatitis A cases positive for anti-HAV IgM were transferred to the national centre of HIV and viral hepatitis in the central virology laboratory of the Ministry of Health. Total nucleic acids were purified from 400 uL of plasma (or from 500 uL of filtered and concentrated sewage samples) and real-time PCR for HAV detection was performed as described previously 6. PCR and sequencing primers of a 460-nt fragment located within the VP1/P2A region were chosen according to the HAVNET unified typing protocol 7. Sequencing was performed on an ABI 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, US) using an ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). Raw sequence data was analysed corrected and trimmed to generate a 427-nt consensus sequence using Sequencher 5.4 (GeneCodes, Ann Arbor, Michigan, US). The resulting HAV sequences were aligned with the 3 distinct HAV 1a strains representing the current HAV MSM outbreak in Europe and with sequences from previously identified HAV infections in Israel. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using a neighbour-joining algorithm in MEGA, version 6 8, with 1000 replicates for bootstrap testing.<br><br><strong> Discussion </strong><br> Hepatitis A virus infection causes a substantial number of viral hepatitis cases worldwide. It is an acute self-limiting illness, associated with fever, malaise, nausea, anorexia and jaundice, mainly transmitted via the fecal-oral route 9. A 2-dose universal toddler's vaccination program at 1.5 and 2 years of age, was initiated in Israel in 1999 and has led to an over \u200990 percent decline in incidence of the disease 10. However, the program cannot prevent HAV infection in high risk groups like MSM born in Israel before 1999. Between March 2012 and March 2013, there was an outbreak in the Tel Aviv district with 75 cases of acute hepatitis, of which 73 percent were in non-vaccinated young men. HAV 1b was the predominant subtype identified in clinical as well as in sewage samples collected during the outbreak 6. In the ongoing HAV outbreak occurring in the Tel Aviv district, in non-vaccinated, MSM in the age-group of 20-45 years, 2 of the 3 strains currently circulating in MSM in Europe were identified. They were detected in clinical samples from patients and in samples collected from sewage facilities located in the Tel Aviv area. Interestingly, none of the sewage samples collected in the 5 months before the first HAV case was identified, were HAV-positive. We therefore assume that these strains did not circulate in Tel Aviv before December 2016. Moreover, a different HAV subtype, HAV 1b, dominated in the 2012-13 outbreak that affected mainly non-vaccinated injecting drug users and not MSM. The identification of individuals that reported being infected while abroad also supports the conclusion that the current outbreak was imported to Israel by traveling MSM. Anti-HAV vaccine is routinely recommended by the Israeli Ministry of Health to various risk groups, including MSM 11. Following the identification of the 1st hepatitis A cases in MSM in Tel Aviv, we communicated about the outbreak through social media and offered free of charge vaccinations at all public health offices and sex clinics in Israel. Leaflets explaining HAV transmission and calling for anti-HAV vaccination were distributed at the venue where 3 infections occurred. Controlling the outbreak and protecting those who are not immune is complicated by undernotification as well as by possible asymptomatic HAV infection leading to continuous virus circulation. The abundance of HAV isolates in the environmental samples indicates that not all HAV cases have been identified. In the past, molecular and phylogenetic analysis of HAV-positive cases in Israel was only done in specific cases. Following the 2012-13 outbreak, the need for a national diagnostic laboratory to support public health decisions on hepatitis A was emphasized. In June 2017, the viral hepatitis reference laboratory in the central virology laboratory of the Ministry of Health was formally established and an official requirement to send IgM-positive HAV samples for molecular confirmation put in place. Thus future outbreaks are expected to be better assessed. Our findings in the MSM population together with the current reports from Europe and recently also in North America 12 call for introduction of new methodologies aiming to increase vaccination coverage specifically within this risk group.<br><br><strong> References </strong><br> 1.

J Clin Virol. 2012; 54(1): 26-9, abstract available at  ), a large and long-lasting (18 months or longer) monophyletic outbreak of hepatitis A is reported in the Rome metropolitan area (at least since July 2008), involving a high proportion of HIV-infected MSM. All the infections detected in MSM were attributable to a monophyletic strain of HAV, circulating also in other parts of Europe around the same period. Outbreaks like this can take place despite circulation of heterologous HAV strains in the general population. The recommendations for HAV vaccination in susceptible adults from the United States' Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ACIP are to vaccinate any person seeking protection from hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection and people with any of the following indications:  - men who have sex with men;  - people who use injected or non-injected illicit drugs;  - people working with HAV-infected primates or with HAV in a research laboratory setting;  - people with chronic liver disease and people who receive clotting factor concentrates;  - people traveling to or working in countries that have high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A; and  - unvaccinated people who anticipate close personal contact (such as household or regular babysitting) with an international adoptee during the 1st 60 days after arrival in the United States from a country with high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A.

Researchers from the Animal Health Trust (AHT), in partnership with British and Icelandic research and veterinary institutions, have identified the cause of an epidemic of respiratory disease, which infected not only Iceland's native horse population, but also dogs, cats, and humans. The respiratory disease epidemic in early 2010 was characterized by coughing and nasal discharge. The disease spread through the population of 77 000 Icelandic horses within weeks, leading to a self-imposed ban on their export and significant economic cost to the country. Initially, due to the speed at which the disease had spread, a viral cause was suspected. Investigations by researchers at the University of Iceland showed that only _Streptococcus zooepidemicus_, was consistently recovered from coughing horses and rare fatal cases of infection. However, this bacterium was also often found in healthy horses. Scientists from the AHT and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, in Cambridge, England, were brought in to investigate. \"To identify the culprit, we sequenced the DNA from 257 samples of bacteria from diseased animals and people,\" said Simon Harris, BSc, PhD, senior staff scientist at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. \"This showed that one specific strain of _S. zooepidemicus_, called ST209, was the likely culprit, and we also found this strain in a human case of blood poisoning. This study highlights, for the 1st time, how DNA sequencing can be used to identify endemic strains of bacteria and distinguish them from the cause of an epidemic infection.\" Iceland is free of all major equine infectious diseases thanks to the ban on the importation of horses into the country in place since 1882. Consequently, Icelandic horses are particularly susceptible to any new bacteria or virus that cross the border, and so strict biosecurity regulations are in place to help protect them. Sigriour Bjornsdottir, DVM, PhD, of the MAST (Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority), used information from owners and veterinarians to build an epidemiological network. This enabled her to identify an equine rehabilitation center where horses exercised in a water treadmill. The water treadmill is thought to have provided the perfect conditions for transmitting the disease as water was splashed up and ingested. Horses would complete their rehabilitation and return home, while incubating the disease, taking the infection with them. The ST209 strain of _S. zooepidemicus_ found in Iceland has also been recovered from a coughing horse in Sweden and an abdominal abscess in a Finnish horse trainer. \"There are a couple of theories as to how the strain entered Iceland,\" said Andrew Waller, BSc, PhD, head of bacteriology at the AHT. \"These bacteria are able to survive outside a horse for a week or so, which means the import of contaminated equipment or clothing is the most likely route by which ST209 entered Iceland. However, this particular strain could have even infected a human who travelled to Iceland, before spreading the strain back to a horse and triggering the epidemic. \"We are delighted to have helped uncover the likely identity of the cause of this epidemic,\" he continued. \"Our investigation highlights the ability of _S. zooepidemicus_ strains to cause disease in animals and people. We found evidence that even endemic strains of _S. zooepidemicus_ were likely causing cases of respiratory disease in Icelandic horses, illustrating that this group of bacteria causes more clinical problems in horses than was previously thought. We hope that raising awareness of the cause of this epidemic, and the likely involvement of a water treadmill as a key factor in disease transmission, will encourage veterinarians around the world to improve disease control precautions preventing future epidemics.\" The study, \"Genomic Dissection of an Icelandic Epidemic of Respiratory Disease in Horses and Associated Zoonotic Cases,\" was published in mBio.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Icelandic horses have been bred only with local horses since the Middle Ages. Iceland, a remote and isolated island/state, maintains in-bred animal populations (mainly sheep and horses), which are particularly susceptible to exotic disease agents. In sheep, this, combined with the lengthy periods, each winter, of being kept indoors, has led several times in the past to stormy epizootics caused by introduced disease agents which had been known elsewhere, to be slow and limited in spread (such as paratuberculosis, maedi-visna, adenomatosis, and scrapie). In mid-February 1998, an acute febrile disease of horses started in the Reykjavik area, spreading rapidly more or less over Iceland, morbidity being almost 100 percent while mortality not exceeding 0.2 percent. In spite of extensive investigations in Iceland and in laboratories in Sweden, Germany, USA, and UK, the exact nature of the causal agent of this disease was not determined. Electron microscope pictures from the Animal Health trust in UK and the behavior of the disease strongly indicated that it was an enterovirus belonging to the family of picornaviruses. The virus was considered most likely common to horses in Europe and elsewhere without being recognised outside Iceland as a clinical entity (see http://promedmail.org/post/19980811.1576 and other 1998 references in \"see also\" below). The low prevalence of disease in Iceland's horses is maintained by laws preventing horses exported from the country being returned, and by requiring that all equine equipment taken into the country be either new and unused or fully disinfected. As a result, native horses have no acquired immunity to disease. This may explain the 1998 event and the unusual impact of the described 2010 introduction of the exotic strain of _S. zooepidemicus_ (_Streptococcus equi_ subspecies _zooepidemicus_), namely clade 1 (ST209). This strain was identified, according to the paper above (ref 1), in 81 isolates from 45 horses residing at 21 premises across Iceland over a 152-day period between 10 May and 8 Oct 2010. While the route of introduction remains to be speculated, subscribers are referred to the fact that ST209 was also recovered from a human and a cat. _Streptococcus equi_ subspecies _zooepidemicus_ (_S. zooepidemicus_) is, generally, not regarded to have significant impact on international trade, being one of the most common bacteria isolated from respiratory infections in horses worldwide. As its name suggests, _S. zooepidemicus_ is a potentially zoonotic pathogen capable of infecting many mammalian species. There have been a number of documented cases of it being the aetiological agent of acute fatal haemorrhagic pneumonia in dogs (http://promedmail.org/post/20091205.4151 and other 2009 references in \"see also\" below) and serious though rare disease in humans (see http://promedmail.org/post/20091209.4191). The possibility that imported cat(s) may have played a role in the epidemiology of the addressed _S. zooepidemicus_ event in Iceland deserves consideration. In a report on a 2009 outbreak of respiratory disease in a cattery, clinical disease was characterized by purulent nasal discharges and cough, progressing to sinusitis, dyspnea, symptoms of pneumonia and death. Pathological examination revealed different degrees of inflammation of the lower respiratory tract. _S. zooepidemicus_ was the main bacterium isolated. Sequencing of the V2 fragment of the 16S gene revealed that the isolates were distributed in 2 previously described genogroups (ref 2). The horse population of Iceland (2016 figures, OIE) is 67 358, kept in 2329 establishments: a globally exceptionally high density of 0.65 horse per sq/km, as well as a relative high equine/human ratio of 1/5 (Iceland's human population was, in 2016, 334 252).<br><br><strong> References </strong><br> 1.

Last week, fleas collected in the Red Lake area, approximately 5 miles northeast of Williams, tested positive for plague. The tests were conducted by the Center for Pathogen and Microbiome Institute at Northern Arizona University. CCPHSD is notifying area residents, and the rodent burrows, which are located on private property, will be treated. The area will be closely monitored to determine whether further action is required. Because the disease is endemic in Coconino County, there are likely additional locations with infected fleas. CCPHSD Environmental Health staff will continue to collect and test flea samples from locations throughout the county. CCPHSD is urging the public to take precautions to reduce their risk of exposure to this serious disease, which can be present in fleas, rodents, rabbits and predators that feed upon these animals. The disease can be transmitted to humans and other animals by the bite of an infected flea or by direct contact with an infected animal. To limit possible exposure, people are encouraged to avoid rodent burrows and keep dogs on a leash as required by Arizona State law. An abundance of active prairie dogs doesn't indicate disease is present. However, a sudden die-off of prairie dogs and rodents may be an indicator of plague. Persons noticing a sudden die-off of rodents or rabbits are urged to contact CCPHSD Environmental Services at 679-8750. Symptoms of plague in humans generally appear within 2 to 6 days following exposure and include the following: fever, chills, headache, weakness, muscle pain, and swollen lymph glands (called \"buboes\") in the groin, armpits or limbs. The disease can become septicemic (spreading throughout the bloodstream) and/or pneumonic (affecting the lungs) but is curable with proper antibiotic therapy if diagnosed and treated early. It is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, which is mainly spread by the bites of infectious fleas. The bacterium is not native to North America. When it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations. Surveillance efforts testing fleas are very important to detect circulation of _Y. pestis_ and risk of infection. - Mod.PMB   .

The study, published this week in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, found that for 2 out of every 10 000 people with the genetic mutation, it can lead to inflammation of the brain, and for 20 out of every 10 000 people, it can lead to severe pneumonia. Researchers identified a mutation of what is known as the POL III sensor, which the immune system uses to identify the genome of _Varicella zoster_ virus, known as chickenpox. In patients with this mutation, their cells do not detect the infection and did not activate the immune system's response, allowing the virus to spread to the brain. \"We cannot yet put an exact figure on how much the risk of complications is increased when you have this new immunodeficiency, since we have looked at relatively few patients in our study,\" Professor Trine Hyrup Mogensen, from the Department of Clinical Medicine and the Department of Biomedicine at Aarhus University in Denmark, said in a news release. \"Neither do we know how large a proportion of all those who have inflammation of the brain and pneumonia have the defect. But we do know that this applies to both children and adults.\" Patients with mutations in POL III have an increased risk of developing serious, life-threatening illness with the chickenpox virus. At the same time, the last few decades have seen an explosion in our knowledge of the immune system. Together, this means we are now slowly becoming able to understand the individual differences in susceptibility to infections at both the genetic and molecular level,\" S\u00f8ren Riis Paludan, professor at the Department of Biomedicine at Aarhus University, said.

Abstract: \"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) typically causes chickenpox upon primary infection. In rare cases, VZV can give rise to life threatening disease in otherwise healthy people, but the immunological basis for this remains unexplained. We report 4 cases of acute severe VZV infection affecting the central nervous system or the lungs in unrelated, otherwise healthy children who are heterozygous for rare missense mutations in POLR3A (one patient), POLR3C (one patient), or both (two patients). POLR3A and POLR3C encode subunits of RNA polymerase III. Leukocytes from all 4 patients tested exhibited poor IFN induction in response to synthetic or VZV-derived DNA. Moreover, leukocytes from 3 of the patients displayed defective IFN production upon VZV infection and reduced control of VZV replication. These phenotypes were rescued by transduction with relevant WT alleles. This work demonstrates that monogenic or digenic POLR3A and POLR3C deficiencies confer increased susceptibility to severe VZV disease in otherwise healthy children, providing evidence for an essential role of a DNA sensor in human immunity.\"  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\.

However, the level of virus may not be sufficient to cause HBV based on the HBV genotype (Hsia et al, 2006). 2. Is minipool NAT or ID NAT being done for HBV DNA detection by blood banks in Ireland? And if minipool NAT, how many samples were in the minipool since this could compromise sensitivity? 3. Was the archived donor specimen also tested for total anti-HBc, a test done in US blood facilities, but not in Ireland? 4. What is the evidence that the recipient was not previously infected with HBV, while bearing in mind that patients with chronic hepatitis B may be positive for IgM anti-HBc during acute reactivation of their disease. And if the recipient was IgM positive, what was the ratio of the anti-HBc test result based on the cutoff value and the patient's value? 5.

Regarding his questions/comments: 1. As I noted in the moderation of the original post, there is a lesser discussed \"window period\" occurring in the incubation period of acute hepatitis B prior to the development of HBsAg and before the development of anti-HBc (IgM and then IgG). The more classical \"window period\" occurs towards the end of acute hepatitis B, whether clinically overt or not, when HBsAg is not longer detectable by standard assays but before anti-HBs is detectable. The only serologic evidence of HBV is anti-HBc and IgM anti-HBc should be positive. HBV DNA is also detectable. It has been shown that blood transfused during this period can be infectious for HBV. 2-4. All good questions which I cannot supply answers to. 5.

Health Commissioner Eric Zgodinski, of the Toledo-Lucas County Public Health Department, met briefly with media on Thu 10 Aug 2017, saying Mama C's Donuts & Coffee in Maumee, OH remains closed. The owners voluntarily closed on Tue 8 Aug 2017 after health officials notified them of illnesses among customers. By Thursday morning 10 Aug 2017 the victim count was 214. By the time Zgodinski met with reporters later in the day, the number was \"closer to 240.\" He said he is not aware of secondary infections, meaning the sick people did not contract norovirus from contact with other outbreak victims. The doughnut shop owners have been cooperating fully with health inspectors and are working on deep cleaning the business, Zgodinski said. The doughnut makers hired a professional cleaning company for the job. Before Mama C's can resume operations, the health department must sign off regarding cleaning and other conditions. Health department officials became aware of the norovirus outbreak when local hospitals notified them about a number of people who became ill after eating Mama C's food from 4-7 Aug 2017. The health department tested \"specimens\" from the restaurant, Zgodinski said, according to WTOL-TV Channel 11, a CBS affiliate news station in Toledo. Three of the samples were positive for norovirus, WTOL reported. Norovirus illness can make you feel extremely sick with diarrhea and vomiting many times a day, according to the CDC. Norovirus symptoms usually subside after a couple of days. However, it can lead to severe dehydration and serious, sometimes life-threatening illnesses in the elderly or people with suppressed immune systems, according to the CDC. Other important facts about norovirus, as listed by the CDC, include: - It only takes a very small amount of norovirus particles, fewer than 100, to make you sick; - People with norovirus illness shed billions of virus particles in their stool and vomit and can easily infect others; - You are contagious from the moment you begin feeling sick and for the 1st few days after you recover; - Norovirus can spread quickly in enclosed places like daycare centers, nursing homes, schools and cruise ships; - Norovirus can stay on objects and surfaces and still infect people for days or weeks, and - Norovirus can survive some disinfectants, making it hard to get rid of.

It should be noted that the prototypic norovirus, Norwalk virus, was originally isolated in Norwalk, Ohio, obviously the state where an outbreak popped up at the Republican National Convention in 2016. Norovirus infections and outbreaks are usually more common in cooler, winter months. About half of all cases occur from December through February in countries above the equator and June through August in countries below the equator. However, in places closer to the equator, norovirus may be less seasonal. This may be because of temperature or the timing of the rainy season, but may also be associated with the birth rate. Worldwide, norovirus is the leading cause of gastroenteritis outbreaks. New norovirus strains emerge about every 2 to 4 years.

Zika virus (or Zika) has been reported in Tonga. Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in Tonga are infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:  Women who are pregnant:  Do not travel to Tonga.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to Tonga or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers considering pregnancy:  Before you or your partner travel, talk to your health care provider about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection.  Wait before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.  If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex &ndash; or do not have sex &ndash; for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex, or do not have sex, for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy  Talk to your health care provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive.

The disease is rabbit haemorrhagic disease variant 2 (RVHD-2), and it is fatal in approximately 25 percent of rabbits that catch it. Rabbits may die suddenly without any symptoms. Until now, there had been no confirmed cases in the area, but this month July 2017, a young rabbit that died unexpectedly at home was tested for the new virus and has become the 1st confirmed case of RVHD-2 in the Bedford area. The standard UK rabbit vaccination does not protect against RVHD-2; it covers myxomatosis and RVHD-1. Katharine Nelson, Senior Vet at Acorn House Veterinary Hospital, said: \"Vets, pet shops and rabbit owners need to be aware that this new virus is present in the Bedford area. Both indoor and outdoor rabbits are at risk. We recommend that rabbit owners in Bedford contact their local veterinary surgery and make arrangements for their pets to receive the new vaccine.\"  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Up to 2010, all RHD viruses (RHDV) isolated belonged to one of the 6 identified genotypes (GI-GVI), among which the GVI is an antigenic subtype (RHDVa). In 2010, an additional RHDV was identified, phylogenetically and antigenically distinct from RHDV and provisionally called RHDV2 or RHDVb. A similar disease, termed European brown hare syndrome (EBHS), has been described in the hare (_Lepus europaeus_). RHD is characterised by high morbidity and a mortality of 70-90 percent for RHDV/RHDVa and 5-70 percent for RHDV2. Infection mainly occurs by the oral route. In wild rabbits in particular, insects are considered an important route of infection or transmission, and are often the source of long-distance spread. The incubation period of RHD varies from 1 to 3 days, and death usually occurs 12-36 hours after the onset of fever. The main clinical manifestations of the acute infection are nervous and respiratory signs, apathy and anorexia. In rabbits younger than 4-6 weeks, the RHDV/RHDVa infection course is subclinical, but when the causative agent is RHDV2, clinical signs and mortality are observed even in young animals from 15 to 20 days of age onwards. Requirements for vaccines: Indirect control of the disease is easily achieved by vaccination. Although the capsid RHDVs has been expressed as recombinant VPLs, as of 2015 the vaccines used are inactivated vaccine prepared from livers of experimentally infected rabbits, and thus inactivated and adjuvanated. Vaccinated animals quickly produce solid protective immunity against RHDV infection (within 7-10 days), and experimental data indicate that protection lasts for a long period (over 1 year). As RHDV2 is a distant antigenic subtype or even a 2nd RHDV serotype, combined vaccination with both antigenic types, or the use of a vaccine homologous to the RHDV strain identified during the epidemics or the outbreak, is highly advisable.

Till 9 Jul 2017, H1N1 affected 12460 people and caused 600 deaths. The 1st half of 2017 has seen a spurt in the number of deaths and infections caused by influenza A(H1N1), popularly referred to as swine flu in India. Till 9 Jul 2017, H1N1 affected 12 460 people and caused 600 deaths as against 1786 infections and 265 deaths in the whole of last year 2016. Experts are also alarmed that the number is high among young adults. About 40 percent of the deaths and 50 percent of the infections are among people in the 20-50 years age group, with no co-morbid conditions. Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, Maharashtra, said this could be because young people move a lot, and are therefore vulnerable to swine flu influenza A/H1N1pdm09, which is an air-borne infection. His state has topped the list in the country with 2324 cases and 284 deaths so far. Authorities blamed it on indiscriminate testing, even when unnecessary by private laboratories. \"Flu outbreaks offer people a herd immunity that lasts for a year or 2. Since Maharashtra had fewer cases in 2016, there is a higher number this year 2017,\" Dr Awate said. What is encouraging, according to experts, is that the situation no longer demands isolating H1N1-positive people as was done to contain the spread in 2009, when the virus was new to India and affected close to 50 000 people and killed more than 2700.<br><br><strong> Antigenic shift -</strong><br> The National Institute of Virology, NIV Pune, ruled out mutation theory and some experts believe that the jump in numbers could be attributed to 2 factors: antigenic drift and the spread of a different strain (sub-type of virus) of H1N1 virus. According to the US Centres of Disease Control, \"antigenic drift are small changes in the genes of influenza viruses that happen continually over time as the virus replicates. These small genetic changes usually produce viruses that are closely related to one another... and an immune system exposed to a similar virus will usually recognise it and respond. But these small genetic changes can accumulate over time and result in viruses that are antigenically different.... When this happens, the body's immune system may not recognise those viruses.\" Dr Chand Wattal, honorary consultant in clinical microbiology at New Delhi's Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, however, said antigenic drift was not a major issue. \"If the virus mutates, then we consider it a problem.<br><br><strong>\" The Michigan strain -</strong><br> On the other hand, the studies point towards a new strain of H1N1 virus: the Michigan strain, which has been in circulation since the end of 2016 and has replaced the earlier California strain. NIV says it is not more virulent than the California strain. \"Before the H1N1 came to India in 2009, H3N2 was the dominant flu strain since 1919. Now it is H1N1, and till everyone has immunity, waxing and waning of cases and deaths will happen,\" said a researcher from National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). \"Also, if we compare deaths reported due to communicable diseases such as TB tuberculosis or diarrhoea, the influenza A(H1N1)-related deaths are much lower,\" he said. The World Health Organisation has also recommended a vaccine for the new strain, named as A/Michigan/45/2015 to replace A/California/7/2009.<br><br><strong> Testing for flu -</strong><br> The government's guidelines do not recommend anyone with fever to be randomly tested, and divides cases in 3 categories  a, b and, c, wherein category 'a' is of people who experience mild symptoms, category 'b' is people with moderate symptoms, and 'c' are those with severe symptoms. They recommended use of medicines in category 'b' and 'c' patients, as those with mild symptoms are capable of recovering at home with symptomatic treatment, and treatment if symptoms are serious and the person has difficulty breathing.<br><br><strong> Vaccines and medicines </strong><br> On the new vaccine recommended by WHO, Dr Soumya Swaminathan, director of the Indian Council of Medical Research said it was needed as the current one \"may be ineffective\". Though no vaccine provides 100 percent protection, it is advisable to take a shot if one is at high risk, especially if suffering from diabetes, hypertension, on immunosuppressants, cancer treatment, etc. The Drug Controller General of India (DGCI) recently eased norms for the sale of anti-viral medicine Oseltamivir and Zanamivir, which are used to treat influenza A/H1N1pdm09. The sale so far was restricted to only a handful of chemists until now, but the new notification allows more pharmacies to sell the medicine. However, a signed and stamped prescription from a registered medical practitioner is still needed to buy the medicine over the counter. Byline: Rhythma Kaul  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ For the 2016-17 influenza vaccine for the southern hemisphere, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended changing only the 2009 H1N1 component with A/Michigan/45/2015, which replaces the longstanding A/California/7/2009 and is recommended to improve protection against 2 subclades that have emerged over the past season. The WHO group also noted that an analysis of 2009 H1N1 samples collected from February to August 2016 had shown that the vast majority fell into clade 6B, with most belonging to subclade 6B.1 and a small proportion, mostly from China, belonging to subclade 6B.2. Routine testing based on ferret sera suggested that recently circulating 2009 H1N1 viruses were antigenically indistinguishable from the longstanding vaccine virus strain. Tests using human sera from vaccinated people of different age-groups, however, found a potential gap in protection among adult samples, with potentially an even more significant protection drop for children's samples ( ). However, the seasonal flu vaccines for the northern hemisphere for the 2016-17 season contained the A/California/7/2009 vaccine strain. On 2 Mar 2017, the WHO flu vaccine advisory group issued the recommended composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2017-2018 northern hemisphere influenza season. It announced that the Michigan strain would replace the California strain in the northern hemisphere as well ( ) and would become available later this year (2017). -Mod.UBA ", "dates": ["Date: Mon 17 Jul 2017 7:14 PM HKT", "a series of measures announced by the authority on [Mon 17 Jul 2017]", "Protection said on [Mon 17 Jul 2017]", "[Sun 16 Jul 2017]", "deaths reported as of last week [week of 10 Jul 2017]", "Date: Mon 17 Jul 2017 09:12 IST", " Till [9 Jul 2017]", "H1N1 affected 12460 people and caused 600 deaths", "The 1st half of 2017 has seen a spurt in the number of deaths and", " Till [9 Jul 2017] H1N1 affected 12 460 people and", "caused 600 deaths as against 1786 infections and 265 deaths in the", "His state has topped the list in the country with 2324 cases and 284", "to 50 000 people and killed more than 2700", "the H1N1 came to India in 2009 H3N2 was the dominant flu strain since", "A/Michigan/45/2015 to replace A/California/7/2009", "[For the 2016-17 influenza vaccine for the southern hemisphere the", "H1N1 component with A/Michigan/45/2015 which replaces the", "longstanding A/California/7/2009 and is recommended to improve", "The WHO group also noted that an analysis of 2009 H1N1 samples", "circulating 2009 H1N1 viruses were antigenically indistinguishable", "2016-17 season contained the A/California/7/2009 vaccine strain", "composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2017-2018"], "title": "Influenza (14): Hong Kong, India "}, "716": {"sentences": "OMS | D\u00e9terminants sociaux de la sant\u00e9  Aller au contenu principal  Access  Home Alt+0  Navigation Alt+1  Content Alt+2  Chercher  Rechercher sur WHO.int  Submit  Recherche avanc\u00e9e  Navigation  Page d'accueil  Th&egrave;mes de sant&eacute;  Donn&eacute;es et statistiques  Centre des m&eacute;dias  Publications  Pays  Programmes et projets  Gouvernance  &Agrave; propos de l'  OMS  Language  \u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a  \u4e2d\u6587  English  Fran\u00e7ais  \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439  Espa\u00f1ol  D\u00e9terminants sociaux de la sant\u00e9  Rubriques  D\u00e9terminants sociaux de la sant\u00e9  La Commission  D\u00e9terminants sociaux de la sant\u00e9  Les d\u00e9terminants sociaux de la sant\u00e9 sont les circonstances dans lesquelles les individus naissent, grandissent, vivent, travaillent et vieillissent ainsi que les syst\u00e8mes mis en place pour faire face \u00e0 la maladie.

The Nigerian Ministry of Health has reported several cases of poliovirus in the state of Borno in northeastern Nigeria. The Nigerian government is conducting widespread immunizations to prevent further transmission.  CDC recommends that all travelers to Nigeria be fully vaccinated against polio. In addition, adults who have been fully vaccinated should receive a single lifetime booster dose of polio vaccine.  Because of the risk of cross-border transmission, CDC recommends a one-time booster dose of polio vaccine for fully vaccinated adults traveling to Niger, Cameroon, or Chad to work in healthcare facilities, refugee camps, or other humanitarian aid settings. This kind of work might put people in contact with someone who has polio.  What is polio?  Polio is a disease caused by a virus that affects the nervous system. It is spread by person-to-person contact, mainly through exposure to the feces of an infected person. You could also get polio by drinking water or other drinks or eating raw or undercooked food that has been contaminated by the feces of an infected person.  Most people with polio do not feel sick. Some people have only minor symptoms, such as fever, tiredness, nausea, headache, nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, stiffness in the neck and back, and pain in the arms and legs. Most people recover completely. In rare cases, polio infection causes permanent loss of muscle function in the arms or legs (usually the legs); if there is loss of function of the muscles used for breathing or an infection of the brain, death can occur.  What can travelers do to prevent polio?  Get the polio vaccine:  Ask your doctor or nurse to find out if you are up to date with your polio vaccination and whether you need a booster dose before traveling. Even if you were vaccinated as a child or have been sick with polio before, you may need a booster dose to make sure that you are protected. See individual destination pages for vaccine recommendations.  Make sure children are vaccinated.  See the Polio Vaccine Information Statement for more information.  Eat foods and drink beverages that are considered safe: Follow CDC&rsquo;s Food and Water Safety tips to avoid eating or drinking things that could be contaminated with poliovirus.  Practice hygiene and cleanliness :  Wash your hands often.  If soap and water aren&rsquo;t available, clean your hands with hand sanitizer (containing at least 60% alcohol).  Don&rsquo;t touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. If you need to touch your face, make sure your hands are clean.  Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.  Try to avoid close contact, such as kissing, hugging, or sharing eating utensils or cups, with people who are sick.  Traveler Information  CDC Polio Homepage  Polio Vaccine Information Statement  Food and Water Safety  Clinician Information  All travelers to any country should be up to date on routine vaccinations, including polio vaccine. CDC recommends a single lifetime inactivated polio vaccine booster dose for travelers to certain countries.

The patients, some on stretchers and wheelchairs, left the hospital in Yau Ma Tei separately in 2 groups in the morning, both sent by non-emergency ambulances, and arrived at St Teresa's in Kowloon City. They came from the orthopaedics, gynaecology, and surgical wards. \"I think the facilities at St Teresa's are better,\" a patient, 26, said. The arrangement is part of a plan to share the burden of public hospitals, which have had an influx of inpatients during the summer flu peak period. Other measures include asking doctors serving the Department of Health to work part-time at public hospitals and adding 8000 places at public outpatient clinics by September 2017. Latest statistics from the department showed 372 severe flu cases, including 249 deaths, had been recorded since May 2017. In total 48 beds have been made available in St Teresa's until the end of September 2017 for public hospital patients, who would be eligible for transfer if they were in stable condition when recovering from surgery. Queen Elizabeth, the 1st public hospital to send patients to a private institution under the scheme, had a bed occupancy rate of 117 percent in its medical ward on Tue 25 Jul 2017, higher than the overall rate of 109 per cent. Signs at its accident and emergency ward in the morning showed that non-urgent patients had to wait over 2 hours to be treated. The supply of beds at the medical ward remained \"tight\", with patients needing to wait over 5 hours to be admitted. Byline: Elizabeth Cheung, Brian Wong  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. In the previous ProMED post dated 19 Jul 2017 (http://promedmail.org/post/20170719.5184913), influenza A/H3N2 was reported to be causing the majority of seasonal influenza cases. From this report, it seems that the percentage of severe cases with a fatal outcome is quite high (66.9 percent) and merits further investigation.

In total, cases have been reported from 27 countries in the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, the United States of America, and Asia (Table 1). Males above the age of 60 with underlying conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension and renal failure, are at a higher risk of severe disease, including death. To date, at least 710 individuals have died (crude CFR 34.8 percent). Since the last global update published on 5 Dec 2016, 199 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV from 4 countries were reported to WHO (190 from Saudi Arabia, 3 from Qatar, 4 from the United Arab Emirates, 1 from Lebanon and 1 from Oman), of whom 58 (29.2 percent) have died. Among these cases, 72.9 percent were male and the median age was 54-years-old (IQR 39-65). At the time of writing, 59 of 199 (29.6 percent) patients were reported as asymptomatic or having mild disease and 80 (40.2 percent) had severe disease and/or died. At least one underlying condition was reported in 114 cases (57.3 percent) since the last update, including chronic renal failure (11.4 percent), heart disease (12.3 percent), diabetes mellitus (71.0 percent), and hypertension (67.5 percent). One pregnant woman was also reported and, at the time of writing, had lost her baby and was on mechanical ventilation in an ICU. Overall, the epidemiology, transmission patterns, clinical presentation of MERS patients and viral characteristics reported since the last update are consistent with past patterns described in previous WHO risk assessments: MERS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that has repeatedly entered the human population via direct or indirect contact with infected dromedary camels in the Arabian Peninsula. Limited, non-sustained human-to-human transmission in health-care settings continue to occur, primarily in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, due to the non-specificity of MERS symptoms resulting in late diagnosis of MERS. The risk of exported cases to areas outside of the Middle East due to travel remains significant. While there have been significant improvements in surveillance for MERS, especially in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and in reacting to suspect clusters, early identification in the community and in health-care systems, compliance with the infection prevention and control measures and contact follow up remain major challenges for MERS outbreak prevention and control. The continued importance of MERS-CoV in healthcare-settings: Since the last global update of 5 Dec 2016, approximately 31 percent of cases reported to WHO were associated with transmission in a health-care facility. These cases included health-care workers (40 cases), patients sharing rooms/wards with MERS patients, or family visitors. Though not unexpected, these transmission events continue to be deeply concerning, given that MERS-CoV is still a relatively rare disease about which medical personnel in health-care facilities have low awareness. Globally, awareness for MERS-CoV is low and, because symptoms of MERS-CoV infection are non-specific, initial cases are sometimes easily missed. With improved compliance in infection prevention and control, namely adherence to the standard precautions at all times, human-to-human transmission in health-care facilities can be reduced and possibly eliminated with additional use of transmission-based precautions. Since the last update, several health-care-associated MERS outbreaks have occurred, including the following:  - An outbreak of MERS occurred in a hospital in Riyadh City, Riyadh in June 2017. From 1 Jun-3 Jul 2017, 34 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported to WHO. The initial case was a 47-year-old male who required emergency intubation in the emergency department, prior to identification of being infected with MERS-CoV. Prior to diagnosis, more than 220 health-care workers, patients and visitor contacts were identified for follow-up from contact with this patient. Extensive contact tracing, follow-up and laboratory testing identified an additional 33 cases during this outbreak. Overall, the cases associated with this outbreak had a median age of 34.5-years-old (IQR 30-54), are predominantly male (58.8 percent) and half were health care workers (50.0 percent). Eleven patients were classified as having severe disease, of whom 7 died, and 22 were asymptomatic.  - One case from the cluster described above also sought treatment (renal dialysis) at a 2nd health-care facility in Riyadh City, Riyadh in June 2017. Within this healthcare facility, 5 additional cases were identified. Transmission occurred among 3 household contacts, one patient contact in the hospital, and one health-care worker contact.  - Also in June 2017, an unrelated MERS cluster occurred in a hospital in Riyadh City, Riyadh. This cluster involved 9 cases: the 1st case who reported direct contact to dromedary camels (occupational exposure as a butcher) and 8 health-care worker contacts (4 were reported as asymptomatic and 4 reported mild disease). In March and April 2017, 2 unlinked clusters of MERS occurred at the same hospital in Wadi Aldwaser city, Riyadh Region.  - A cluster of MERS occurred in March 2017. This cluster included 10 laboratory-confirmed patients, 40 percent of whom were male, 20 percent of whom were health-care workers and 40 percent of whom were reported as asymptomatic. The source of infection in the initially-identified patient was under investigation and transmission occurred in a renal dialysis unit within this hospital and between household contacts.  - A cluster of MERS occurred in April 2017. This cluster involved 5 laboratory-confirmed cases: the initial case, 3 household contacts and one health-care worker. The apparent increase in the number of asymptomatic contacts identified in health-care settings are being identified due to a policy change by the Ministry of Health of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in which all high-risk contacts are tested for MERS-CoV regardless of the development of symptoms. Drivers of transmission and the exact modes of transmission in health-care settings have not been articulated and are currently the focus of collaborative scientific research. From observational studies, transmission in health-care settings is believed to have occurred before adequate infection prevention and control procedures were applied and cases were isolated. Investigations at the time of the outbreaks indicate that aerosolizing procedures conducted in crowded emergency departments or medical wards with sub-optimal infection prevention and control measures in place resulted in human-to-human transmission and environmental contamination. Community-acquired cases and reported links to dromedary camels: Since the last update, 56 human cases are believed to have been infected in the community. Of these 56 reported cases, 47 (89.9 percent) reported direct or indirect contact with dromedaries in Saudi Arabia (45 cases), Qatar (1 case) and the United Arab Emirates (1 case). Improvement in multi-sectoral investigation of community-acquired cases is evident, including testing of dromedary animals/herds in the vicinity of community-acquired cases and follow-up of human contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases. The Ministries of Health in affected countries notify the Ministries of Agriculture when human cases report a link with animals. Investigations in animals are carried out by officials from the Ministries of Agriculture and results, if positive for MERS-CoV, are reported to OIE. Exported cases identified outside the Middle East: Since the last update, no cases have been reported outside of the Middle East. Summary - information available from 2012 to date: Thus far, no sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred anywhere in the world, however limited no sustained human-to-human transmission in health-care facilities remains a prominent feature of this virus. WHO continues to work with health authorities in the affected countries. WHO understands that health authorities in affected countries, especially those in the most affected countries, are aggressively investigating cases and contacts, including testing for MERS-CoV among asymptomatic contacts, and applying mitigation measures to stop human-to-human transmission in health-care settings. Of all laboratory-confirmed cases reported to date (n=2040), the median age is 52 (IQR 36-65; range >1-109-years-old) and 66.4 percent are male. At the time of reporting, 21.5 percent of the 2040 cases were reported to have no or mild symptoms, while 46.8 percent had severe disease or died. Overall, 19.6 percent of the cases reported to date have been in health-care workers. Since 2012, 27 countries have reported cases of MERS-CoV infection. In the Middle East: Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen; in Africa: Algeria and Tunisia; in Europe: Austria, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey and the United Kingdom; in Asia: China, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand; and in the Americas: the United States of America (Table 1 see source URL). The majority of cases (approximately 82 percent) have been reported from Saudi Arabia (Figure 1 see source URL). Populations in close contact with dromedaries (e.g. farmers, abattoir workers, shepherds, dromedary owners) and healthcare workers caring for MERS-CoV patients are believed to be at higher risk of infection. Healthy adults tend to have mild subclinical or asymptomatic infections. To date, limited human-to-human transmission has occurred between close contacts of confirmed cases in household settings. More efficient human-to-human transmission occurs in health-care settings due to inadequate and/or incomplete compliance with the infection prevention and control measures and delay in triage or isolation of suspected MERS patients. Health-care-associated transmission has been documented in several countries between 2012-2016, including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, France, the United Kingdom, and the Republic of Korea with varying outbreak sizes (2-180 reported cases per outbreak). The largest outbreak outside of the Middle East occurred in the Republic of Korea resulting in 186 cases (including one case who travelled to China) and 38 deaths. Overall, the reproduction number (R0) of MERS-CoV is 1, but they can be brought under control (R The above report is a very helpful up-to-date presentation of the current global picture with MERS-CoV and what is known to date on the epidemiology.

The health department says they work closely with the fair on preventative measures, such as hand washing stations and signs at the event. Health officials say it is not uncommon to see _E. coli_ outbreaks surrounding a fair because of the animals there. Health officials say _E. coli_ can have an incubation period of 10 days, and we now are past that threshold. That means they don't anticipate any more primary cases of the disease, but do encourage people to wash their hands to prevent it from spreading. \"Washing hands is one thing, but something people don't think is if you have a stroller, don't push it into the pen,\" explained Jeff Kuhr, the director of Mesa County Public Health. \"Then you have contaminated wheels and you're pushing it through your house.\" They are investigating the current cases to pinpoint the exact source of the disease.

ProMED-mail would appreciate more information about this outbreak. Summer time fairs which contain petting zoos are a well described reservoir for human infection related to direct or indirect exposure to farm animals particularly cattle. The CDC ( ) has offered this advice regarding human-livestock interactions: \"From watching calf roping at the rodeo to petting lambs at the county fair, there are many ways to explore the animal world this spring and summer. Exhibits such as petting zoos and fairs allow children of all ages to have the thrilling experience of coming face to face with animals. This interaction allows people to learn more about animals and helps to build an important human-animal bond. \"Unfortunately, many people become sick every year because of a visit to an animal exhibit. It is important to remember that animals sometimes carry germs that are harmful to humans. When people forget to wash their hands after petting an animal or bring food into an area where animals are being housed, they are at risk for becoming ill. \"If you are visiting an animal exhibit: - use hand-washing stations; - find out where hand-washing stations are located; - always wash your hands after petting animals or touching the animal enclosure, especially before eating and drinking; - running water and soap are best. Use hand gels if running water and soap are not available. \"Food and drinks: - keep food and drinks out of animal areas; - do not share your food with animals; - do not eat or drink raw (unpasteurized) dairy products. \"Children: - children younger than 5 years old need supervision; - never allow children to put their hands or objects (for example, pacifiers) in their mouths while interacting with animals; - hand washing should be supervised.\" - Mod.LL ", "dates": ["Date: Thu 10 Aug 2017 9:44 PM"], "title": "E. coli EHEC - USA (24): (CO) county fair, RFI "}, "219": {"sentences": "   Tue 18 Jul 2017 Source: 7th space edited The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department today Tue 18 Jul 2017 called on the public to stop consuming a batch of prepackaged porcini mushrooms as the product is suspected to contain a mixture of species including inedible or poisonous species.<br><br><strong> Product details are as follows: -</strong><br> Product: Porcini mushrooms Place of origin: China Net weight: 150 grams per pack Best-before date: 30 Mar 2018 A CFS spokesman said, \"Following up on a food poisoning case in relation to the consumption of porcini mushrooms as notified by the Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health, the CFS conducted an investigation at a department store in Yau Ma Tei. According to the information provided by the department store concerned, the sale of the product has ceased since the end of June this year 2017.\" The spokesman further said, \"The CFS has also followed up with Addison Industrial (Group) Limited, the importer and packer of the product concerned. The investigation showed that the affected batch of product was only for sale at the above-mentioned department store. The Centre has requested the importer concerned to stop sales and initiate a recall of the affected batch of the product. Members of the public may call its hotline at 2418 2016 during office hours for inquiries about the recall.\" The CFS appealed to members of the public who have purchased and still possess the affected batch of the product to stop consuming it, and to seek medical advice immediately if symptoms develop after consuming the food. The CFS will alert the trade to the incident, and continue to follow up and take appropriate action. The investigation is ongoing. Mushroom poisoning is generally acute and manifested by a variety of symptoms, depending on the species and amount consumed. The incubation period is usually short. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain are the commonest symptoms. Sometimes distinguishing features such as extreme thirst, profuse sweating, hallucination, coma and other neurological symptoms may occur. Furthermore, consumers are advised to heed the following points when buying and eating fresh mushrooms: - Do not buy mushroom products which are suspected to include a mix of unknown species; - Do not buy mushrooms which look unhygienic (with growing substrates left with the product) or show signs of spoilage (with coloured spots/abnormal smell/slime, etc); - Wash and cook mushrooms thoroughly before consumption; and - Seek medical treatment immediately if mushroom poisoning is suspected.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\.

On 26 Jul 2017, some 18 people including children visited the emergency unit at the national referral hospital in Thimphu complaining of vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. The family had a birthday celebration the previous day 25 Jul 2017. Of the 25 people at the celebration, 17 who ate the birthday cake, and one who did not eat the cake fell sick. The cake was bought from a bakery in Thimphu. The hospital informed the Royal Centre for Disease Control (RCDC) of the suspected food poisoning case, which then informed the Bhutan Agriculture and Food Regulatory Authority (BAFRA). Another 7 people with similar symptoms were admitted to the hospital on 27 Jul 2017 when BAFRA and RCDC officials were questioning the patients of the earlier incident. On investigation, it was found that these 7 people had also eaten cakes from the same bakery on 26 Jul 2017. Of the 8 in the family, the one who did not eat the cake did not fall sick. BAFRA's deputy chief regulatory and quarantine officer, Sithar Dorjee, said the authority investigated the food items that members of both families had consumed: \"Other food items were not found to have significance on their illness.\" Besides the samples of cakes consumed by the 2 families, samples of cakes on sale and those left by the customers in the bakery were sent to RCDC and the National Food Testing Laboratory in Yusipang on 27 Jul 2017 for testing. Sithar Dorji said that although the laboratory did not confirm that the families fell ill because of the cake, BAFRA temporarily closed the bakery to prevent further cases since the clinical epidemiological evidence is linked to the bakery. The authority has seized the cakes from the bakery and disposed of them. A notification was served to rectify some non-compliance issues on the requirements regarding food hygiene and safety. BAFRA's director general, Namgay Wangchuk said, \"When it comes to food safety, we cannot compromise.\" The results from the samples confirmed the presence of the bacterium salmonella, which was also found in the stool and vomit of the patients, Sithar Dorjee said. \"Salmonella bacteria might have come from the egg used in cakes or contaminated from a person.\" Sithar Dorjee said the RCDC might send the result abroad for serotyping since there is no facility in the country to test if the bacteria were from the eggs or contaminated by food handlers. He said the bakery had sold 13 cakes of the same kind to the 2 families over the 2 days. \"The 2 cakes might have not been properly stored for longer period of time before consuming, which resulted in the multiplication of the bacteria or maybe people did not report the illness.\" He also said that the cake topping is most likely to be contaminated since raw egg white is used for toppings. If there is infection in poultry, then the eggs will also be infected thereby contaminating the cake. Eggs from the same farm are also being tested for the bacterium. Food poisoning can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites at any stage such as when they are growing, packaged, stored, shipped, or cooked. Certain food like raw eggs and uncooked meat are more likely to harbour harmful agents. The chances of getting food poisoning are higher in summer and food can start to spoil within an hour when exposed to extreme heat. BAFRA has taken some corrective and precautionary measures to prevent contamination. The workers at the bakery were also provided food handler's training that includes food hygiene and proper storage. \"The bakery will be allowed to reopen once they comply with all required corrective measures because it is contamination,\" he sic said. \"However, we will increase the frequency of inspection of the bakery.\" The authority inspected the bakery about a month ago. Sithar Dorjee said the frequency of inspection depends on the risks. \"If a restaurant or bakery has a history of non-compliance to the authority's requirement on food hygiene and safety, we will frequently inspect.\" The bakery owner said he is yet to know the findings of the test so he couldn't comment. However, he said that if people fall ill after eating cake from his bakery then he could be at fault. But, since the cakes were taken out of the bakery, improper storage or keeping the cake in a vehicle for a longer time could also contaminate the cake. He said that since the affected families had a birthday celebration, other food items could also have caused food poisoning. \"We maintain proper storage of our products.\" Meanwhile, on 28 Jul 2017, about 15 monks of Talo monastery in Punakha district visited the Punakha district hospital after suffering from vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps. Of the total, 10 monks were admitted to the hospital then. Currently, there are 2 monks admitted in the hospital. Punakha district health officer, Dechenmo, said the monks said that they started falling ill after they ate a cake offered to the monastery by some devotees during the 1st Sermon of Lord Buddha on 27 Jul 2017. According to the monks, 2 cakes were offered to the monastery and those who ate the small cake fell ill while those who consumed the other cake did not fall sick. Dechenmo said that the 2 monks who are still in the hospital are recovering and will be discharged from the hospital in a few days. \"We cannot investigate the source of the cake because we don't know who offered the cake to the monastery.\" The health assistant of Nubgang BHU visited the monastery and disinfected all toilets. The monks were also educated on the prevention of the disease. \"The monks came to the hospital at the right time and everything was under control,\" Dechenmo said. \"If we are not careful and not treated on time, then food poisoning can be fatal.\" byline: Dechen Tshomo  communicated by: ProMED-SoAs By definition, baked goods by being baked should be free of bacterial risk but the products can still be the reservoir of foodborne illness. This can occur if the product is undercooked or if icing or filling, which might be placed after baking, is the contaminated substance. The contamination may be from a component of the icing or filling or be contaminated from a bakery worker.

This is the 1st year that the mosquitoborne disease has been detected in the state, with a total of 3 cases so far. But state epidemiologist Dr Siiri Bennett says it's unclear whether the virus is more common, or it's been detected through better testing. \"We just have to be really cautious when there are mosquitoes are around,\" says Bennett. \"Use the insect repellant; cover up; make sure you are aware of what you can do to prevent bites.\" Jamestown Canyon is an arboviral disease, as are West Nile virus and eastern equine encephalitis virus. They can cause flu-like symptoms as well as encephalitis and meningitis. Dr Bennett says Mainers should take precautions to prevent these Jamestown Canyon and other mosquitoborne diseases. \"Wear long sleeves, long trousers, use insect repellent,\" she says. \"Get rid of standing water on your property. According to an additional report from the Maine Center for Disease Control on 21 Aug 2017, one case is in Franklin County. The other is a New Hampshire resident.

In July (2017), a Kennebec County, Maine man was hospitalized for the rare virus. The virus is endemic across the northern tier of states in the USA and probably in southern Canada as well. As noted in previous ProMED-mail posts, JCV was 1st isolated from a pool of 9 _Culiseta inornata_ mosquitoes captured in Jamestown Canyon, Colorado, in 1961 and later shown to be widely distributed in eastern and midwestern USA. Boreal northern _Aedes_ and _Ochlerotatus_ mosquitoes are the primary vectors. As with the other California serogroup Orthobunyaviruses, transovarial virus transmission is common, with newly emerging female mosquitoes already infected with the virus in the spring and ready to transmit the virus.

Dr. Lori Patterson, infectious disease physician at the hospital, said doctors there have seen 7 children in 4 weeks with La Crosse encephalitis. Typically, Tennessee sees a dozen cases of the virus in a year. Though Zika and West Nile viruses get more publicity, La Crosse encephalitis is the state's and the country's most common cause of mosquito-borne illness. The virus, which occurs more frequently in children 16 and younger, irritates the brain; symptoms can include headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness and dizziness, and in severe cases, seizures or coma. There's no vaccine or specific treatment for the virus itself; supportive care  treating symptoms  usually requires hospitalization. La Crosse encephalitis is diagnosed by blood test and is reportable to the state health department and the federal government. Patterson said Tuesday 8 Aug 2017 that the 7 hospital patients' diagnoses were confirmed. The state department of health hasn't provided a statewide number of cases for this year 2017, though East Tennessee typically sees far more cases than the rest of the state. All 3 of last year's 2016 confirmed cases were in this region, one each in Jefferson, Sevier and Hamblen counties. And East Tennessee and Appalachia are hotbeds for the virus, accounting for more than a quarter of cases nationally. Between 2004-2013, only North Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia had more cases than Tennessee's 105, all but a few in the eastern part of the state. Most states reported no cases. In addition to the eastern treehole mosquito _Ochlerotatus (Aedes) triseriatus_, which can breed in as little as a tablespoon of water, the Asian tiger and Asian bush mosquitoes also carry La Crosse encephalitis, researchers at the University of Tennessee and in North Carolina confirmed in 2001. Not only are those 2 non-native species of mosquito prevalent in this area now, they're aggressive biters, said Dr. Rebecca Trout Fryxell, an entomologist and assistant professor at the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture. And all 3 species bite during the day. \"Last year 2016, our mosquito populations were increasing in abundance until the drought occurred in mid-July 2016,\" Fryxell said. \"This year 2017, we have yet to see the mosquito populations peak and start to decline; they've continued to increase overall and at each trap site,\" she said. Knox County sprays for the _Culex_ mosquito, which carries West Nile virus, in neighborhoods where trapped mosquitoes test positive for West Nile, usually a handful a year. But the chemicals used  a mixture of synthetic permethrin and piperonyl butoxide  don't affect the eastern treehole mosquito, which likes wooded areas and lays eggs in tiny hollows, or the non-native species. And while the _Culex_ mosquito is more active at night, atmospheric conditions make spraying ineffective during daylight hours, when the Asian tiger and Asian bush mosquitoes are biting. What can make a difference is applying a repellent containing the chemical compound DEET, or oil of lemon eucalyptus, and dressing children in long sleeves and long pants when possible, health officials said. Keeping grass and shrubbery short, ridding your property of dead trees, filling in hollow stumps with sand or concrete, and dumping standing water around your property  even the little bit that collects under flowerpots or on trash-can lids or pool covers  also can help, as can treating water in birdbaths and landscaping pools with \"mosquito dunks\" available at hardware and farm stores Discarded vehicle tires also accumulate water and can serve as effective breeding sites for the eastern treehole mosquito. - Mod.TY. \"August and September are always bad mosquito months,\" Fryxell said. Byline: Kristi L Nelson  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. As noted in the above report, eastern Tennessee is one of the focal La Crosse virus (LACV) endemic areas. Clinical encephalitis caused by La Crosse virus is most common in pre-school aged children, and cases in adults are somewhat unusual. It is seldom fatal, but significant hospital stays may occur, and there may be neurological sequelae. Cases may occur earlier in the summer season than other arthropod-borne viruses because the virus can be transovarially transmitted by the infected female to her eggs, so that emerging adults may already be infected and ready to transmit the virus without the need to take an infectious blood meal from an infected forest mammal. The mosquito involved mainly is day-biting _Ochlerotatus (Aedes) triseriatus_, the reservoir of the virus maintained through transovarial transmission. As noted in earlier comments, LACV is a member of the California serogroup of arboviruses. There are scattered cases in other states in the eastern USA.

A measles outbreak has been reported in Guinea, with 13 of the country&rsquo;s 33 prefectures affected. They are Conakry, Coyah, Boffa, Dubr&eacute;ka, For&eacute;cariah, Fria, Kindia, N&#39;Z&eacute;r&eacute;kor&eacute;, Gu&eacute;ck&eacute;dou, Siguiri, Dalaba, Kankan, and Bok&eacute;. Guinea&rsquo;s Ministry of Health, assisted by international health and relief agencies, is undertaking response activities to control the outbreak.  CDC recommends that travelers to Guinea protect themselves by making sure they are vaccinated against measles, particularly infants 6&ndash;11 months of age (1 dose of measles vaccine) and children 12 months of age or older (2 doses of measles vaccine). Clinicians should keep measles in mind when treating patients with fever and rash, especially if the patient has recently traveled internationally.  What can travelers do to protect themselves?  Get measles vaccine  People who cannot show that they were vaccinated as children and who have never had measles should be vaccinated.  Infants 6&ndash;11 months of age should have 1 dose of measles vaccine if traveling internationally.  Children in the United States routinely receive measles vaccination at 12&ndash;15 months of age.  Infants vaccinated before age 12 months should be revaccinated on or after the first birthday with 2 doses, separated by at least 28 days.  Children 12 months of age or older should have 2 doses, separated by at least 28 days.  Adolescents and adults who have not had measles and have not been vaccinated should get 2 doses, separated by at least 28 days.  Two doses of measles vaccine are nearly 100% effective at preventing measles. Measles vaccine has been used safely and effectively since the 1970s. A few people experience mild, temporary adverse reactions, such as joint pain, from the vaccine, but serious side effects are extremely rare. There is no known link between vaccines and autism.  See MMR Vaccine Information Statement or MMRV Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) for more information.  Practice hygiene and cleanliness  Wash your hands often.  If soap and water aren&rsquo;t available, clean your hands with hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.  Don&rsquo;t touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. If you need to touch your face, make sure your hands are clean.  Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.  Try to avoid close contact, such as kissing, hugging, or sharing eating utensils or cups, with people who are sick.  If you feel sick and think you may have measles:  Talk to your doctor or nurse if you feel seriously ill, especially if you have a fever.  Tell your healthcare provider about your travel.

They said at least 26 cattle heads had been killed and several others infected by the disease in the 2 mountainous subdivisions. The locals said the disease had spread fear and panic among them. Meanwhile, sources in the local livestock department confirmed the death of cattle due to the outbreak of anthrax. They said teams had been dispatched to the affected areas to administer anti-anthrax vaccines to animals. For a description of Bajaur, go to  Bajaur is on the NE border of Pakistan with Afghanistan. \"Bajaur is inhabited almost exclusively by Tarkani (Tarkalani) Pashtuns, and there are their main sub-tribes in Bajaur: Utman Khel, Tarkalanri, Mamund (Kakazai, Wur, and Salarzai) as well as a small population of Safis. The Utman Khel are at the south east of Bajaur, while Mamund are at the south west, and the Tarkani are at the north of Bajaur. Its border with Afghanistan's Kunar province makes it of strategic importance to Pakistan and the region.\" In June 2017, the veterinary service was vaccinating livestock in Toda Cheena area of central Kurram Agency of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, in response to a suspected outbreak of anthrax; see 11 Jun 2017 Anthrax - Pakistan (02): (TA) livestock vaccinated http://promedmail.org/post/20170611.5098784. This was well received by the locals and that experience will have aided the reporting of cattle deaths in the Mamond and Salarzai sub districts.

The steep increase, the highest number of cases in one week since 2015, has taken the total number of confirmed cases since January 2017 to 14 455. Mr Dick said Queenslanders could still take steps to prevent themselves from getting the flu, including getting the vaccination and staying home from work if they are sick. Health Minister Cameron Dick said it was not too late for people to get the flu vaccination. \"You don't have to go to work if you're sick; you can stay at home and recover from the flu,\" he said. Queensland Health public health executive director Sonya Bennett, from the communicable diseases unit, said the increase in confirmed flu cases showed that there is a \"fair bit\" of influenza circulating in the community. \"It may still rise again the next week or so, as the minister said it's not too late to vaccinate.\" Mr Dick said people with flu symptoms should think about visiting their GP instead of the emergency department. \"If you have a lower level condition, you may have to wait for treatment, because we must give priority to people who require assistance,\" he said. Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital emergency specialist David Rosengren said emergency services were \"well equipped\" to deal with the surge in demand; staff members have also been affected by the winter illness. \"It is certainly very challenging at the moment, when we have a record demand for services,\" Dr Rosengren said. \"Reserve a visit to the emergency department for occasions when it's truly needed.\" The vast majority of this year's 2017 flu cases were influenza A, which Dr Rosengren said was likely behind the heightened demand on emergency services. \"75 per cent of our cases this year 2017 happen to be influenza A, which tends to cause a more significant symptom complex for patients than influenza B,\" he said. Dr Rosengren said it was important for people to minimise their contact with other people if they believed they had the flu. \"If you are unwell ... with symptoms typical of the flu, please be very conscious of the impact of spreading that around the community, and if you're unwell, stay at home,\" he said. Dr Bennett said most people would be able to tell whether they had influenza instead of an ordinary winter cold. \"I think we've all been unwell from time to time and understand when rest ... is the best method,\" she said. \"Or if you're feeling particularly unwell, can't get out of bed, not able to eat and drink effectively, those sorts of signs are the indication that you should go and see your doctor.\" With hundreds of thousands of people expected to attend the Ekka show from Friday 11 Aug 2017, Dr Bennett said the best way to avoid picking up the flu along with a show bag was to be vaccinated. \"Like any mass gathering when it is influenza season and gastro season, the best way to protect yourself is to practice good hygiene, so regular handwashing and vaccination are the best protections against the flu,\" she said. \"I would ask people that are attending any mass gathering to consider those things.\" Byline: Rachel Clun  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\.

Discovery of a highly divergent coronavirus in the Asian house shrew from China illuminates the origin of the alphacoronaviruses. J Virol. 2017. pii: JVI.00764-17.<br><br><strong> abstract available at   Abstract -</strong><br> Although shrews are one of the largest groups of mammals, little is known about their role in the evolution and transmission of viral pathogens, including coronaviruses (CoVs). We captured 266 Asian house shrews (_Suncus murinus_) in Jiangxi and Zhejiang Provinces, China, during 2013 to 2015. CoV RNA was detected in 24 Asian house shrews, with an overall prevalence of 9.02 percent. Complete viral genome sequences were successfully recovered from the RNA-positive samples. The newly discovered shrew CoV fell into 4 lineages reflecting their geographic origins, indicative of largely allopatric evolution. Notably, these viruses were most closely related to alphacoronaviruses but sufficiently divergent that they should be considered a novel member of the genus _Alphacoronavirus_, which we denote W\u00e9nch\u00e9ng shrew virus (WESV). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that WESV was a highly divergent member of the alphacoronaviruses and, more dramatically, that the S gene of WESV fell in a cluster that was genetically distinct from that of known coronaviruses. The divergent position of WESV suggests that coronaviruses have a long association with Asian house shrews. In addition, the genome of WESV contains a distinct NS7 gene that exhibits no sequence similarity to genes of any known viruses. Together, these data suggest that shrews are natural reservoirs for coronaviruses and may have played an important and long-term role in CoV evolution. The origin of alphacoronaviruses had been linked to bats. These data suggest that shrews might have played a role, too. - Mod.PM   .

There are 140 000 chickens on the affected farm in the Paardeberg region, according to the provincial department of agriculture head of communication, Petro van Rhyn. She confirmed that at least 30 000 have died and said the rest would be culled. The virus has not yet been confirmed as the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) type H5N8, which is the strain in outbreaks in other parts of the country. However, the H5 typing, and the nature of its effect on chickens, is indicative of it being the H5N8 strain, according to the department. The poultry industry raised concerns related to the principles and guidelines of compensating affected farms during a meeting with Zokwana last week. The draft guidelines have been completed and are subject to ministerial approval, Molapo said. The approved guidelines will be released by 1 Sep 2017. \"The industry also requested to be given permission to import fertile eggs to close the supply gap as a result of culled birds. \"Only one company has submitted an application for the importation of hatching eggs; the department is still performing the prescribed risk analyses to determine the appropriate level of risk. \"We need to conduct a thorough risk assessment in order to avoid exposing the country to other disease risks,\" Molapo said. There are 2 options which will be presented to the poultry industry - the 1st is for risk mitigation to be conducted in SA through stringent quarantine measures on arrival of the hatching eggs from their country of origin. The 2nd option is for stringent quarantine measures in the country of origin where eggs will come from compartments free of specified diseases that Daff will approve, with less stringent post-arrival quarantine measures. In Heidelberg a Western Cape town, 3 ostrich farms have tested positive for avian flu. No birds have died on the farms but they remain under quarantine. The 2 farms each have about 1000 ostriches. Van Rhyn said no decision to cull ostriches has been taken yet. She also said chicken in stores was safe for consumption. Bronwynne Jooste, spokesperson for Tourism, Economic Development and Agriculture MEC Alan Winde, said culling of the rest of the chickens and composting of mortalities had already been started. Last week, the department's Veterinary Services programme confirmed the disease had spread to the farm. \"The cause is most likely through contact with wild birds. Since then, meetings with poultry veterinarians and stakeholders such as the National Institute for Communicable Diseases have taken place,\" Jooste said. The farm has been placed under quarantine. She said farms within a 3 km approx 1.8 mi zone of an infected farm would be monitored closely and subjected to the control measures as laid out by the national Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (Daff) \"It is strongly recommended that any movement of pet birds, racing pigeons, breeding birds and show birds be limited as far as possible and covered by a movement permit if coming from within 30 km approx 18 mi of an infected farm,\" said Jooste. Sick or dead birds - both wild birds and poultry - must be reported to local state vets, and exports of poultry and poultry products have been suspended except from poultry compartments registered with Daff, or where a country's import permit contains clauses that are able to be signed by a certifying veterinarian. Winde said the virus presented a challenge to control, but the vets were working hard to contain the spread. \"This is a priority for the poultry industry, and the entire agriculture sector. The outbreak and the current drought have made agriculture a tough space to be in. \"This is a particularly difficult time for those affected farms, which are important employers. This is why we ask all stakeholders to continue working with us to mitigate the impact of this outbreak on our economy,\" Winde said. Avian flu is a viral respiratory disease among birds, believed to be transmitted by wild migratory birds. The H5N8 strain of the disease has already wreaked havoc in the poultry industry in Zimbabwe, where thousands of commercial birds have died or had to be culled. Bomikazi Molapo, spokesperson for Daff Minister Senzeni Zokwana, said South Africa had reported 8 further cases of HPAI H5N8 to the World Organisation for Animal Health see comment. This brings the total number of outbreaks to 24 since June this year 2017. \"All affected properties have been placed under quarantine and disease control measures have commenced,\" she said.

Since the start of the HPAI H5N8 epizootic in South Africa, in June 2017, the identified foci have been reported to the OIE in 2 separate threads: one addresses outbreaks involving \"poultry\", which is defined as \"all domesticated birds, including backyard poultry, used for the production of meat or eggs for consumption, for the production of other commercial products, for restocking supplies of game, or for breeding these categories of birds, as well as fighting cocks used for any purpose\". This thread includes, as of today 29 Aug 2017, an accumulated total of 16 outbreaks. The other thread addresses \"non-poultry including wild birds\". \"Non poultry\" are defined as \"Birds that are kept in captivity for any reason other than those reasons referred to in the preceding paragraph, including those that are kept for shows, races, exhibitions, competitions or for breeding or selling these categories of birds as well as pet birds, are not considered to be poultry\".

The recommended measures include screening of air passengers departing from a small number of affected areas on flights to another country. The affected areas, where transmission of the SARS infectious agent is known to be spreading in a human-to-human chain, are kept under constant review and posted each day on the WHO web site. At present, only four countries are concerned. ( see affected areas )  No additional precautions for the screening of departing passengers at airports in any other parts of the world are called for in today\u2019s recommendations.  The screening measures, recommended for consideration by national health officials and port authorities, involve an interview with passengers, departing from a limited number of areas, to detect illness with symptoms that give reason to suspect that a passenger may be infected with SARS.  National authorities may wish to advise travellers with fever, departing on international flights from the few areas where SARS transmission has been documented, to postpone travel until they feel better. All international travellers should be aware of the symptoms of SARS and seek immediate medical attention should symptoms occur. Clinicians hold virtual conference on management of SARS patients  Since global surveillance of SARS began at the end of February, some evidence suggests that a small number of suspected and probable cases of SARS have departed from the small number of affected countries on flights to other countries.  Most cases continue to occur in persons in close face-to-face contact with SARS patients. Close face-to-face contact could conceivably occur in an aircraft among persons seated close to a person infected with SARS and coughing or sneezing.  WHO has also issued detailed recommendations to airlines on steps to take should a suspected case of SARS be detected in flight. The WHO recommendations include advice on step-by-step procedures for following up fellow passengers on the flight who may have had close contact with the possible case and the specific advice that should be given to these travellers and their families.  WHO recommends that contacts of a person be allowed to continue to travel so long as they do not have symptoms compatible with SARS.

Malaria is a life-threatening mosquitoborne blood disease caused by a plasmodium parasite, which is usually transmitted to humans through the bite of the anopheles mosquito. Once an infected mosquito bites a human, the parasites multiply in the host's liver before infecting and destroying red blood cells. According to the senior health official, the country's Epidemic Task Force, headed by the Ministry of Health in partnership with United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and other partners has also stepped up efforts to fight the disease. The health official, however, decried the lack of funds to fight malaria and appealed for donations to help fight the disease. In July 2017, OCHA said more than 76 per cent of disease-related deaths in South Sudan are from malaria. However, the civil war in the country probably means that malaria control activities and probably drug distribution have been impaired, which could be one explanation for the reported outbreak. - Mod.EP   .

Chris Little, who oversaw the research, said, \"We've found that some isolates of the _Fusarium_ species commonly found in soybean seeds are resistant to commonly used fungicides.\" This raises concerns about the role that widespread fungicide seed treatments may play in the development of fungicide resistance. In more than 400 samples from 11 locations, _Fusarium_ species were present in the internal seed tissues of 100 per cent, and some of those strains were capable of causing soybean diseases. Little said, \"It is possible that these fungi, which are present in soil and crop debris, are introduced into the flower and pod during development.\" At least some of the _Fusarium_ species in the seeds proved resistant to common fungicides. Fungicide use has risen dramatically in the past decade, both in foliar applications and seed treatments, which are applied to the majority of all corn and soybean seed planted in the U.S. The fact that fungal pathogens might be present before a treated seed even hits the ground raises the specter of large-scale selection for fungicide resistance. Byline: Emily Unglesbee  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Extensive use of fungicides is generally considered necessary to maintain current conventional high production systems and consequently fungicide resistance has become one of the most important issues in modern agriculture. Different groups of fungicides exist, with each group targeting different sites in the pathogen metabolism. Resistance to one member of a group will usually also confer resistance to other chemicals of the same group. Emergence of resistant strains is encouraged by incorrect applications of the chemicals and use of single compounds. Both facilitate the establishment of pathogen strains with mutations leading to resistance to a respective fungicide, which may occur during the continuous process of pathogen evolution. The report above adds an important consideration to this issue by showing that new resistant strains may not only emerge in the field, but also from seed treatments. To decrease the likelihood of development of fungicide resistant pathogen strains, it is important to apply mixtures of multiple fungicides from different classes. Pathogen strains resistant to such mixtures would require multiple simultaneous mutations conferring separate resistances to the different groups. The likelihood of appropriate mutations occurring simultaneously in a single organism, and thus the emergence of pathogen strains with simultaneous resistance to more than one fungicide class, is considerably smaller than for a single suitable mutation to occur. Another option is the use of crop varieties resistant to a particular pathogen, since resistant varieties do not need to be protected by fungicides. However, to stay ahead of pathogen evolution and be prepared for the emergence of host resistance breaking pathogen strains, ongoing resistance breeding programmes are needed.DHA ", "dates": ["Date: Fri 14 Jul 2017 12:44 PM CDT", "[In] more than 400 samples from 11 locations _Fusarium_ species were"], "title": "Fusarium,\r\n\tsoybean seeds - USA: (KS) fungicide resistant strains "}, "250": {"sentences": "   Thu 20 Jul 2017 Source: 7th Space edited Hong Kong (HKSAR) - The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority: The spokesperson for Hong Kong West Cluster (HKWC) made the following response to a case of Japanese encephalitis (JE) announced by the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today 20 Jul 2017: The male patient has been successively hospitalised in Grantham Hospital (GH) and Queen Mary Hospital (QMH) since 10 May 2017.

A 20 Jul 2017 report in RTHK ( ) indicated that the Centre for Health Protection has reported its 3rd case of Japanese encephalitis this year (2017), in a 52-year-old man, so clearly this is a different one from the case previously posted (Japanese encephalitis - China (HK) http://promedmail.org/post/20170701.5143730). As noted earlier, Hong Kong is entering the JE virus transmission season. There have been sporadic cases of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection in Hong Kong in past years. The virus is endemic in large areas of Asia, including Japan and China. Because Hong Kong is well within the geographic distribution of JEV, it would not be surprising to see additional cases occur occasionally. Individuals living in, or traveling to, JEV endemic areas are well advised to follow precautions to avoid mosquito bites. A JEV vaccine is available in China, but there is a question concerning justification of massive campaigns in Hong Kong where clinical cases are very few. However, it does seem curious that no recommendation is given for vaccination of travelers going to areas of active JE virus transmission outside of Hong Kong. - Mod.TY ", "dates": ["Date: Thu 20 Jul 2017", "today [20 Jul 2017]:", "Hospital (GH) and Queen Mary Hospital (QMH) since [10 May 2017]", "analysis was conducted on [11 Jul 2017] and the diagnosis was", "confirmed today [20 Jul 2017]", "[A 20 Jul 2017 report in RTHK", "case of Japanese encephalitis this year (2017) in a 52-year-old man", "org/post/20170701", "5143730)"], "title": "Japanese encephalitis - China (02): (HK) "}, "255": {"sentences": "<br><br><strong>   Fri 21 Jul 2017 Source: Eurosurveillance edition 2017;22(29) edited Abstract </strong><br> _Hypoderma tarandi_ causes myiasis in reindeer and caribou (_Rangifer tarandus_ spp.) in most northern hemisphere regions where these animals live. We report a series of 39 human myiasis cases caused by _H. tarandi_ in Norway from 2011 to 2016. Thirty-two were residents of Finnmark, the northernmost county of Norway, one a visitor to Finnmark, and 6 lived in other counties of Norway where reindeer live. Clinical manifestations involved migratory dermal swellings of the face and head, enlargement of regional lymph nodes, and periorbital oedema, with or without eosinophilia. Most cases of human myiasis are seen in tropical and subtropical countries, and in tourists returning from such areas. Our findings demonstrate that myiasis caused by _H. tarandi_ is more common than previously thought. Healthcare professionals in regions where there is a likelihood of human infestation with _H. tarandi_ (regions populated by reindeer), or treating returning travellers, should be aware of the condition. All clinicians are advised to obtain a detailed travel history when assessing patients with migratory dermal swellings. On clinical suspicion, ivermectin should be given to prevent larval invasion of the eye (ophthalmomyiasis). Since _H. tarandi_ oviposits on hair, we suggest wearing a hat as a prevention measure.

The 1st 2 cases of cholera were tested positive by National Institute of Health Islamabad on Mon 31 Jul 2017 and another 2 confirmed positive for the infection on Fri 4 Aug 2017. All the 4 patients were undergoing treatment at Benazir Bhutto Hospital BH where as many as 4 more suspects of the infection have been admitted for treatment. Data collected by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017 reveals that the allied hospitals have sent stool samples of over 10 child patients to NIH for confirmation of cholera in last week week of Sun 6 Aug 2017. On Sat 12 Aug 2017, as many as 20 child patients with severe diarrhoea were admitted at the BBH of which 4 were suspected as patients of cholera and their stool samples were sent to NIH for confirmation, said Associate Professor of Paediatrics at Rawalpindi Medical University Dr Tariq Saeed when contacted by 'The News' on Mon 14 Aug 2017. He added the hospital has not received confirmation reports from the NIH because of holidays there from Saturday to Monday. However, we have been keeping the suspects in isolation under strict monitoring, he said. He added that repeated rainfalls in the region and water inundation inside and outside homes in a number of localities particularly in thickly populated areas of the city are causing contamination of water and foodstuff that increases chances of spread of a number of infections among population while children are at greater risk of contracting life-threatening infections including cholera. It is important that the transmission of cholera occurs primarily by drinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the feces (waste product) of an infected person, including one with no apparent symptoms. It is observed that heavy rainfall causes collection of heavily contaminated water in streets and houses and the waste water flooding out of various nullahs watercourses including Nullah Leh in town causes infections including cholera, typhoid, dysentery, gastroenteritis, hepatitis A and E, shigellosis and giardiasis. Professor Tariq said the consumption of contaminated water and foodstuff causes cholera, an infection in the small intestine caused by bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. Its main symptoms are watery diarrhea and vomiting that can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, and death in cases which are not treated in time, he said. Health experts say that to avoid cholera and other infections, one must use boiled water for drinking and should use vegetables after washing with clean water and it must be kept in mind that raw vegetables should not be eaten in the existing weather conditions instead these should be used after cooking. To a query, Professor Tariq said the heavy rainfall and water accumulation may contaminate water at sources and there may be chances of contamination of water at tube wells so individuals must boil water before drinking to avoid cholera and other infections. He added the appearance of cholera is alarming and it is time for people to take extra ordinary preventive measures to safeguard their children and themselves from the disease. In case water is accumulated inside home due to heavy rainfall and flooded out of sewage lines, it must be wiped out immediately and the space should be washed with clean water as soon as possible to avoid infections. Avoiding inundation of contaminated water inside homes is a must to avoid cholera and other infections, said Professor Tariq.

NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80 percent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:  - Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_; - Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65 percent (95 percent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam;  - Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however, have suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be effective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and outbreak situations (63, 64).<br><br><strong> \"References </strong><br> 57.

DN, of Greene Township, who leases over 460 acres 186 ha of property for farming and hunting, is worried about what could happen to the local deer population if nothing is done, and whether cattle and horses she owns could become infected: \"And it's a very important source of meat for a lot of families.\" Matt Kramer, a wildlife conservation officer with the Pennsylvania Game Commission, said it's unusual for the disease to turn up in the same area again and again, especially since EHD typically doesn't occur in Pennsylvania. \"The midge fly bites an infected animal, gets in the blood, transmits it to another unaffected animal who then contracts the disease, and then it goes to these areas to die,\" he said. \"So it's cyclical, because if the midge fly bites the deer and then bites multiple deer and infects them, it creates a situation where you're just infecting more and more deer in a particular area.\" They haven't been able to pinpoint an exact reason for it, but he said it could be environmental. \"There's no proof of anything. It just seems to be that's where they're showing up. Now is it because people keep looking for them there 1st? We don't know,\" he said. \"Having gone through that in the past 10 years, the residents in those particular areas know what they're looking for, so they call us and say, you know, we have these suspected dying deer.\" When the disease 1st occurred 10 years ago, he estimated that hundreds of deer in the area died from it. A smaller population was infected in 2012. The midge flies that spread the disease typically live near water. Other dead deer have been found in the area, but those animals couldn't be tested for the disease because a viable sample has to be dead for less than 10 hours, Kramer said. While humans cannot contract the disease, other animals can get it, such as other hooved creatures like cattle. EHD in livestock or any animals besides deer has not been reported. \"It's primarily in the southern states,\" Kramer said. \"The deer in that particular area usually build up antibodies. Some of them are resistant do it. We just don't have it frequently enough here for the deer to build up a resistance. So when we get it, the deer get hit hard.\" As for DN and KN, they've begun to grow frustrated that nothing has been done over the years. DN would like for someone to spray the area to kill the midge flies, but Kramer said the area is too large to be sprayed and the disease will \"have to run its course.\" \"You can't get anybody to help us. That's the problem. That's what we're upset about,\" DN said. \"Nobody will help us. They just let it go. And they wait for the frost, and the frost kills it off. The acute, infectious disease is usually characterized by extensive hemorrhages. EHD is NOT the same as bluetongue disease. Although presentation may be similar, these diseases are antigenically very different. The article from Pennsylvania seems a sad commentary on where we put funds. We seem to take no consideration to the people who watch these animals. It seems to come down to a case of no or little research being invested in this disease, or perhaps many diseases of wild deer and perhaps farmed cervids as well. Research is expensive but some of our resource may depend upon finding cures. If you have ever been bitten by one of the midge fly, it can be painful. - Mod. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ ", "dates": ["Date: Mon 31 Jul 2017 1:51 PM EDT", "Date: Mon 31 Jul 2017", "last week [week of 24 Jul 2017] it was reminiscent of a disease that", " In 2007 and 2012 dead deer in the Hookstown", "DN of Greene Township who leases over 460 acres [186 ha] of property"], "title": "Epizootic hemorrhagic disease - USA (04) (KY,\r\n\tPA): cervid "}, "86": {"sentences": "   Mon 21 Aug 2017 12:56 pm EDT Source: The Packer edited The United States' Food and Drug Administration's 2-year sampling program for sprouts has produced both enforcement actions  prompting 6 product recalls and helping stop an outbreak of listeriosis  and long-term insights on the prevalence of pathogens on sprout seeds and finished product. The FDA's \"fiscal year 2014-16 microbiological sampling assignment summary report: sprouts\" collected and tested sprouts as part of a \"proactive and preventive approach\" to help protect food safety, according to the report. Samples were tested for salmonella, _Listeria monocytogenes_, and _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7. Collecting 825 samples of domestic product, virtually all fresh sprouts eaten in the United States are grown in the USA, the sampling program tested sprout seeds, fresh sprouts, and spent irrigation water, according to the summary. FDA's sprout sampling program found: - salmonella was found in 0.21 per cent of the sprouts, 2.35 per cent of seeds and 0.54 per cent of used irrigation water; - _L. monocytogenes_ was in 1.28 per cent of the tested sprouts, similar to the percentage found in seeds and used irrigation water; - no sprouts/spent irrigation water tested positive for _E. coli_ O157:H7. Seeds weren't tested for that strain due to limitations associated with the test method; - samples with pathogens were from a small number of companies, with positives at 8 (8.5 per cent) of the 94 sprouting operations tested; According to the summary, many firms still have progress to make in sprout safety. \"The fact that the agency found multiple positive samples at some of these operations underscores the need for sprouting operations to comply with the agency's Produce Safety Regulation (published November 2015), which seeks to prevent outbreaks of foodborne illness and improve sprout safety,\" according to the report. During the testing process, the FDA worked with firms that owned or released the sprouts/seeds to conduct recalls or to have the product destroyed, and then followed up with inspections. The sampling program helped stop a listeriosis outbreak before it spread beyond a few cases, and it also prompted 6 recalls. While no large-scale testing of sprouts is planned, the FDA will determine if more sampling is needed. Criteria include whether a firm has a history of uncorrected contamination and observations from food safety inspectors who visit the facilities, according to the report. \"The presence of harmful bacteria in the commodity remains a concern to the agency in view of the history of reported outbreaks associated with sprouts, including 5 in 2016, and the fact that this assignment resulted in 6 product recalls,\" it said. byline: Tom Karst  communicated by: ProMED-mail The report \"FY 2014-2016 microbiological sampling assignment summary report: sprouts\" from the FDA's Office of Compliance, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition can be found at  .<br><br><strong> \"Executive summary </strong><br> \"The FDA set out to collect and test sprouts in 2014 as part of a new proactive and preventive approach to deploying its sampling resources with the ultimate goal of keeping contaminated food from reaching consumers. \"The new approach, detailed in the Background section of this report (page 4 available at the URL above), centers on the testing of a statistically determined number of samples of targeted foods over a relatively short period of time, 12 to 18 months, to ensure a statistically valid amount of data is available for decision making. This approach helps the agency determine if there are common factors  such as origin, season, or variety  associated with pathogen findings. \"The FDA issued the sprouts assignment in January 2014 under its new sampling model. The assignment targeted sprouts at 3 points in the production process (seeds, finished product, and spent irrigation water), with the aim of collecting and testing 1600 samples to determine the prevalence of select pathogens in the commodity. As background, the FDA designed its sampling plan such that if contamination of one per cent or greater was present in the commodity, the agency would detect it. The FDA monitored the assignment closely to gather lessons learned and make changes to its sampling procedures if needed to address trends or food safety issues. About one year into the assignment, the FDA decided to stop its collection and testing at 825 samples because it had already collected samples on more than one occasion from many of the sprouting operations known to the agency and its state partners. The sample set acquired was sufficient for the FDA to estimate the bacterial prevalences in the commodity with a 95 percent confidence interval of 0 per cent to 2 per cent for a one percent contamination rate. \"The FDA tested only domestically grown sprouts for this assignment because virtually all sprouts eaten in the United States are grown domestically due to the commodity's delicate nature and relatively short shelf-life. Of note, the industry features a preponderance of relatively small operations. \"The FDA tested the sprout samples for 3 pathogens: salmonella, _Listeria monocytogenes_, and _E. coli_ O157:H7. Based on the test results, the FDA found the prevalence of salmonella in the finished product sprouts to be 0.21 per cent. The agency also found that the prevalence of salmonella in seeds (2.35 per cent) was significantly higher than in finished product (0.21 per cent) and in spent irrigation water (0.54 per cent). Based on the test results, the FDA found the prevalence of _L. monocytogenes_ in the finished product to be 1.28 per cent. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of _L. monocytogenes_ based on point in the production process. None of the samples tested positive for _E. coli_ O157:H7. The agency did not test seed for _E. coli_ O157:H7 due to limitations associated with the test method. \"Among the FDA's other findings, the agency found most of the positive samples at a small number of sprouting operations. Specifically, the FDA found violative samples at eight (8.5 per cent) of the 94 sprouting operations visited for purposes of this assignment. The fact that the agency found multiple positive samples at some of these operations underscores the need for sprouting operations to comply with the agency's Produce Safety Regulation (published November 2015), which seeks to prevent outbreaks of foodborne illness and improve sprout safety. \"To address the positive samples, the FDA worked with the firms that owned or released the affected product to conduct voluntary recalls or to have their consignees destroy it, and then followed up with inspections. Of particular note, this sampling assignment helped detect and stop an outbreak of listeriosis while it still entailed a small number of cases, as described in the public health Impact section of this report (page 14 available at the URL above). This assignment also prompted 6 product recalls. \"The FDA will continue to consider microbial contamination of sprouts and how best to reduce it. Such contamination remains a concern to the FDA given the aforementioned outbreak and the recalls initiated. Going forward, the FDA intends to inspect sprouting operations to ensure they are complying, as applicable, with the Produce Safety Rule, which includes new requirements for sprouts growers. The agency has no plans to conduct additional large-scale sampling of sprouts at this time but may sample the commodity in accordance with its longstanding approach to food sampling, which centers on (but is not limited to) the following criteria: - a firm has a previous history of unmitigated microbial contamination in the environment (such as, human illness, recalled or seized product, previous inspectional history, or environmental pathogens without proper corrective actions by the facility), or - inspectional observations that warrant collection of samples for microbiological analyses.\" - Mod.LL   .

Narrating specifically about Punjab, the highest populated with relatively better infrastructure, the mosquito control measures were first strengthened following 2009-10 multi-district fatal outbreaks of dengue hemorrhagic fever. Special surveillance for _Aedes_ larvae is being conducted on largest scale in Punjab. House-to-house surveying for indoor and outdoor larvae detection has yielded substantial biological evidence over last 6-7 years with resultant seasonal pattern identification. Legislation and law enforcement regarding epidemic prevention and control has also yielded good results. This active surveillance has contributed much toward control of _Aedes_ mosquito and hence the dengue virus and chikungunya virus transmission, despite highest mass transit from all endemic and outbreak foci. In Punjab, only 3 cases of chikungunya have been confirmed in 2017. These are not epi-linked and sporadic in occurrence over wide geographical area. 2 of these have traveled with infection from Sindh Province. 1 case has acquired infection in Punjab. Larvae detection is always high in the monsoon season. Surveillance activities in the field are android enabled and transformed onto an electronic dashboard for daily progress monitoring of real time geo-tagging of detected larvae. Hence, it can be projected that Punjab is least likely to be involved in any bigger outbreaks of chikungunya virus with such strict control measures. If control measures are haltered, the vector is present and may start transmitting viruses at a greater pace.  <br><br>Communicated by: EpiCore Surveillance Project member Dr Sarmad W Siddiqui Fellow FELTP-Pakistan ProMED-mail thanks Dr Gaines and Dr Siddiqui for their insightful comments and hopes that public health and vector control authorities in Pakistan will be able to deliberate further on this matter and incorporate similar larvicidal agents in their control strategies, if they are not being used currently.

The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services NH DHHS said it is the 1st human case of Jamestown Canyon virus JCV in the state in 2017. It is the state's 3rd case of the virus found in a human. The 1st case was in May 2013 and the 2nd was in November 2015. \"Jamestown Canyon Virus is one of several viral infections that can be transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito in New Hampshire,\" said State Epidemiologist Dr. Benjamin Chan. \"It is an uncommon infection to be found, but similar to West Nile Virus WNV and Eastern Equine Encephalitis EEE, it also has the potential to cause serious health complications, including central nervous system infection. Because of the risk for various infections from mosquitoes, we want to remind people to take steps to avoid mosquito bites and remove areas of standing water around their homes where mosquitoes might breed and reproduce.\" JCV primary is found in deer and a variety of mosquito species in North America. Since 2000, more than 50 human cases of JCV have been identified nationally. A man in Maine tested positive for the virus in July 2017. JCV usually is asymptomatic but it can result in a mild fever or more serious central nervous system complications, including meningitis and encephalitis, according to NH DHHS. There is no specific treatment. DHHS said the best way to prevent infection from JCV and other mosquito-borne illnesses like WNV and EEE is to prevent mosquito bites. The occurrence of JCV in New Hampshire is not surprising. As noted in the above report, a case occurred earlier this year (2017) in the neighboring state of Maine. As noted in previous ProMED-mail posts, JCV was 1st isolated from a pool of 9 _Culiseta inornata_ mosquitoes captured in Jamestown Canyon, Colorado, in 1961 and later shown to be widely distributed in eastern and midwestern USA. Boreal northern _Aedes_ and _Ochlerotatus_ mosquitoes are the primary vectors. As with the other California serogroup Orthobunyaviruses, transovarial virus transmission is common, with newly emerging female mosquitoes already infected with the virus in the spring and ready to transmit the virus. White-tailed deer, _Odocoileus virginianus_ are the principal amplification hosts. As Drs Charles Calisher and Paul Grimstad pointed out in ProMED-mail archive no. http://promedmail.org/post/20040807.2171, JCV frequently seems to be forgotten as an etiological agent of human disease, and provided the following references: 1.

Zika virus (or Zika) has been reported in Dominica. Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in Dominica are infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:  Women who are pregnant:  Do not travel to Dominica.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to Dominica or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers considering pregnancy:  Before you or your partner travel, talk to your health care provider about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection.  Wait before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.  If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex &ndash; or do not have sex &ndash; for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex, or do not have sex, for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy  Talk to your health care provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you&rsquo;re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Wait at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  Men are advised to wait longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.gov  Contact CDC  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  1600 Clifton Road  Atlanta ,  GA  30329-4027  USA  800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)  Contact CDC-INFO  TOP", "dates": [" Page created: March 22 2016", " Page last updated: August 08 2017", " Page last reviewed: August 08 2017", " 30329-4027", " 800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)"], "title": ["Zika Virus in Dominica"]}, "454": {"sentences": "<br><br><strong>   Thu 10 Aug 2017 Source: Eurosurveillance Volume 22, Issue 32 edited Reoccurrence of botulinum neurotoxin subtype A3 inducing foodborne botulism, Slovakia, 2015 -</strong><br> The life-threatening illness botulism is caused by 7 serotypes (A-G) of botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT), however only serotypes A, B, E and F cause disease in humans. BoNTs prevent neurotransmitter release and lead to a flaccid paralysis. There are 3 main forms of human botulism: food-borne, wound and infant botulism 1,2. The BoNTs are produced by 6 phylogenetically and physiologically distinct bacteria (_Clostridium botulinum_ Groups I-IV, and strains of _C. baratii_ and _C. butyricum_) which are so diverse as to merit classification as different species. All of the BoNT-producing _Clostridium_ species have non BoNT-producing counterparts (not harboring the BoNT gene cluster) which are often assigned to different species names, such as _C. sporogenes_ for _C. botulinum_ Group I strains 2. This polyphyly of _C. botulinum_ together with its close relationship to non-toxigenic species can result either in the erroneous detection of toxigenic _Clostridium_ species or failure thereof. The BoNT gene cluster is often associated with mobile genetic elements, allowing for interconversion between toxigenic and nontoxigenic _Clostridium_ species, and leading to substantial variation in BoNT sequences and their genomic backgrounds 3. Today, the BoNT serotypes are divided into more than 40 subtypes, including BoNT/A1 to BoNT/A8 4, and mosaic forms 5. The BoNT diversity at the amino acid level can reach up to 36 percent within a serotype and is reflected by differences in their catalytic activity, receptor binding or pharmacokinetics 6. In addition to containing the gene for BoNT, the BoNT gene cluster contains the gene for the non-toxic non-haemagglutinin (NTNH) protein. The BoNT gene cluster also harbors either 3 hemagglutinin (HA) genes (ha1, ha2 and ha3) in the HA cluster or 3 orfX genes (orfX1, orfX2 and orfX3) in the orfX cluster. Together with BoNT, these accessory proteins can form complexes of varying size and composition 7. The variability observed in BoNTs due to the existence of 7 serotypes, mosaic forms, several different subtypes and the occurrence of BoNT in different complexes, as well as their heterogeneous genetic background are probably the main reasons for the spectrum of clinical presentations and disease duration associated with botulism, and pose a tremendous challenge to diagnostic laboratories 8. Botulism is associated with a wide variety of foods that are rich in protein and kept under the partial exclusion of oxygen, or in an environment where oxygen has been depleted by other bacteria. Marinated meat, fish, fruits, vegetables or mushrooms as well as home-canned products and home-cured or smoked meat or fish products, which are consumed unheated, are particularly known sources. BoNTs are heat-labile and can be destroyed by temperatures above 70\u2009C 158 F in minutes 9,10. Nowadays, foodborne botulism is almost exclusively associated with home-produced foods, but commercial food products are occasionally involved in single cases or small outbreaks 11-13. Between 2010-2014, ECDC reported 492 cases in Europe 14, with the last case occurring in Slovakia in 2012 15.<br><br><strong> The event -</strong><br> In mid-August 2015 (day 0), an otherwise healthy adult in their 40s consumed, for dinner, 3 packs (100 g each) 3.52 ounces of a commercial hummus spread. The hummus, which was sold in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, had a best-before date of 9 days after consumption. The following morning (day 1), 9-11 hours after consumption of the hummus, the patient experienced nausea, vomiting, double vision, unsteady gait, dizziness, generalized weakness and difficulties swallowing, and was admitted to hospital. Despite receiving 3 doses of equine trivalent anti-A, B and E antitoxin, the patient felt into a coma on day 2 and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). As botulism is a mandatory notifiable disease in Slovakia, the clinic reported the suspected botulism case to local health authorities. A gastric lavage, but neither serum nor stool, was taken on day 2 and stored at 4 C 39.2 F for further analysis. After one week of storage, the gastric lavage was sent to the Public Health Institute in Ostrava, Czech Republic where it tested negative by mouse bioassay. Treatment consisted mainly of intensive symptomatic care and respiratory support for almost 50 days. The patient was discharged from hospital after 78 days, but still complained about breathing problems as of their last follow-up in May 2017.<br><br><strong> Methods: Epidemiological investigation -</strong><br> On day one, after being notified by the clinic, the regional health authorities started an epidemiological investigation by interviewing the hospitalized patient. The next day, day 2, the patient's household was inspected to check for additional cases and to collect food samples. There, a close relative who shares the same household was interviewed, a list of food items consumed by the patient over the last days was recorded and suspicious food items were collected. In cooperation with the Slovak State Veterinary and Food Administration (SVPS), an investigation on the composition and the origin of the ingredients used for production of the hummus was conducted at the food processing facility.<br><br><strong> Laboratory investigation </strong><br> Isolation of _Clostridium botulinum_ from hummus and molecular analysis. Small particles of hummus left on the packaging of the 3 nearly empty hummus tubes were streaked on tryptic soy agar and Schaedler agar plates, and subjected to anaerobic culture at 37\u2009C 98.6 F in anaerobic jars following EN ISO 7937:2005. Almost all colonies showed typical clostridia-like morphology and were probed for the presence of bont genes with a multiplex PCR for bont/A, bont/B, bont/E and bont/F 16 according to CEN ISO/TS 17919:2013. Genetic analysis Isolates were transferred to the Consultant laboratory for neurotoxin-producing clostridia (botulism, tetanus), formerly called the Consultant Laboratory for _Clostridium botulinum_, at the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) in Berlin, Germany for further molecular biological investigation. Isolates were grown in tryptone-peptone-glucose-yeast extract (TPGY) medium at 32\u2009C 89.6 F in an anaerobic workstation (MG500, Don Whitley, Shipley, United Kingdom), and tested for the presence of bont/A-G by single and multiplex quantitative PCR 17. In addition, a quantitative PCR was used to test for the ntnh gene as a surrogate marker for BoNT-producing _Clostridium spp._ 18. To further investigate the composition of the BoNT gene cluster, a set of 6 conventional PCRs targeting the 3 ha genes and the 3 orfX genes was applied 19. Toxin production in supernatants was confirmed by in-house ELISA tests as described 20,21. The 16S rRNA and bont/A gene sequences were obtained by Sanger sequencing 22. Sequences were assembled and compared with the GenBank database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information in the United States via Geneious software packages (Biomatters Limited, Auckland, New Zealand) using the BLAST algorithm 23. For subtyping, the amino acid sequence of the BoNT was compared with the 8 known BoNT/A subtypes 4. Sequences of the other BoNT/A subtypes were uploaded into Geneious and pairwise identities of the aligned sequences were calculated using the MAFFT algorithm 24. For comparison, the BoNT subtypes of the following BoNT strains causing food-borne botulism in the past (except for BoNT/A4 which originated from an infant botulism case) were selected (GenBank accession numbers in parenthesis): BoNT/A1 (HA cluster) strain ATCC3502 (AM412317); BoNT/A1 (orfX cluster) strain NCTC2916 (X52066); BoNT/A2 (orfX cluster) strain Mascarpone (DQ310546); BoNT/A3 (orfX cluster) strain Loch Maree (CP000963); BoNT/A4 (orfX cluster) strain 657 (EU341307); BoNT/A5 (HA cluster) strain 1430.11 (KC683799); BoNT/A6 (orfX cluster) strain CDC41370 (FJ981696); BoNT/A7 (unknown cluster) strain 2008-148 (JQ954969); BoNT/A8 (orfX cluster) strain Chemnitz (KM233166). Further microbiological investigation In order to identify additional possibly contaminated products of the same production date, the Regional Authority of Public Health (RAPH) in Banska Bystrica investigated the products' availability at several local supermarkets and the food bank. While no additional hummus was available from the food bank, 3 tubes of hummus with the same production date as the ones consumed were obtained from a supermarket. Unopened products were stored at 37\u2009C 98.6 F for several days to reach suitable conditions for _C. botulinum_/_C. sporogenes_ germination and growth.<br><br><strong> Results -</strong><br> Epidemiological investigation: Results from the interview revealed that on day 0, the patient alone ate scrambled eggs for breakfast; the patient, a close relative and a friend shared the same meal of mushrooms in cream sauce with pasta for lunch; and the patient alone ate the hummus at dinner after obtaining it from a food bank. The interview of the patient and a close relative revealed that one tube of the hummus product showed gas production prior to being opened, but it tasted normal according to the patient. The epidemiologists notified the Regional Veterinary and Food Administration of the Slovak Republic and the 3 nearly empty tubes of hummus and 2 unopened packs of a commercial ready-to-eat sauerkraut and vegetarian sausage meal, from the same company as the hummus, were sent for laboratory investigation. Neither the scrambled eggs nor the pasta dish were available for sampling. An investigation at the producing company revealed that the hummus product consisted of the following ingredients: chick peas, tofu, rapeseed oil, onion, salt, maize starch and spices. It also revealed that the chick peas originated from Brazil or Argentina. Laboratory investigation: RAPH received the collected food items, including the 3 opened and nearly empty 100 g 3.52 ounces hummus tubes. Three strains with typical _C. botulinum_ morphology (designated Banska Bystrica, RAPH1223j and RAPH1224) were isolated, one from each tube. Two of them, Banska Bystrica and RAPH1223j, were PCR-positive for the bont/A gene. The vegetarian sausage and sauerkraut meal tested negative for the presence of _C. botulinum_ and the bont/A gene. On day 7, as soon as the 1st results were available, the hummus was withdrawn from the market and a Food and Feed Safety Alert was issued through the European Commission's Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF). The 3 unopened hummus tubes with the same production date that were obtained from a supermarket were subjected to 37\u2009C 98.6 F storage. Microbiological analysis and PCR testing did not reveal the presence of _C. botulinum_ or _C. sporogenes_ despite some signs of gas formation during storage. Molecular biological characterisation of isolated strains: The sequences of the 16S rRNA gene analysed at RKI revealed that all 3 isolates (strains Banska Bystrica, RAPH1223j and RAPH1224) belonged to _C. botulinum_ Group I/_C. sporogenes_ (greater than\u200999 percent identity), which are almost indistinguishable at the 16S rRNA sequence level 2,25. The presence of bont/A and ntnh genes was confirmed by quantitative PCR, and expression of the toxin was shown by an in-house ELISA for isolates Banska Bystrica and RAPH1223j. From the 2 BoNT/A-positive isolates, the BoNT/A sequences were obtained and compared with GenBank entries at the nucleotide (nt) and the amino acid level. Both toxigenic isolates (Banska Bystrica and RAPH1223j) were found to harbor a bont/A gene of identical sequence; the bont/A sequence of one strain, Banska Bystrica, was submitted to GenBank under accession number KU376389. It showed the highest identity (greater than or equal to\u200999.6 percent) to bont/A sequences of the unusual subtype BoNT/A3. Table one shows the distances computed against all BoNT/A subtypes at the nt and the amino acid levels for Table, see original URL - Mod.LL. Compared with the prototype BoNT/A1, the BoNT of the new BoNT/A-positive isolates, Banska Bystrica and RAPH1223j, had an identity at the amino acid level of only 84.6 percent (compared with BoNT/A1 strain ATCC3502; HA cluster) or 84.5 percent (compared with BoNT/A1 strain NCTC2916; orfX cluster). Similar low amino acid level identities (between 84.3 percent and 87.7 percent) were found when compared with BoNT subtypes A4-A8, whereas amino acid level identity with subtype A2 (strain Mascarpone) was 92.9 percent. Sequence identities at the nt level were generally higher, but still diverged by up to 8.5 percent. Both isolates (Banska Bystrica and RAPH1223j) were negative for the ha1, ha2 and ha3 genes and positive for the orfX1, orfX2 and orfX3 genes by PCR; this is in agreement with the BoNT/A3 strain Loch Maree in which the bont/A gene is located in the orfX cluster.<br><br><strong> Discussion </strong><br> Our laboratory investigations support the diagnosis of a case of foodborne botulism caused by the unusual BoNT subtype A3 in food consumed by the patient. To our knowledge, this is only the 2nd time that this subtype was involved in foodborne botulism since 8 people died from contaminated wild duck paste in Loch Maree, Scotland in 1922 26. No other strain belonging to this specific A3 subtype was isolated or subtyped for nearly a century until Luquez and colleagues identified 3 strains from Argentina (in soil and salad) in 2012 27. Interestingly, the 2 described BoNT/A-positive isolates have an identical BoNT/A sequence at the amino acid level as one of the strains (CDC54054) isolated from Argentinian soil 27, and the chick peas used in the hummus consumed by the patient originated from South America, either from Brazil or Argentina. Initially, suspected botulism could not be confirmed by testing the gastric lavage taken on day 2. Considering the acidity and proteolytic activity, as well as the length of storage, the gastric lavage taken after emesis on day one was not an ideal sample. Serum and stool samples, which have been proposed to be the most reliable samples for diagnostic testing 28, might not have been collected, because of a lack of testing facilities and inexperienced clinical personnel, particularly since botulism is a rare disease and no cases have been notified in Slovakia since 2012 15. For the clinician, it is important to consider the optimal timing when choosing samples for botulism diagnosis. Despite demonstration of BoNT in serum as one of the key tests to confirm botulism, the time period in which BoNT can be detected from serum is usually limited to the 1st few days after oral ingestion. However, confirmation of BoNT-producing _Clostridium_ species (spores) from feces can often be achieved over a more prolonged period (up to two weeks) 28,29. Therefore, co-examination of serum and stool is recommended to confirm clinical cases of food-borne botulism 28-31. The mere detection of _C. botulinum_ from feces without clinical symptoms does not imply the presence of botulism given that _C. botulinum spores_ are not usually detected in the feces of healthy humans. However, on rare occasions, spores that have been ingested with naturally contaminated food (e.g. honey, fresh vegetables) might be detected in the feces of otherwise healthy people 28. In our case, foodborne botulism could only be confirmed by the isolation of _C. botulinum_ from 2 of the 3 consumed tubes of hummus. It is always hard to exclude that the analyzed food become cross-contaminated in the household with _C. botulinum_ by handling with kitchen utensils contaminated via another food. However, there was no indication that the hummus became cross-contaminated within the patient's household. In the aftermath of the current botulism case, 3 unopened hummus tubes with the same production date were subjected to 37\u2009C 98.6 F storage and analyzed for the presence of _C. botulinum_ without any positive result. It is not unusual that _C. botulinum_ cannot be detected from other items of the same lot. In 3 botulism outbreaks in Europe in 2011, which involved commercial olive tapenade, almond-stuffed olives and korma sauce, _C. botulinum_ and BoNT could only be identified from one or 2 opened jars/pots obtained from the households, but not from any unopened jars/pots from the same lot (consisting of 60, 900, and 1836 items, respectively) that were tested 11,32-34. These cases indicate that even in modern industrialized food production, contamination of a single or a very few items within a lot cannot be completely excluded. In all those cases, consumer protection had utmost priority and food recalls were issued solely on the basis of positive results from the remaining product in the open containers from the affected households to prevent a potential spread of the disease 32-34. Hummus has been involved in a foodborne botulism outbreak in the past, possibly due to incorrect storage temperature 35 C 95 F. Whether this was the case in the event presented here could not be determined, but the patient did notice gas formation in the products. This might be indicative of spoilage as growth of _C. botulinum_ in spoiled products is often associated with gas production, e.g. foaming, bulging of cans 36. However, unlike Group II strains of _C. botulinum_ which can grow at refrigeration temperatures, Group I strains (to which this study's isolated strains belong) require growth temperatures above 10\u2009C 50 F 2. This suggests that the hummus product was at least partially stored above refrigeration temperatures. Compared with the known 8 BoNT/A subtypes (BoNT/A1 to BoNT/A8 4), the subtype A3 is both very rare and the most distant from the prototype BoNT/A1 (Table 1), being up to 15.4 percent and 8 percent different at the amino acid and nt level, respectively. Notably, because of its amino acid sequence divergence, BoNT/A3 is known to be neutralized less efficiently by polyclonal antibodies generated against BoNT/A1 37. This has led us to speculate that the long lasting neurological effects observed in the patient despite the administration of 3 doses of trivalent antitoxin might at least be partially due to suboptimal neutralization by the antitoxin, which is directed against BoNT/A1. The rareness and divergence of the BoNT/A3 subtype poses the risk that it might not be detected by immunological or sequence-based diagnostic assays that have not been validated against it. In fact, one ELISA has already been shown to be unable to detect it 38. Furthermore, in one 39 of the 4 mentioned PCR methods in ISO ISO/TS 17919:2013, the sequence of one primer and the probe each contain one mismatch towards all BoNT/A3 sequences. These mismatches might therefore hamper identification of strains belonging to the A3 subtype by the corresponding PCR 40,41. Testing laboratories should be aware that strains harboring this rare subtype can occur in European countries and are advised to validate their methods accordingly. Unfortunately, the exchange of BoNT-producing strains and in some instances, even the sharing of their sequence information are restricted because of their nature as possible biowarfare agents and other dual-use concerns 42,43.<br><br><strong> Conclusion </strong><br> Rare and novel BoNT sequence variation can especially easily escape detection by sequence-based or immunological methods. As more sequences become available despite some restrictions, diagnostic facilities should check their PCRs frequently to ensure inclusion of all known sequence variations. As a result of the rareness of botulism, many laboratories have no or only individual assays for detection at hand. Specialized laboratories (e.g. national reference laboratories or consultant laboratories) able to apply a broader range of methods could aid those laboratories, but are often not easily identifiable by the laboratories responsible for testing the samples.

LL) is a major cause of serious human gastrointestinal illness and have the potential to cause life-threatening complications, such as hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) (1). An average of 0.4 cases of EHEC illness per 100 000 persons per year are reported to public health authorities in Australia (2). Disease severity can range from asymptomatic infection to serious and sometimes fatal illness, particularly in young children and the elderly (3,4). Healthy ruminants, particularly cattle, are the reservoir for EHEC (5). Human infection with EHEC usually occurs as a result of inadvertent ingestion of fecal matter after consumption of contaminated food, water, or unpasteurized milk; contact with animals or their environments; or secondarily, through contact with infected humans (4,5). In the largest previously reported outbreak of EHEC illness in Australia in 1995, which was associated with consumption of mettwurst (uncooked, semidry, fermented sausages), HUS developed in 23 of the 51 case-patients identified, and there was 1 death (6).<br><br><strong> The Study -</strong><br> A multidisciplinary incident management team was established to investigate an outbreak of EHEC illness associated with an annual agricultural show in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, in August 2013. The incident management team defined primary and secondary outbreak cases. Persons with laboratory-confirmed EHEC infection associated with the outbreak and their household contacts were followed up until the point of microbiological evidence of clearance, which was defined as 2 consecutive negative stool samples collected more than 24h apart (7). Case-patients and contacts with a high risk for transmission (persons under 5 years of age; persons unable to maintain good hygiene; or childcare, healthcare, aged care, or food preparation workers) were advised to avoid childcare and work settings in accordance with Queensland Health Guidelines (7). Enhanced surveillance measures were implemented to assist with case finding. Medical practitioners were requested to avoid use of antimicrobial drugs for suspected case-patients with EHEC infections because of previously reported associations between antimicrobial drug use and HUS. We developed a case-control study to obtain additional information related to animal contact, hand hygiene, and food consumption at the agricultural show. We analyzed data by using Epi Info 7 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA). EHEC identified from human, environmental, and animal samples were serotyped for O and H antigens. Expression of Shiga toxin 1 (stx1) and stx2 genes was determined for selected isolates. Shiga toxin gene subtyping and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis was performed. During 21 Aug 2013 to 27 Sep 2013, we identified 57 outbreak-associated laboratory-confirmed case-patients with EHEC infection: 54 confirmed primary case-patients, 1 probable primary case-patient, and 2 secondary case-patients (Figure 1 for figures, see original URL - Mod. LL). Of the 57 cases-patients, 32 (56 percent) were female. Case-patients ranged in age from 1 to 77 (median 9) years; 31 (56 percent) case-patients were 3.

The total death toll is in the dozens, as the flock that made it to Israel numbered over 120. Bringing the sheep from Canada to Israel took diplomatic negotiations between the countries as Israel generally does not allow importation of livestock due to concerns over viruses, including bluetongue virus. All of the \"Jacob's sheep\" breed were given a clean bill of health before leaving Canada on an USD 80 000 airlift operation and underwent a stormy quarantine upon arriving in Israel. JL says the couple is \"devastated\" by the deaths. \"It hit every single sheep, but half of them were able to survive,\" she says. \"It has been hard because we love every sheep.\" The couple hoped to start an educational farm to celebrate the Jacob's sheep breed, whose origins can be genetically traced back to the Middle East some 5000 years ago. The sheep are characterized by \"spots and speckles,\" the kind of sheep that Jacob took from Laban in Chapter 30 of the book of Genesis. Byline: Melanie Lidman  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. The Canadian Jacob's sheep consignment arrived in Israel several months ago. Their holding is located at Nes Harim, less than 10 km 6. For media coverage of said import, please refer to  . The serotype of the bluetongue virus involved is not given; serotyping results are anticipated. During 2016's disease season, bluetongue was widely spread in several parts of Israel, affecting sheep and cattle. According to Israel's official report to the OIE, a total of 29 outbreaks were recorded, most of them caused by BTV serotype 8; others were caused by serotypes 1, 2, 3, and 15. Their details were as follows: August (6 outbreaks, all serotype 8); September (12, of which 11 st 8, 1 st 3); October (4, of which 3 st 8, 1 st 3); November (7, of which 4 st 8, 1 st 15, 2 st 2). An inactivated BTV vaccine, serotype 8, is currently available for voluntary vaccination of susceptible animals. This sad event is reminiscent of a past major event in Israel, when European sheep of a highly susceptible breed (German mutton merino) were exposed to BTV-4, following their importation from northern Germany. The highest losses were encountered in the Taanach area (Valley of Yezreel), where  in 7 villages with 134 small flocks of the said breed (totaling 2260 breeding ewes and 1332 lambs), a morbidity rate of 39.5 percent and case-fatality rate of 45.6 percent were recorded. Since July 1964, when the event above occurred, BT has been identified and reported in Israel each year, presenting a clear seasonal pattern, with most cases recorded between July to December, peaking October/November. Single exceptional cases have been recorded, throughout the years, in January and June. Susceptible sheep breeds were successfully protected, until recently, by annual pre-seasonal vaccinations with multivalent live-attenuated vaccines. Since 2009, BT has become a disease affecting cattle as well in Israel. Details on the vaccination history of the imported Jacob's sheep will be helpful. Subscribers interested in the genetic background of the Jacob's sheep breed, are referred to ref 1, from which the following excerpt is copied: \"Our study also provides genetic evidence supporting the anecdotal origin of some less common sheep breeds. For example, one of the 10 populations analysed from the British Isles, the Jacob sheep, displayed a homogenous R2 retrotype very different from the other British populations and more similar to the South-Western Asiatic and African breeds. The origins of the Jacob are unknown. This breed owes its name to the Biblical story of Jacob who took \"every speckled and spotted sheep\" as a wage from his father in law Laban (Genesis 30:25-43; probably the 1st recorded use of selective breeding in livestock). Our retrotype analysis supports a direct link between the Jacob sheep and breeds in South-West Asia or Africa rather than other British breeds.<br><br><strong>\" Reference -</strong><br> Chessa B, Pereira F, Arnaud F, et al.

Zika virus (or Zika) has been reported in Aruba. Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in Aruba are infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:  Women who are pregnant:  Do not travel to Aruba.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to Aruba or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers considering pregnancy:  Before you or your partner travel, talk to your health care provider about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection.  Wait before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.  If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex &ndash; or do not have sex &ndash; for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex, or do not have sex, for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy  Talk to your health care provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you&rsquo;re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Wait at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  Men are advised to wait longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.gov  Contact CDC  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  1600 Clifton Road  Atlanta ,  GA  30329-4027  USA  800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)  Contact CDC-INFO  TOP", "dates": [" Page created: February 18 2016", " Page last updated: August 08 2017", " Page last reviewed: August 08 2017", " 30329-4027", " 800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)"], "title": ["Zika Virus in Aruba"]}, "154": {"sentences": " Magill Partners GeoSentinel Global TravEpiNet Mobile Apps RSS Feeds  Nontuberculous Mycobacteria in Medical Tourists to the Dominican Republic  Recommend on Facebook  Tweet  Share Compartir  Warning - Level 3, Avoid Nonessential Travel  Alert - Level 2, Practice Enhanced Precautions  Watch - Level 1, Practice Usual Precautions  What is the current situation?  Serious infections with bacteria&mdash;called nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM)&mdash;recently have been reported in US residents who had cosmetic surgery in the Dominican Republic. Most, but not all, of these people had surgery at the Centro Internacional de Cirugia Plastica Avanzada (CIPLA clinic) in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Problems after surgery have included infections of the surgical wound and deep abscesses. Symptoms of surgical wound infections can include pain, redness, tenderness, swelling, feeling warm to touch around the area of the surgery, or drainage of fluid or pus from the wound. Other symptoms of infection may include fever, chills, muscle aches, and a general feeling of illness. Symptoms are most likely to develop within 1 month of surgery.  NTM infections can get into the body during surgery from the environment (air, water, or surfaces) or in medications or materials used during or after surgery, such as surgical instruments or dressings. This can result in dangerous infections and lengthy treatment, sometimes requiring additional surgery.  If you are planning to travel abroad for medical care:  CDC recommends that people do not have surgical procedures at the CIPLA clinic.  Be aware that all medical and surgical procedures carry some risk, and complications from surgery can happen anywhere.  You should see a travel medicine specialist in the United States 4&ndash;6 weeks before your trip for advice and any vaccines or medicines you may need for travel.  Make sure you&rsquo;re healthy enough to get medical care abroad. If you have any health conditions, ask your doctor if it&rsquo;s okay for you to travel and have medical or surgical procedures done while you are abroad.  Research the health care provider who will perform your procedure, as well as the clinic or hospital. Be aware that standards for providers and clinics may be different from those in the United States.  Some clinics and hospitals are accredited by international organizations, but using a facility that is accredited does not guarantee you won&rsquo;t have any complications.  Ask the clinic for a copy of all of your medical records from procedures performed abroad, in English if possible. Bring them with you to any follow-up appointments in the United States.  Anytime you travel outside the country, there are health and safety concerns to consider at your destination. You also should consider the additional risk of travel associated with surgery:  Flying and surgery raise the risk of blood clots , so flying soon after surgery is really risky. You should not travel for 10 days after chest or abdominal (belly) surgery. If you&rsquo;ve had cosmetic procedures on the face or have had laser treatments, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons says you should wait 7&ndash;10 days before flying.  You should consider the risks of typical vacation activities such as sunbathing, drinking alcohol, swimming, taking long tours, or doing any strenuous activities or exercise after surgery.  If you think you have an infection or other complication:  You should seek medical care right away, regardless of where you received care, and tell your health care provider about your travel and any medical care or surgery you had abroad.  Traveler Information  Medical Tourism  The International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery guidelines for travelers  Aerospace Medical Association medical guidelines for airline passengers with certain medical conditions  Clinician Information  Clinicians should consider nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infections in the differential diagnosis for all people who have wound infections after surgery abroad, including surgery that has occurred weeks to months previously.  Consider NTM infection in patients who have surgical site infections unresponsive to standard treatment.  NTM are commonly antimicrobial drug resistant and difficult to treat. These infections may require protracted and complex antibacterial drug combinations and courses, which may benefit from consultation with an infectious disease specialist. Surgical interventions are frequently necessary adjuncts to antibacterial drug therapy.  Although NTM grow well on routine bacterial culture media, clinical specimens frequently fail to exhibit growth after empiric use of common antibacterial drug therapy, particularly when swab specimens are collected instead of body fluids or tissue. Some patients with these infections may have acid fast&ndash;positive smears or tissue preparation but no organism recovered on culture.  To minimize diagnostic delays, especially when encountering surgical site infections among medical tourists, clinicians should consider NTM infection, collect adequate specimens, and communicate this suspicion to ensure correct laboratory testing is performed.

Most of the problems were linked to planting, germination, and general production. One of the farmers said the potatoes will begin to grow well and bring out fresh leaves, but after a while, the leaves will wither and that affects the potatoes in the ground. Dr Tony Onoja, Agricultural Policy Research Network (APRNet), said that their problem might have emanated from a viral disease. He said some diseases are airborne, thereby affecting many farms. Floods also transfer the organism. Dr Onoja advised the farmers to consult experts to scientifically verify the cause of the problem and thereafter proffer the necessary solution. Potato has become the most cultivated crop in Plateau State. Byline: Dickson S Adama  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. A considerable number of potato diseases due to fungi and other pathogens are known to occur in the region. In particular, late blight (PLB; caused by the fungus-like organism _Phytophthora infestans_) was reported from Nigeria's Plateau State previously (ProMED-mail post http://promedmail.org/post/20140611.2533396). While the symptoms described above may be consistent with PLB, the advice given to farmers to seek a scientific diagnosis is utterly sound. Reliable diagnosis is essential before effective management strategies can be designed for the affected areas. Late blight of potato (and tomato) can cause 100 per cent crop losses. It is considered an increasing problem worldwide, with more virulent strains emerging frequently. Farm saved seed tubers have often been reported as sources of PLB outbreaks.

Four horses were unvaccinated and one horse had unknown vaccination status. A total of 4 horses died or were euthanized and one horse is recovering.\" West Nile is transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs for WNV include flulike signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed; fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculation; hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound); changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they are daydreaming or \"just not with it\"; occasional somnolence (drowsiness); propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control); and \"spinal\" signs, including asymmetrical weakness. Some horses show asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia. Equine mortality rate can be as high as 30-40 percent. Horse owners should also consult their private practicing veterinarian to determine an appropriate disease prevention plan for their horses. Vaccines have proven to be a very effective prevention tool. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot; in areas with a prolonged mosquito season, veterinarians might recommend 2 boosters annually  one in the spring and another in the fall. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3- to 6-week period. In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and applying mosquito repellents approved for equine use. By Erica Larson  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. The watch word of the season for horses is vaccinate, vaccinate, vaccinate.

Corr.SB, edited For the 1st time since 1998, a case of yellow fever has been confirmed in Guiana. It is a woman who stayed in the forest towards Saint-\u00c9lie and Oiapoque, in the border area with Brazil. The Institute Pasteur of Guiana yesterday Mon 21 Aug 2017 confirmed yellow fever virus infection in Guiana, for the 1st time since 1998. The infected person died on 9 Aug 2017. She could have been infected in the border area of Oiapoque in Brazil, according to the initial investigations of the ARS (Agence Regional de Sant\u00e9; regional health agency). She had been in the forest near St Elie and in the Oyapock Valley. The mosquito control department of the CTG Collectivit\u00e9 Territoriale de Guyane  official name of French Guiana began its mosquito control operations around the identified places of transit of the deceased patient: the Cayenne hospital centre, the Kourou medical and surgical centre; the surrounding forest of Saint-\u00c9lie; degradation of Petit Saut; the lower Oyapock. The ARS recommends that unvaccinated people who present with symptoms and who have visited the area since 15 Aug 2017 should consult their doctor without delay. Unvaccinated people can be vaccinated at most general practitioners and at the following centres: - CPS of the Red Cross, - traveller centre or CDPS of the Centre Hospitalier de Cayenne, - PMI centers of the CTG. The ARS reminds all that vaccination is the main prevention measure against yellow fever.<br><br><strong> Transmission to humans, symptoms and treatments: </strong><br> Yellow fever is an acute viral disease transmissible from animal (monkey) to man and man to man by various mosquitoes (genus _Aedes_, but also other genera circulating in the forest). The yellow fever virus is transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito. After an incubation period of about one week, the disease is characterized by fever, chills, muscle pain, headache, nausea, vomiting. Severe forms (hemorrhage, liver disorders, kidney problems) can develop in 15 per cent of cases. Vaccination is the main prevention measure against yellow fever. The vaccine is safe, and very effective, a single dose is usually enough to give lasting immunity and lifetime protection against the disease. In 30 days, it gives an effective immune protection to 99 per cent of vaccinated subjects. In case of yellow fever, symptomatic treatment may be proposed (rehydration, antipyretic medicines to limit fever, vomiting and pain, antibiotics for superinfections). However, French Guiana is endemic for YF and the area where the woman was infected is forested and is likely to have foci of sylvan (forest) YF. Yellow fever was detected in 1951 in French Guiana and YF immunization has been compulsory there since 1967. In the year 2000, a cluster survey showed that immunization coverage in the population was estimated at 80-90 per cent, depending on the age category  . The last case of autochthonous YF notified in Guiana before the one cited above occurred in 1998 in a town on the border with Surinam.

It was also the county's 7th confirmed case of rabies this year 2017. It saw the same number of cases through the entirety of 2016, officials said. According to information released by Gwinnett county spokeswoman Heather Sawyer, the unidentified woman was at a repair shop on Cripple Creek Drive on Sat 10 Jun 2017 when she was bitten on the toe by a young fox. The fox then tried to attack other customers but was killed by bystanders. Tissue from the fox later tested positive for rabies. Other rabid foxes were reported in the Lawrenceville area on 18, 30, and 31 May 2017. In the 30 May 2017 case, a woman was attacked before fending the fox off with a QuikTrip cup. \"Animal welfare and enforcement officials advise there are numerous fox dens in the area of the Sat 10 Jun 2017 incident and urge people to use caution if they are approached by animals acting strangely,\" a county news release said. Previous rabies cases in Gwinnett included a 15 May 2017 incident involving a cat and 2 separate March incidents involving raccoons. The county had 7 confirmed rabies cases in all of 2016, 4 in 2015, and 12 in 2014, officials said.

With the exception of one, none of these articles emphasize pet vaccinations or the importance of providing rabies clinics to try and reach other people and to make the community aware of a deadly disease. Building a barrier between yourself and this disease is through vaccinating your pets. Certainly one of these articles explores a controversial issue of when is an animal protected from the virus after receiving a vaccine. According to CDC 28 days is required to reach maximum titers. This is not a forum to debate the trap, neuter, vaccine, release programs nor is it a forum to challenge the 28 days stated by CDC, although there may be more recent research papers that could challenge the time limit and certainly some animals may reach peak titers sooner or later.

A few points... 1. Do we know what strain(s) of meningococcal disease the Taiwan cases had? Were they all the same? If the organisms are distinguishable, we would not consider this an outbreak but, rather, a cluster. 2. Much of the evidence on which chemoprophylaxis policies are based is now rather old. At the time, it was far more common for students to live in \"dormitories\", with 2 or more students sharing a bedroom. Now  at least in the UK  this is extremely unusual: most student accommodation has only one student (or couple) per bedroom - no sharing with a relative stranger. A high proportion even have en-suite bathroom facilities. Is that the same in USA? Perhaps the Taiwanese military provides less comfortable lodgings! 3. What is the basis for the moderator's comment that \"The choice of vaccine will depend on knowing the serogroup of the outbreak strain, because the quadrivalent (ACYW) meningococcal vaccine will cover serogroups A, C, Y, and W, and the serogroup B vaccine will cover only serogroup B, without cross-coverage.\" I'm particularly interested in the comment that the \"serogroup B vaccine will only cover...\". Since the so-called serogroup B vaccines do not use the polysaccharide capsule ABCWY antigens, but rather antigens from different part of the organism, they are independent of the ABCWY antigens, and the group B vaccines can be expected to be effective against meningococci independent of the ABCWY classification. 4. Experience with these new so-called serogroup B vaccines remains limited. At present we do not have evidence to clarify the extent of \"herd immunity\" they will provide, but we have some evidence to suggest that they prevent disease (invasion), but not colonization (infection), and are therefore unlikely to have a significant effect on herd immunity. 5. The rationale for chemoprophylaxis based on the hypothesis that a more-than-usually virulent strain has evolved, with the argument going as follows: a. Meningococcal carriage is common - in some studies, over a 3rd of 1rst-year university students will be carrying the organism after 2-3 months at university (a combination of the carriage rates in this age-group, and the social-mixing effect of starting at university, presumably). b. People who become ill with invasive meningococcal disease almost invariably get sick within 5 days of acquiring the organism. If somebody has been colonized for 7 days or more, they are extremely unlikely to get sick with it. c. Some strains  like the C strain that caused outbreaks in teenagers in the UK in the 90s  are considerably more virulent, with very little asymptomatic carriage. (The virulence genes are unrelated to the capsular phenotype, and capsular switching, maintaining the same virulence factors, is possible and appears to have happened with the increase in W serogroup disease in the UK, for example.1) d. For the less virulent strains at least... e. When somebody becomes ill, it could be because of individual factors (the case was unusually susceptible  for underlying reasons, such as inherited complement deficiencies, or because of an unfortunate timing eg recent viral infection); or because of pathogen associated factors  the organism had evolved to become more than usually virulent. f. Given the high carriage rates, there's little point in chemoprophylaxis for normally virulent organisms. g. So chemoprophylaxis is based on the hypothesis that the case may have acquired their infection from a healthy carrier of a more virulent organism. The purpose is to eliminate carriage of this organism. The contacts targeted are therefore those from whom the case is most likely to have acquired their infection. (There is very little evidence of benefit for treating other people exposed to the case.) h. There is also a hypothesis  supported, I believe, by some evidence  that healthy carriers of meningococci and related organisms (such as _N. lactamica_) can benefit from \"competitive inhibition\". This means that the presence of the organism they are carrying reduces their chances of acquiring a new, potentially more virulent strain - see b. above. i. For this reason, extending chemoprophylaxis to people other than those from whom the case acquired their infection might do more harm than good (by increasing people's susceptibility to new infections). 1.

In regard to the activity of meningococcal serogroup B vaccines against non-serogroup B disease, since the surface protein antigens in the serogroup B meningococcal vaccines may also be present and expressed in meningococci belonging to non-B serogroups, there may be the potential for serogroup B vaccines to offer a some level of protection against non-B serogroups. Protection against invasive meningococcal disease is conferred mainly by complement-mediated antibody-dependent killing of _Neisseria meningitidis_. Studies that tested in an in vitro bactericidal assay against serogroup C, W and Y meningococci using sera collected in the UK, Germany, France and Brazil from individuals immunized with one of the B serogroup vaccines found that sera from was bactericidal \"in a range from 45 per cent to 90 per cent\" ( ), the preliminary data having been presented in poster sessions. However, on the basis of what we know for sure at present, \"experts from the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\" ( ), say that meningococcal polysaccharide and conjugate vaccines \"provide no protection against serogroup B disease, and meningococcal serogroup B vaccines (MenB) provide no protection against serogroup A, C, W, or Y disease. For protection against all 5 serogroups of meningococcus, it is necessary to receive MenACWY or MPSV4 and MenB.\" And the CDC's recommendations ( ) clearly state, \"Serogroup B meningococcal (MenB) vaccines can help prevent meningococcal disease caused by serogroup B. Other meningococcal vaccines are recommended to help protect against serogroups A, C, W, and Y.\" In regard to antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis, its rationale for close contacts of cases of meningococcal disease is based on the high attack rate of secondary meningococcal disease among these contacts, which has been estimated to be 500-800 times greater than for the general population ( ). Because the attack rate for close contacts is highest during the 1st few days after onset of disease in the primary patient, antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis should be administered as soon as possible. - Mod.ML ", "dates": ["Date: Wed 2 Aug 2017", "England July 2015 to January 2016", " Euro Surveill 2016;21(12):3 DOI:", "2807/1560-7917", "30175", "org/post/20170801", "5218924", "has been estimated to be 500-800 times greater than for the general"], "title": "Meningitis, meningococcal - Taiwan (02): fatal, military base,\r\n\tcomment "}, "25": {"sentences": "   Wed 16 Aug 2017 4:01 EDT Source: Oakland Press edited The Oakland County Health Division says 63 cases of hepatitis A have been confirmed over the past year, that's 58 more than the previous year 2016.

It can grow to more than one meter (3.3 ft) in length. This species used to be widespread in central, south western, and southern China, but it is considered to be critically endangered. It has declined catastrophically over the last 30 years, principally due to over-exploitation, and it is now very rare, with few surviving populations known. Commercial over-exploitation for human consumption is the main threat to this species. It has also suffered from habitat destruction (such as from the construction of dams) and habitat degradation (such as water pollution from mines). For a picture go to  . In 2010, an outbreak of disease occurred amongst farmed Chinese giant salamanders in Shanxi Province, China. Clinical signs included anorexia, lethargy, ecchymosis, and swollen areas on the head and limbs and skin ulceration. An investigation was carried out and they isolated for the 1st time a ranavirus infection associated with mass mortality in Chinese giant salamanders. This virus was named Chinese giant salamander virus (CGSV-L). This virus has not been studied in the wild. It might be possible that it circulates causing little impact, but under the stressing circumstances that might arise in captivity the virulence increases. - Mod.PMB   .

This makes access to health information both more equitable - and effective.  Multilingual communication bridges gaps and fosters understanding between people. It allows WHO to more effectively guide public health practices, reach out to international audiences, and achieve better health outcomes worldwide. In this way, multilingual communication is an essential tool for improving global health:  \"A multilingual WHO is better equipped to communicate health messages, to produce and disseminate health information and to generate, share and use knowledge about health in an equitable manner. It is also better placed to meet today's major public health challenge: strengthening health systems in order to provide essential health care for all.\"  Multilingualism: plan of action pdf 39.7kb  Six official languages  WHO's six official languages - Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish - were established by a 1978 World Health Assembly resolution, turning multilingualism into a WHO policy. Since the adoption of a 1998 resolution, all Governing bodies documents and corporate materials have been made available online in all official languages.  Many of WHO's key scientific publications - like the International Classification of Diseases, World Health Statistics, and the World Health Report - appear in six languages, and often many more.  The World Health Assembly's most recent resolution on multilingualism, adopted in 2008, repeats the call for linguistic diversity across the Organization, and a five-year plan of action (2008-2013) is underway to meet this challenge.  Multilingualism: implementation of the plan of action pdf, 13kb  WHO's multilingual web site  WHO's multilingual web site was launched in January 2005 in the six official languages. Web site content is carefully selected, edited, adapted and tailored to meet the needs of different readers and linguistic groups.  While all essential content is available in the six official languages, technical content - with the intention of rationalizing the use of resources - is deliberately published only in some languages. Decisions on what content to publish in which language(s) are made based on an analysis of the target audience needs, and in response to emergency situations and crises.  WHO's multilingual web site is growing significantly; it is becoming the leading online global public health reference, connecting readers - in their own languages - to high quality health information.  Partnering for multilingualism  While WHO gives priority to its official languages, it recognizes that the world's people live and work in many more. In order to broaden its reach to these audiences, WHO licenses external entities to translate and publish its health information in other languages.  WHO is always seeking opportunities to expand its multilingual information, and external publishers are key partners in this process. Health ministries, NGOs, universities and commercial publishing houses regularly request the rights to publish multilingual versions of WHO publications. As a result of these partnerships, WHO publications have been translated and published in over 63 different languages.

The patient was of Cambodian origin but lived in Germany for over 30 years. He reported having returned on Sun 23 Jul 2017 from a 4-month visit to Cambodia (Province Kompot) where he had visited his family. After his return, malaria has been ruled out by negative thick and thin smear in a secondary care hospital in the region of Unterfranken, Bavaria, Germany, to which he was previously admitted. On the day of transfer a blood culture became positive with _Burkholderia spp_. and was confirmed by PCR as _Burkholderia pseudomallei_. The isolate is susceptible to the cephalosporins, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones and tetracycline. A CT scan showed multiple lung abscesses on both sides and pleural effusion with one abscess fistulating into the mediastinum. The patient had no breathing difficulties in and no abscess sites on the skin or any other organ involvement and was immediately put on IV-antibacterials (1g meropenem 3 times a day and 500mg levofloxacin 2 times a day). He currently is in stable condition and became afebrile within 2 days of treatment. Apart from recently diagnosed diabetes he had no other underlying conditions.  Christian Kleine MD Prof. August Stich MD, DTM&H Medical Mission Hospital Teaching Hospital of the University of Wuerzburg Wuerzburg Germany ProMED thanks Drs Kleine and Stich for this first hand contribution. Melioidosis is a disease of the rainy season in its endemic areas. It mainly affects people who have direct contact with soil and water. Many have an underlying predisposing condition such as diabetes (commonest risk factor), renal disease, cirrhosis, thalassemia, alcohol dependence, immunosuppressive therapy, chronic obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and excess kava consumption. Kava is an herbal member of the pepper family that can be associated with chronic liver disease. Melioidosis may present at any age, but peaks in the 4th and 5th decades of life, affecting men more than women. In addition, although severe fulminating infection can and does occur in healthy individuals, severe disease and fatalities are much less common in those without risk factors. The most commonly recognized presentation of melioidosis is pneumonia, associated with high fever, significant muscle aches, chest pain, and  although the cough can be nonproductive  respiratory secretions can be purulent, significant in quantity, and associated with on-and-off bright, red blood. The lung infection can be rapidly fatal  with bacteremia and shock  or somewhat more indolent. Acute melioidosis septicemia is the most severe complication of the infection. It presents as a typical sepsis syndrome with hypotension, high cardiac output, and low systemic vascular resistance. In many cases, a primary focus in the soft tissues or lung can be found. The syndrome, usually in patients with risk factor comorbidities, is characteristically associated with multiple abscesses involving the cutaneous tissues, the lung, the liver, and spleen, and a very high mortality rate of 80 to 95 percent. With prompt optimal therapy, the case fatality rate can be decreased to 40 to 50 percent. The melioidosis bacillus is intrinsically insensitive to many antimicrobials. It should be noted that bioterrorism strains may be engineered to be even more resistant. _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ is usually inhibited by tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT), antipseudomonal penicillins, carbapenems, ceftazidime, and amoxicillin/clavulanate or ampicillin/sulbactam. Ceftriaxone and cefotaxime have good in vitro activity but poor efficacy; and cefepime did not appear, as well, to be equivalent to ceftazidime in a mouse model. The unusual antimicrobial profile of resistance to colistin and polymyxin B and the aminoglycosides but sensitivity to amoxicillin/clavulanate is a useful tool to consider in treatment of infection with the organism. The randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing melioidosis treatment have been reviewed, and it was found that the formerly standard therapy of chloramphenicol, doxycycline, and SXT combination had a higher mortality rate than therapy with ceftazidime, imipenem/cilastatin, or amoxicillin/clavulanate (or ampicillin/sulbactam).

Cases of vaccine-derived polio have been reported in Syria, according to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. Most cases have been reported in Mayadeen District, in Dayr az Zawr Province.  Vaccine-derived polio can occur in places with low vaccination rates and poor sanitation where oral polio vaccine is used. Oral polio vaccine contains a live, weakened version of the virus. In such circumstances, this weakened virus can circulate for an extended period of time and change into a form that can cause paralysis. This form of the vaccine is not used in the United States and most other developed countries.  CDC recommends that all travelers to Syria be fully vaccinated against polio. In addition, adults who have been fully vaccinated should receive a single lifetime booster dose of polio vaccine.  What is polio?  Polio is a disease caused by a virus that affects the nervous system. It is spread by person-to-person contact, mainly through exposure to the feces of an infected person. You could also get polio by drinking water or other drinks or eating raw or undercooked food that has been contaminated by the feces of an infected person.  Most people with polio do not feel sick. Some people have only minor symptoms, such as fever, tiredness, nausea, headache, nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, stiffness in the neck and back, and pain in the arms and legs. Most people recover completely. In rare cases, polio infection causes permanent loss of muscle function in the arms or legs (usually the legs); if there is loss of function of the muscles used for breathing or an infection of the brain, death can occur.  What can travelers do to prevent polio?  Get the polio vaccine:  Ask your doctor or nurse to find out if you are up to date with your polio vaccination and whether you need a booster dose before traveling. Even if you were vaccinated as a child or have been sick with polio before, you may need a booster dose to make sure that you are protected. See individual destination pages for vaccine recommendation information.  Make sure children are vaccinated.  See the Polio Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) for more information.  Eat foods and drink beverages that are considered safe: Follow the Food and Water Safety tips to avoid eating or drinking things that could be contaminated with polio virus.  Practice hygiene and cleanliness :  Wash your hands often.  If soap and water aren&rsquo;t available, clean your hands with hand sanitizer (containing at least 60% alcohol).  Don&rsquo;t touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. If you need to touch your face, make sure your hands are clean.  Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.  Try to avoid close contact, such as kissing, hugging, or sharing eating utensils or cups, with people who are sick.  Traveler Information  CDC Polio Homepage  Polio Vaccine Information Statement (VIS)  Food and Water Safety  Clinician Information  All travelers to any country should be up to date on routine vaccinations, including polio vaccine. CDC recommends a single lifetime IPV booster dose for travelers to certain countries.

Shipped from Amsterdam to Miami after participating in Sweden and UK An American dressage horse returning to the United States after a competition tour in Europe could be euthanized or shipped back out of the country after testing positive for glanders during routine USDA equine import quarantine. Glanders is a highly contagious upper respiratory disease that can be passed from horse-to-horse as well as to human handlers. Acute clinical signs include fever; cough; difficulty breathing; nasal discharge; swollen and painful submaxillary lymph nodes (the \"glands\" in \"glanders\"); rapidly spreading ulcers on the nasal mucosa, nodules, and chronic abscesses; and small abscesses in the lung and/or abscesses in the liver or spleen, among others. Clinical signs of chronic glanders include coughing; malaise; weight loss; intermittent fever; possible thick nasal discharge, usually out of one nostril; ulcers and nodules on the nasal mucosa; enlarged submaxillary lymph nodes; chronic enlargement and induration (hardening) of lymphatics and lymph nodes; joint swelling and painful leg edema (fluid swelling); and nodules, particularly on the legs, that rupture, release pus, and ulcerate. Glanders has been eradicated from North American and was last reported in the United States in the 1940s. It's recently been reported in several areas around the world, however, including South America, Eastern Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and a rare case in Germany in 2014. Earlier this month August 2017, the 18-year-old Dutch Warmblood gelding Sagacious HF was shipped from Amsterdam to the Miami International Airport after participating in competitions in Sweden and England with Chase Hickok. Under USDA rules, all horses entering the United States, except those coming from Canada, must be quarantined and tested for 4 diseases  dourine, glanders, equine piroplasmosis, and equine infectious anemia  upon arrival. Jeanine Neskey, interim public affairs specialist for the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), said an animal that produces a positive test result is denied entry to the United States. \"Denied entry means that it must be either removed from the U.S. or be euthanized,\" she said. \"If the horse is denied entry into the U.S. (and not euthanized), the owner is free to take the horse to any other country that will accept it.\" Scott Leibsle, DVM, Idaho's deputy state veterinarian, said Sagacious could have contracted the disease through contaminated feed or through water buckets also used by other horses participating in competitions. The gelding might also have been an asymptomatic carrier of the disease, possibly developing signs after experiencing stress \"Transport is the most stressful thing you can do to a horse,\" he said. \"At the same time, you're putting it with new animals in a new area, and putting it under the stress of competition.\" Currently APHIS uses a complement fixation test (CFT) to detect glanders. However, the agency is evaluating other testing methods, including the Western Blot procedure. \"Advancing research and improved technology continue to develop new or improved testing methods for animal diseases,\" Neskey said. \"USDA routinely evaluates all testing methods available and incorporates the methods most appropriate to the needs of import quarantine testing.\" After Sagacious produced a 2nd positive CFT glanders test, he produced a negative Western Blot glanders test. Arrangements were made to place him on extended quarantine pending the results of additional testing with both tests, slated for Wed 23 Aug 2017. Byline: Pat Raia  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail Glanders, also known as farcy, is a contagious infectious disease of equines, acute or chronic, usually fatal, caused by the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_, and characterized by the development of ulcerated nodules that are most commonly found in the upper airway, lungs ,and skin. Felines and other animals are susceptible to infection, which is usually fatal. Humans can be infected and the microorganism (_B. mallei_) is considered a potential bioterrorism agent. The disease, one among the oldest known and that used to be prevalent worldwide, is currently eradicated or effectively controlled in many countries. Recently the disease has been reported in some countries, including Iraq, Turkey, Pakistan, India, Mongolia, China, Brazil, United Arab Emirates, and countries in Africa. Glanders is one of the diseases contained in the list of diseases for mandatory reporting to the World Animal Health Organization (OIE). The bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_ a clonal pathogen, can be found in nasal secretions and skin ulcers of infected animals. The transmission of glanders occurs commonly from intake of water or food contaminated with nasal secretions and exudates eliminated from infected animals, contact with contaminated equipment (saddles, harness) and by eating contaminated equine meat. In the nasal form, nodules arise in septum and turbinates. Nodules progress to irregular edged ulcers; star-shaped scars are characteristic after the resolution of the ulcers. In the early stage, submandibular lymph nodes are enlarged and edematous, adhering to the skin and deep tissues in advanced stages of the disease. In the pulmonary form, inflammatory nodules with caseous or calcified centers are found in the lungs. With the progression of the disease areas of consolidation and pneumonia may be present. The nodules may break and eliminate the inflammatory content into the bronchial tree, spreading the infection to the upper respiratory tract. In the cutaneous form, nodules arise along the lymphatic vessels, especially on the extremities. The nodules may degenerate to form ulcers with drainage of highly infectious purulent material. The liver and spleen may have typical nodular lesions. Histologically, vasculitis, thrombosis, inflammatory cell infiltration and degeneration can be seen. A test based on complement fixation can also be used for screening, but the ELISA test, although more sensitive, is not being routinely used. PCR can be used for specific identification ( ). There are no vaccines. Prevention and control depend on early detection and eliminating infected animals in addition to quarantine and complete disinfection. Treatment, administered only in endemic areas, which does not lead to microbiological cure, is the use of doxycycline, ceftazidime, gentamycin, or streptomycin. Sulfa drugs (including in combination with trimethoprim) seem to be effective in prevention and glanders treatment ( ). For glanders-free countries, there are OIE recommendations on importing equines. An international veterinary certificate is required attesting that the animals showed no clinical signs of glanders and were kept in an exporting country free of the disease for at least 6 months prior to shipment ( ). It appears foreign horse owners will not be able to comply, therefore will be unable to repatriate their show horses? Further information would be welcome. As a horse owner, this would be devastating. We certainly hope Sagacious test later this month August 2017 clears him of this disease. - Mod.TG   .

County authorities closed off the gated community's Main Beach, also known as Commodore Park, last Fri 28 Jul 2017, a day after receiving reports of potential _E. coli_ infection in people who had visited the area. Additional beaches were closed after _E. coli_ bacteria were confirmed present Tue 1 Aug 2017 in shallow water at 3 of the 5 Lake Wildwood beaches tested: Meadow Park, Hideaway Park, and Commodore Park. All children known by the county to be infected played on the latter, the Nevada County Public Health Department said. The beaches will remain off-limits until bacteria levels subside, and the county Public Health Department has warned all lake-goers to stay out of the water. As of Wed 2 Aug 2017, the county has reported that one adult and 9 children have become ill in connection with the man-made lake. 6 of the children have been hospitalized, 2 of whom were later discharged. Recovery time for an _E. coli_ infection, which can cause symptoms ranging from cramps to often-bloody diarrhea to nausea, is typically 5 to 10 days, according to WebMD, an online health site. Three of the children have developed a serious condition called hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) that can result in kidney failure. While most people who contract HUS recover, according the county's public health department, the condition can be fatal. No updates on the children's conditions were available Thu 3 Aug 2017, said county public health coordinator Patti Carter. County officials are still trying to determine the cause of the lake's contamination, she said, and will continue to test water for bacteria twice a week at 7 locations along the 5 beaches already checked. Nevada County's Public Works Department found no leaks from nearby sewer lines. Amy Irani, the county's environmental health director, said the county is examining creeks flowing into the lake, feces from deer, geese, or turkeys, and contamination from humans as possible sources of the bacteria. No reopening date for the beaches has been set. \"Unfortunately, this is a natural bathing area, and unlike a swimming pool, chemicals cannot be added to remedy the _E. coli_ bacteria,\" Irani wrote by email. \"Time is what is needed, and thus the closures will remain in effect until further notice.\" A public pool at Lake Wildwood remains open as it has not been linked to _E. coli_. In addition to closing beaches, the county's Environmental Health Department and the Lake Wildwood Association have posted signs cautioning about _E. coli_ risk. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ This apparently waterborne outbreak of presumed EHEC (enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_; the serotype has not yet been reported) is now up to 10 cases with 3 of these developing hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). HUS generally occurs in 10 per cent or less of EHEC infections so more cases may well have occurred and are not yet reported. Also, since EHEC can have an incubation period up to 12-14 days, more cases may well occur. Although EHEC is most often associated with undercooked ground beef or other contaminated food, the disease can also be transmitted when people drink, or swim in, tainted water. The primary carriers are cattle but can be deer, sheep, goats, and other livestock, wild animals or humans. In the spring of 2000, in Walkerton, a town of 5000 in southern Ontario, an outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infection claimed 7 lives  6 adults and a child  and over 200 were seen at local area hospitals.

The invasive Asiatic mosquitoes can carry dengue fever and the chikungunya virus, and attack in daylight. Experts from Public Health England destroyed the batch of mosquito eggs and larvae at the busy Ashford International truck stop earlier this month August 2017. This is the 2nd time that one of the planet's most dangerous insects  so-named because of its striped body and legs  has been discovered entering into the UK during the last year. Asian tiger mosquitoes  scientific name, _Aedes albopictus_  have been spreading across Europe and are blamed for up to a million global cases of chikungunya globally every year. The disease has no cure and leaves victims in a fever and with excruciating joint pains as well as headaches, nausea and rashes. There is a death risk of one in a thousand cases. France confirmed 4 cases in 2014 and there was an epidemic in Italy a decade ago. Asian tiger mosquitoes are spreading the disease through the way their eggs and larvae have been exported from native forest haunts in south east Asia in tyre imports. The grubs eggs can survive for months and larvae and pupae develop in small pockets of water retained by tyres. To counter the threat, the authorities are maintaining a \"mosquito surveillance programme\" at 30 UK ports and airports as well as checks at motorway services on routes from south coast ports and Eurotunnel. Dr Jenny Harries, deputy medical director at Public Health England, said: \"Through these activities we identified a small number of eggs and larvae from the _Aedes albopictus_ mosquito in traps at Ashford International truck stop.

The members are some of the leading experts in the world in their respective fields.  The International Health Regulations (IHR) is an international legal agreement that is binding on 194 States Parties across the globe, including all of the Member States of WHO. The basic purpose of the IHR is to help the international community prevent and respond to acute public health risks that have the potential to cross borders and threaten people worldwide.  In January 2010, the WHO Executive Board requested a proposal from the Director-General on how to assess the international response to the pandemic influenza, and then approved her suggestion to convene the IHR Review Committee to review both the pandemic response and the functioning of the IHR.  The pandemic H1N1 is the first public health emergency of international concern to occur since the revised IHR came into force. The IHR played a central role in the global response to the pandemic and so review of the IHR and review of the global handling of the pandemic influenza are closely related.  The IHR facilitate coordinated international action by requiring countries to report certain disease outbreaks and public health events to WHO so that global reporting of important public health events is timely and open.  The IHR were first implemented (i.e., \"entered into force\") worldwide in 2007 and the Health Assembly determined that a first review of its functioning is to take place by the 63rd World Health Assembly in May 2010.  Objectives  The review has three key objectives:  Assess the functioning of the International Health Regulations (2005);  Assess the ongoing global response to the pandemic H1N1 (including the role of WHO); and  Identify lessons learned important for strengthening preparedness and response for future pandemics and public health emergencies.  The committee  The IHR Review Committee is made up of approximately 29 members who have been selected from the roster of experts under the IHR structure or other WHO expert committees. The committee members represent a broad mix of expertise, practical experience and backgrounds, and includes experts from developed and developing countries.  The members are some of the leading experts in the world in their respective fields. They are not WHO staff, nor do they receive funding from WHO for their contributions to the review process. Names of the committee members were made public prior to the first meeting:  List of members of the review committee  At the first meeting, Professor Harvey V. Fineberg was elected as chair; Professor Babatunde Osotimehin was elected as vice chair.  The IHR Review Committee is considered a WHO expert committee and so its operations and structure follows regulations for WHO expert advisory panels and committees, and provisions of the IHR.  Proceedings  The committee will determine its methods and schedule of work.  The first meeting is scheduled for 12-14 April 2010 at WHO headquarters in Geneva.  Observers invited to the first meeting include representatives of all States Parties to the IHR (194 countries), United Nations organizations and relevant intergovernmental organizations, and nongovernmental organizations in official relations with WHO.  The committee will advise the Director-General of its views and findings. Based on the committee's advice, the Director-General will provide an interim report to the World Health Assembly (WHA) in May 2010, and an expected second, final report to the WHA in May 2011.  Participation by countries (IHR States Parties)  Countries will have the opportunity to make brief statements to the committee at first meeting, and may also submit comments to the Review Committee on key issues, concerns and lessons learned related to the pandemic response and functioning of the IHR.  More about the IHR  In the globalized world, diseases can rapidly spread far and wide via international travel and trade. A health crisis in one country can impact livelihoods and economies in many parts of the world. Emerging infections such as an influenza pandemic are an important cause of such events. However, other public health emergencies such as chemical spills, leaks and dumping, or nuclear melt-downs may similarly have global effects.  The IHR are not specific for any one disease or group of diseases but generally aim to limit interference with international traffic and trade while ensuring public health through the prevention of disease spread. The IHR define the rights and obligations of countries to report public health events, and establish a number of procedures that WHO must follow in its work to uphold global public health security. The IHR also require countries to strengthen their existing capacities for public health surveillance and response.

The health department investigation is looking at multiple reports of persons ill with watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and vomiting symptoms consistent with vibriosis  after eating raw oysters from one of several restaurants and markets in King County. For each retail/restaurant location reported, Environmental Health inspectors conducted on site investigations to ensure that the oysters were from approved sources, being cold held properly (at refrigeration temperatures at or below 41 deg F 5 deg C) and handled in such a way to minimize the risk of cross-contaminations (where bacteria from one bad oyster could be spread to a whole batch, or to other foods). The _Vibrio_ bacterium is naturally found in salty, brackish waters where oysters are grown. Therefore, while temperature violations before and after delivery to restaurants can contribute to the growth of _Vibrio_, the restaurants are not the direct source of _Vibrio_ in oysters. According to Public Health  Seattle & King County epidemiologist, Jenny Lloyd: To minimize the risk of _Vibrio_ infection, practice safe shellfish preparation (such as keeping shellfish cold (less than 41 deg F 5 deg C) and cook shellfish thoroughly, following these guidelines. People who take antacids, have suppressed immune systems, or some other chronic health conditions are more likely to get sick and should consider avoiding raw oyster consumption.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. However, since global warming is truly occurring, this pathogen and others are occurring in areas previously not seeing it and with shellfish being shipped quickly from warmer to colder areas, the old adage is not very helpful anymore. Successful isolation of _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ from diarrheic stools must start with consideration of this particular organism, as _Vibrio_ spp. and a number of organisms, including the enteropaths of _E. coli_, require special media to either facilitate growth (_Vibrio_ spp. require higher salinity and are referred to as halophilic) or aid to identification (_E. coli_ O157 can be screened for using its lack of fermentation of sorbitol). With the availability of DNA screening panels for stool, non-cultural diagnostic methodology is being much more commonly used. - Mod. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ ", "dates": ["Date: Wed 19 Jul 2017", "In a follow-up to a report last week [week of 10 Jul 2017] concerning"], "title": "Vibrio parahaemolyticus - USA: (WA) "}, "605": {"sentences": "OMS | Planificaci\u00f3n, finanzas y rendici\u00f3n de cuentas  Ir al contenido principal  Access  Home Alt+0  Navigation Alt+1  Content Alt+2  Buscar  Buscar en WHO.int  Submit  B\u00fasqueda avanzada  Navigation  Acceso  Temas de salud  Datos y estad\u00edsticas  Centro de prensa  Publicaciones  Pa\u00edses  Programas y proyectos  Gobernanza  Acerca de la OMS  Language  \u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a  \u4e2d\u6587  English  Fran\u00e7ais  \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439  Espa\u00f1ol  Acerca de la OMS  Men\u00fa de navegaci\u00f3n  Acerca de la OMS  Nuestras actividades  D\u00f3nde trabajamos  Gobernanza  Alianzas y colaboraciones  Alianzas  Alianzas acogidas  Otros programas, servicios y secretar\u00edas acogidos por la OMS  Documentaci\u00f3n de la OMS sobre alianzas  Planificaci\u00f3n, finanzas y rendici\u00f3n de cuentas  Reformas de la OMS  Programas y establecimiento de prioridades  Reforma de la gobernanza  Reforma de la gesti\u00f3n  Proceso de reforma de la OMS: documentaci\u00f3n  Capacidad ante emergencias  Grupo asesor  Comit\u00e9 de Asesoramiento y Supervisi\u00f3n  Planificaci\u00f3n, finanzas y rendici\u00f3n de cuentas  La presente secci\u00f3n contiene informaci\u00f3n sobre c\u00f3mo nos financiamos, los m\u00e9todos de presentaci\u00f3n de informes y los mecanismos de rendici\u00f3n de cuentas.

Fish Health Inspectorate (FHI) officers found koi herpesvirus (KHV) in fish at The Lakeside, a small lake surrounded by residential streets just off the A30/London Road. The outbreak could mean all fish in the lake must be culled, unless a 4-year monitoring programme is implemented. According to Gov.UK's science blog, \"KHV is a viral disease of common carp (_Cyprinus carpio_) and all its varieties, such as mirror, leather, ghost, koi etc. \"The disease occurs at higher water temperatures (over 16 C 60 F), is highly contagious, and may cause up to 100% mortality. Infected fish shed the virus in faeces, urine, and mucus from the gills and skin. The disease is transmitted by fish-to-fish contact, and also via angling equipment and contaminated water.\" It added that \"there is no risk to public health.\"  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. The disease is transmitted by fish-to-fish contact, and it is also possible that the disease can spread through contaminated water, nets and other equipment. As with other herpesviruses, KHD has the capacity to remain latent in the infected fish and become activated and cause disease when some stressor triggers it. More information on KHD can be found in OIE's Aquatic Manual chapter (2009 update), which is available at  . - Mod.PMB   .

All 41 patients had synovial fluid or knee tissue obtained during surgery collected for culture, and cultures were positive for 15 (37 percent) patients. Bacteria recovered included _Streptococcus mitis-oralis_ (10 patients), _Abiotrophia defectiva_ (2), _Staphylococcus aureus_ (2), _Actinomyces odontolyticus_ (1), alpha-hemolytic _Streptococcus_ (1), _Eikenella corrodens_ (1), _Haemophilus parainfluenzae_ (1), _Neisseria oralis_ (1), _Streptococcus gordonii_ (1), _Streptococcus intermedius-milleri_ (1), _Streptococcus sanguinis_ (1), and _Veillonella_ (1); 5 patients had polymicrobial infections. Cultures from 26 (63 percent) patients were negative. All recovered organisms are commonly found in oral flora (1,2). In addition to bacteria recovered from culture of synovial fluid or tissue, _Staphylococcus aureus_ was isolated from the blood of 2 patients. On 13 Mar 2017, MCRHC, NJDOH, and the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs representing the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners conducted an unannounced visit to practice A to inspect the premises, interview staff members, observe infection prevention practices, and review records. Because the practice remained closed to patients at this time, mock procedures were observed during the visit. Multiple breaches in infection prevention recommendations were identified. Staff members did not have access to a handwashing sink, and alcohol-based hand rub was not available in medication preparation or treatment areas. Staff members, operating under the mistaken belief that PBP products could be used as multiple-dose containers outside of pharmacy conditions (such as, use of a laminar flow hood, appropriate garbing, staff training, and environmental monitoring), accessed a 50 mL PBP container of contrast material up to 50 times to prepare syringes for multiple patients, with the septum of the container cleaned with alcohol only before the initial draw. Staff members prepared injections in a separate room, away from the patient treatment area; however, pharmacy conditions necessary for batch preparation of syringes and use of PBP products were not in place. In addition, injectable medications were drawn into syringes by medical assistants up to 4 days in advance of procedures, contrary to the recommended practice of administering medication from single-dose vials within 1 hour of preparation (3). Injections were initiated using a needle and syringe filled with local anesthetic. After injecting the anesthetic, the physician removed the syringe, leaving the needle within the intra-articular space. A 2nd syringe containing contrast material from the PBP container was then attached to the needle hub and used to facilitate fluoroscopic needle placement. This was followed by replacement with a 3rd syringe containing a glucocorticoid or hyaluronic acid-based product. The physician did not wear a face mask during joint injection procedures and used nonsterile gloves to manipulate the needle hub during procedures. Practice A was advised to immediately stop batch preparation of syringes and use of PBP products for multiple patients and to hire an infection preventionist to assess staff competency and ensure that hand hygiene, standard precautions, and safe injection practices were followed. No additional cases occurred after these measures were implemented.<br><br><strong> Discussion -</strong><br> An investigation of 41 cases of septic arthritis associated with intra-articular injections at an outpatient practice in New Jersey identified multiple breaches of recommended infection prevention practices during the preparation and administration of PBP products, which are intended for use in a pharmacy setting, using standards outlined by the United States Pharmacopeial Convention (USP) (3,4). PBP products are restricted to preparation of admixtures only in a suitable work area as defined by USP, such as in a laminar flow hood, and handled in accordance with sterile compounding standards outlined by the manufacturer and USP (3,4). CDC guidelines call for medications labeled as \"single-dose\" or \"single-use\" to be used for only one patient (5,6). Single-use medications, including PBP products, typically lack antimicrobial preservatives and can become contaminated and serve as a source of microorganisms when handled inappropriately (6). Use of a PBP product as a multiple-dose container outside of pharmacy conditions could contaminate the container and serve as a source of pathogens for multiple patients. Because practice A used a single PBP container of contrast material for as many as 50 patients, contamination of only a single container could account for the large number of cases identified in this outbreak. Proper hand hygiene should be performed before handling any medications. In addition, batch preparation of medication for future administration should be performed in accordance with sterile compounding standards recommended by USP (3). In this outbreak, all pathogens isolated were oral flora. CDC recommends that health care personnel wear face masks for spinal injection procedures that require injection of material or insertion of a catheter into epidural or subdural spaces (such as, myelogram, administration of spinal or epidural anesthesia, or intrathecal chemotherapy) (5). Multiple outbreaks have demonstrated the risk for bacterial meningitis associated with droplet transmission of oral flora from health care personnel to patients during spinal injection procedures. The Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology recommends the use of a face mask to contain respiratory droplets when preparing and injecting material into an intra-articular space (7). The use of multiple syringes with a single intra-articular needle could serve as a conduit for organisms to enter directly into the joint space if the needle hub is left exposed to potential respiratory droplets. Although this is a potential mechanism for a single case, it is unlikely to explain the large number of cases identified in this outbreak. No additional septic arthritis cases were identified after infection prevention recommendations were implemented within the practice. The findings from this investigation highlight the need for better adherence to and oversight of basic infection prevention recommendations and sterile compounding standards in outpatient settings (8,9).

The outbreak described in the MMWR report above involved multiple breaks in infection control procedures required to safeguard injection practices ( ). This outbreak occurred in an office-based outpatient setting where scrutiny may not be as intense as in hospitals (1,2). Contaminated injections are especially hazardous when accompanied by use of immunosuppressive drugs, such as corticosteroids, which occurred in many of the patients in the reported outbreak.<br><br><strong> References </strong><br> 1.

While there are no vaccines for humans to prevent mosquito-borne illness, horses can get vaccines for Eastern Equine Encephalitis and the West Nile Virus. \"While we see these types of reports each year, it's still important for us to remember the importance of preventing mosquito bites whenever possible,\" says Kenneth Lowery, district epidemiologist. \"Mosquito borne illnesses can cause severe sickness, brain damage or death in some cases.\" To prevent mosquito bites are:  - Use insect repellent containing DEET, picardin, IR3535 or oil of lemon eucalyptus on exposed skin and/or clothing;  - Wear long sleeves and pants when weather permits;  - Have secure, intact screens on windows and doors to keep mosquitoes out;  - Empty standing water from flower pots, buckets, barrels, wading pools and other containers.

Brooks County is on the southern border of Georgia with Florida, and considering the frequency of EEE in Florida this report is not surprising; see  . EEEv infections kill horses so it is well worth routinely vaccinating your horses each Spring. Too many owners procrastinate and say \"when I hear of a case I will get my horses vaccinated.\" The problem is it is their horses that are the trigger cases. So get your horses vaccinated. It can be a very nasty disease in humans, and in my experience the further north you go and mosquitoes get less dense, the greater the probability of brain lesions. Here in Louisiana we have few human EEE cases and they are usually mild and go home in fair condition. And mosquito activity is around 49 weeks of the year with a high probability of \"herd\" immunity. Further north, cases match the textbooks. - Mod.MHJ   .

Persistent anthrax as a major driver of wildlife mortality in a tropical rainforest. Nature 2017; 548: 82-86. doi:10.<br><br><strong>1038/nature23309 -</strong><br> Anthrax is a globally important animal disease and zoonosis. Despite this, our current knowledge of anthrax ecology is largely limited to arid ecosystems, where outbreaks are most commonly reported. Here we show that the dynamics of an anthrax-causing agent, _Bacillus cereus biovar anthracis_, in a tropical rainforest have severe consequences for local wildlife communities. Using data and samples collected over 3 decades, we show that rainforest anthrax is a persistent and widespread cause of death for a broad range of mammalian hosts. We predict that this pathogen will accelerate the decline and possibly result in the extirpation of local chimpanzee (_Pan troglodytes verus_) populations. We present the epidemiology of a cryptic pathogen and show that its presence has important implications for conservation. selected paragraphs Bcbva-positive carcasses were broadly distributed throughout the TNP Tai National Park, in Cote d'Ivoire research area, without the kind of geographic clustering described for anthrax in savannah ecosystems 12, 22. We determined Bcbva prevalence within and outside the research area using a subset of 908 flies caught systematically according to a grid system within 19 days. We detected Bcbva-positive flies in 16 out of 83 traps. Prevalence was higher in the research area (8 out of 21 traps were Bcbva-positive) than in the surrounding forest belt (8 out of 62 traps were Bcbva-positive) (Fisher's exact test, P\u2009=\u20090.02). Long-term research activity within the TNP research area has had a protective effect on wildlife and led to an increased density of mammals 23, which might explain higher Bcbva activity. Genome data revealed multiple contemporaneous transmission chains caused by co-circulating strains (2-48 SNPs distance, median: 25 SNPs) in different areas of the park over the short time period of the fly snapshot. For low genomic distances (\u226435 SNPs), genomic and geographic distances of all TNP isolates were positively correlated (R2\u2009=\u20090.72), providing further indication of spatially restricted transmission, which might reflect carcass-mediated spread of Bcbva. Because wildlife cases included exclusively arboreal monkeys, we explored the vertical distribution of Bcbva by catching flies simultaneously on the ground and up to 30\u2009m in the canopy. We detected Bcbva in 12 out of 103 canopy flies (11.7 percent) and retrieved isolates from 5 of these. While on the ground carcass-deposition sites are likely to be the source of Bcbva infections, flies may contribute to Bcbva transmission in the upper strata of the rainforest 24. Fly samples indicated a large proportion of undetected anthrax mortality. During 19 days of focused fly sampling, we retrieved Bcbva isolates from 17 flies, with 13 strains being more than 2 SNPs different from any other strain. Because 2 SNPs appear to be the upper level of within-host diversity, this implies the presence of at least 13 different Bcbva-positive carcasses. Yet, during the same sampling period, only 3 Bcbva-positive carcasses were discovered and their isolates all corresponded to one of the fly Bcbva lineages (\u22642 SNPs difference). This suggests carcass monitoring alone underestimates mortality by at least an order of magnitude. We investigated the consequences of Bcbva-induced mortality on the species best studied in this ecosystem, chimpanzees. Chimpanzees have a low reproduction rate 25 and are thus particularly sensitive towards external changes to their environment. On the basis of demographic data collected from habituated groups in TNP, we simulated population viability at a 150 years horizon across a broad range of demographic models, which included or excluded anthrax-induced mortality. Our simulations showed that, with Bcbva, the TNP chimpanzee population would only have high chances to persist in the case of an overall annual per capita mortality rate owing to other causes of 1 per cent. Such a low mortality rate is, however, not even observed in captive chimpanzees. In wild chimpanzees the lowest annual per capita mortality rate is 4 per cent (in early adults). Under such a survival probability (0.96), the simulated presence of anthrax invariably led to a clearly reduced survival probability of communities. For example, 76 out of 84 models resulted in an extirpation probability that was higher than 50 per cent, whereas the model, which we consider the most realistic (community size 60, maximum age 46 years and inter-birth interval 6 years), resulted in an extirpation probability of 89 per cent. Our simulations therefore suggest that anthrax-induced mortality will result in deterministic population declines and possible extirpation of TNP chimpanzees over the next 150 years. The risk of extirpation will increase if chimpanzee mortality due to hunting and human-borne infectious diseases continues to rise. To determine whether similar unrecognized effects on wildlife might be occurring elsewhere, we tested 784 flies collected at 8 different sites, as well as 136 bones from 12 sites in 5 and 9 sub-Saharan countries, respectively. All sites had chimpanzee populations but none (nor the country) had previously reported Bcbva cases. We only detected Bcbva genetic material in 2 out of 105 flies and one out of 8 bones collected in the Grebo National Forest in Liberia, about 40\u2009km 24.85 milesfrom TNP. The genome sequences of isolates from the 2 fly samples nested within the diversity of Bcbva in TNP, which may indicate an epidemiological link. We did not detect Bcbva in 305 flies from 2 sites where Bcbva cases have previously been reported (Dja Reserve, Cameroon, and Dzanga Sangha Protected Areas, Central African Republic). Although the lack of detection at other sites needs to be interpreted with caution owing to variable fly species composition, these data suggest that Bcbva dynamics may also vary across rainforest ecosystems. It will be important to further uncover the scale and environmental drivers behind Bcbva prevalence. Such knowledge will be critical for mitigating against the detrimental effects of Bcbva on wildlife and for better assessing human infection risk, which for anthrax in rainforest ecosystems has, to date, been considered very low. see URL above for references numbered in the text.  communicated by: ProMED-mail This is a long but sound paper and well worth reading.

The Ministry of Health said in a statement on Sat 5 Aug 2017 that the patient, who lived at Yishun Avenue 7 and worked at Teban Gardens, developed fever and swelling of the neck on 30 Jul 2017. On Tue 1 Aug 2017, he sought medical treatment at Khoo Teck Phuat Hospital, where he was immediately isolated and hospitalised. He died 3 days later on Fri 4 Aug 2017. His respiratory sample tested positive for toxigenic _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, which causes the disease. \"As he had not travelled out of Singapore recently, he was likely to have been infected in Singapore,\" said the ministry in its statement. The last local case of diphtheria was reported in 1992, while the last imported case was in 1996. The respiratory disease is preventable by vaccine, and the risk of it spreading here is low. Vaccination against diphtheria has been made compulsory by law for children under the National Childhood Immunisation Programme since 1962. About 96 to 98 per cent of Singaporean children aged 2 years old are vaccinated against the disease. The ministry also added that it is screening the patient's close contacts, including those who lived in the same dormitory and worked in the same workplace. Among the 48 people who have been identified for \"further assessment\", 2 \"close contacts\" have developed sore throat since Thu 3 Aug 2017. They are currently under isolation at Khoo Teck Phuat Hospital. \"All 48 contacts have been given preventive medication and a booster diphtheria vaccine, and their respiratory samples have been taken for testing,\" said the ministry. Diphtheria is transmitted from person to person via the respiratory route through close contact with an affected person. Symptoms include fever or chills, sore throat, swelling of the neck, and nasal discharge. The disease can cause infection of the airway, which may lead to breathing difficulties and death. It is fatal in 5-10 per cent of cases, with a higher fatality rate among young children. The best way to prevent diphtheria is to get vaccinated, which reduces the mortality and morbidity of the disease \"dramatically\", said the ministry. The diphtheria toxin is responsible both for local tissue destruction and membrane formation in the nose and throat and the major complications of acute renal failure, myocarditis and neuritis. The membrane itself may cause airway obstruction. Humans are the reservoir for _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, which is transmitted by droplets from the respiratory tract of an infected person. Diphtheria is treated with diphtheria antitoxin to stop the effects of the toxin and antibiotics to eradicate the organism. Vaccination of clinical cases is required because clinical diphtheria does not necessarily confer immunity. Diphtheria patients are usually kept in isolation until they are no longer contagious, as demonstrated by negative cultures of 2 samples obtained at least 24 hours apart after completion of a 14 day course of antimicrobial therapy, although patients are usually no longer contagious about 48 hours after starting antibiotics ( ). All close contacts of a case should be monitored for signs/symptoms of diphtheria for at least 7 days and have swabs taken for culture from their throat and nose, regardless of their immunization status. A prophylactic course of 7 days of oral erythromycin or a single dose of benzathine penicillin IM is recommended for close contacts. Close contacts with positive cultures should have 2 repeat cultures a minimum of 2 weeks after completion of antimicrobials to assure eradication of the organism, and, if repeat cultures are positive, an additional 10-day course of erythromycin or penicillin is recommended, followed by 2 repeat cultures. Unvaccinated contacts should be started on their primary course of vaccine. Vaccinated contacts should be given a booster injection of vaccine if more than 5 years have elapsed since their previous dose ( ). Teban Gardens, where the patient worked, is a residential precinct located in Jurong East, a planning area in the West Region of Singapore ( ). Yishun Avenue 7, where the patient lived, is in the Yishun planning area in North Region of Singapore ( ). - Mod.ML   .

Of the 18 cases, 12 are children and 6 are adults. All reported illnesses are associated with playing in the water at Commodore Beach in Lake Wildwood Nevada county or taking care of someone who is infected. The best method of prevention when caring for an ill person is frequent washing and drying of your hands. There have been a total of 10 hospitalizations and of those, 9 have been discharged home. To date, of those with laboratory-confirmed _E. coli_ O157, the onset of symptoms has ranged from 20-29 Jul 2017. The Public Health Department will continue to follow up on reports of illness received from health care providers. The 5 public beaches at Lake Wildwood remain closed, and the no swimming advisory remains in effect for the lake. The Environmental Health Department continues to take samples from around the lake for testing; however, the cause of the outbreak remains under investigation. The Public Health Department would like to take this opportunity to remind you not to swim in any recreational waters or pools if you are experiencing any gastrointestinal symptoms, until at least 2 weeks after your symptoms are gone. Please consult your private medical provider should you have any concerns about your health.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail This is the 1st report that I have seen that confirms that the _E. coli_ was indeed a enterohemorrhagic (Shiga toxin producing) strain, specifically serotype O157, the prototypic serotype. Although _E. coli_ O157 is most often associated with undercooked ground beef, or contaminated food, the disease can also be transmitted when people drink, or swim in, tainted water. In the spring of 2000, in Walkerton, a town of 5000 in southern Ontario, an outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infection claimed 7 lives  6 adults and a child  and over 200 were seen at local area hospitals.

The health workers deputed from the District Health Office (DHO) have been treating locals with preventive medicines while the critical ones have been undergoing treatment in the Bahadurgunj Hospital in the district. Meanwhile, the DHO has urged the general public to take precautions and preventive measures as there is high risk of diarrhoea spreading in the flood-hit areas. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ Aggressive interventions to stem outbreaks of cholera include providing sources of clean water and a vaccination campaign. The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press): \"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility. \"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are: - Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_; - Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam; - Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61). \"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however, have suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be effective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and outbreak situations (63, 64).<br><br><strong> \"References -</strong><br> 57.

She had been taking amoxicillin for a dental infection. She was evaluated on 6 Jun 2017 for 4 days of fever, myalgia, anorexia, and diarrhea. Because of suspected colitis she was advised to discontinue amoxicillin; she declined hospital admission. Two days later, she was hospitalized for shortness of breath and confusion. Chest radiography revealed a right lower lobe pneumonia and an effusion. This was treated with cefepime and intravenous doxycycline. On 8 Jun 2017, her stool tested positive for _Clostridium difficile_ toxin A/B by polymerase chain reaction, requiring treatment with metronidazole and vancomycin. Her condition deteriorated, and she died on 11 Jun 2017. Tularemia was not suspected as cause of illness until 17 Jun 2017 when a blood culture collected on 6 Jun 2017 was confirmed as _F. tularensis_, a Tier 1 select agent; no laboratory exposures occurred. The patient lived in a semirural area of northern Arizona, did not engage in outdoor activities, and had no known history of insect bites, exposure to animal carcasses or untreated water. She traveled to Hawaii 16-26 May 2016, returning about 11 days before illness onset. Postmortem exam revealed no bites, abscesses, or lymphadenopathy. The patient's dog was noted to be lethargic and anorexic in late May 2016, 3 days after being found with a rabbit carcass in its mouth. The patient and dog had frequent close contact. Serum from the dog, obtained about 3 weeks after its illness and the patient's death, had a _F. tularensis_-specific titer of 1:256. An assessment of the property on 23 Jun 2017 revealed numerous rabbits and one squirrel carcass with _F. tularensis_ DNA detected in its liver and spleen. Genotyping of _F. tularensis_ from squirrel and human samples showed both infections were attributable to an A.II strain. About 125 human tularemia cases are reported in the USA annually. Humans are infected through arthropod bites, contact with infectious tissues, inhalation, or ingestion (1). Symptoms commonly begin 3-5 days after exposure and can include fever, skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, difficulty breathing, and diarrhea (1). 2 _F. tularensis_ subspecies, _tularensis_ (Type A) and _holarctica_ (Type B), cause human tularemia (1,2). Distinct clades within Type A (A.I and A.II) are associated with different virulence in humans and laboratory animals (2,3). A.II strains are localized to the western USA and associated with milder illness than are A.I strains (2,3). Based on the patient's respiratory symptoms, radiographic findings, and lack of alternative exposure history, exposure likely occurred at her property through inhalation of _F. tularensis_, potentially via close contact with her dog. The dog might have transmitted infectious material through oral secretions after mouthing an infected carcass or brought infectious material on its fur into contact with the patient. Human illness linked to dogs has been documented (3). The role of pulmonary sarcoidosis in this patient's illness is unclear, but it might have contributed to the severe outcome of infection with an A.II strain (4). Concurrent infection with _C. difficile_ might also have exacerbated the clinical course of tularemia. Diagnosis of tularemia is challenging because symptoms are nonspecific and exposure history is often unclear. Thorough ascertainment of animal exposures, including nature of contact, might refine clinical suspicion for specific zoonoses. Preventing exposure and implementing early, appropriate therapy can reduce morbidity and mortality. Additional information is available at  .<br><br><strong> References </strong><br> 1.

Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (as in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with or ingestion of infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbits) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional inflammation of a lymph node), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially and transovarially. Transstadial transmission occurs when a pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage (\"stadium\") to the next. Transovarial or transovarian transmission occurs in certain arthropod vectors as they transmit disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod, which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include _Dermacentor andersoni_ (wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (lone star tick), _Dermacentor variabilis_ (dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (deer fly). The infection does not spread from person to person essentially in contradiction to another Category A bioterrorism agent, _Yersinia pestis_, in which the pneumonic form can easily be transmitted. _F. tularensis_ infection can present in a variety of ways depending on the route of acquisition. Even before the antimicrobial era, pneumonia due to inhalation of _Francisella tularensis_ seemed to account for most of the deaths related to the infection (1).

Beginning in October 2014, locally transmitted cases of chikungunya have been reported in Mexico. Local transmission means that mosquitoes in Mexico have been infected with chikungunya and are spreading it to people. Chikungunya cases have also been reported in several countries in the Caribbean and Central and South America .  CDC recommends that travelers to Mexico protect themselves from chikungunya by preventing mosquito bites . Some travelers may be more likely to get chikungunya, have severe disease, or be at higher risk for other reasons. CDC advises travelers in high-risk groups to discuss their travel plans with their health care provider. These groups include the following:  People who have arthritis  People with serious underlying medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, or diabetes)  People older than 65  Women who are late in their pregnancies, because of the risk to babies born at the time their mother is sick  Long-term travelers, including missionaries and humanitarian aid workers and people visiting friends and relatives  People who might have difficulty avoiding mosquito bites, such as those planning to spend a lot of time outdoors or staying in rooms without window screens or air conditioning.  What can travelers do to prevent chikungunya?  Learn more about chikungunya .  There is currently no vaccine or medicine to prevent chikungunya. The only way to prevent chikungunya is to prevent mosquito bites. Preventing bites can be difficult, but it is important as you can get sick after just one bite. Follow these steps to reduce the chances that you will be bitten by mosquitoes during your trip.  Prevent mosquito bites:  Cover exposed skin by wearing long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and hats.  Use an appropriate insect repellent as directed.  Higher percentages of active ingredient provide longer protection. Use products with the following active ingredients:  DEET  Picaridin (also known as KBR 3023, Bayrepel, and icaridin)  Oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE) or PMD  IR3535  2-undecanone (methyl nonyl ketone)  Always follow product directions and reapply as directed:  If you are also using sunscreen, apply sunscreen first and insect repellent second.  Follow package directions when applying repellent on children . Avoid applying repellent to their hands, eyes, and mouth.  Treated clothing remains protective after multiple washings. See the product information to find out how long the protection will last.  If treating items yourself, follow the product instructions carefully.  Do not use permethrin directly on skin.  Use permethrin-treated clothing and gear (such as boots, pants, socks, and tents). You can buy pre-treated clothing and gear or treat them yourself:  Stay and sleep in screened or air conditioned rooms.  Use a bed net if the area where you are sleeping is exposed to the outdoors.  If you feel sick and think you may have chikungunya:  Talk to your doctor or nurse if you feel seriously ill, especially if you have a fever.  Tell them about your travel.  For more information about medical care abroad, see Getting Health Care Abroad and a list of International Joint Commission-accredited facilities.  Use acetaminophen or paracetamol to treat fever and pain.  Get lots of rest, and drink plenty of liquids.  Avoid spreading the disease by preventing more mosquito bites.

The outbreak investigation is ongoing. It has been challenging because of the long incubation period of the disease (15 to 50 days) and the difficulty experienced to contact many individuals sickened with the illness who are homeless and/or illicit drug users. To date, no common source of food, beverage, or other cause has been identified; as a result, the source of the outbreak remains undetermined. Vaccination efforts are being implemented in targeted locations by county staff and in collaboration with health care partners. Health providers are asked to inform the Epidemiology Program if they have a patient suspected to have the hepatitis A infection, before the patient leaves the emergency department or provider's office (see contact number below). The table below will provide a weekly update of total cases, deaths, and hospitalizations. Following this update is information about hepatitis A to educate the community and help prevent the continual spread of this viral infection.<br><br><strong> San Diego County hepatitis A outbreak cases and deaths as of 8 Aug 2017 </strong><br> Cases / Deaths / Hospitalizations 312 / 10 / 215 (69 percent) Please note: the table does not include all reported hepatitis A cases in the county; only those that are local-outbreak-related. Also, data are provisional and subject to change.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. The number of cases of diagnosed hepatitis A (HAV) in San Diego County in southern California continues to increase.<br><br><strong> Date / Cases / Hospitalized (percentage) / Deaths (percentage) -</strong><br> 5 Apr 2017 / 39 / 33 (85) / 1 (3) 4 May 2017 / 80 / 66 (83) / 3 (4) 31 May 2017 / 133 / 103 (80) / 3 (2) 12 Jun 2017 / 160 / 120 (75) / 4 (2.5) 27 Jun 2017 / 196 / 142 (72) / 4 (2) 26 Jul 2017 / 275 / 194 (71) / 7 (2.5) 1 Aug 2017 / 295 / 202 (68) / 10 (3.4) 8 Aug 2017 / 312 / 215 (69) / 10 (3.2) In the past week, 17 cases have been reported with no additional deaths. Since many cases of HAV infection are asymptomatic or anicteric (without jaundice), the total number of cases is likely to have been significantly higher. It is not clear whether the newer cases are truly new or just newly reported older cases. An epidemiologic curve showing the date of onset of symptoms of cases over time could assist in this regard. Thus, it remains unclear whether the persistent increase is related to slow reporting, increased awareness and testing, secondary cases, or the persistent source or sources in the environment. The very high hospitalization rate may be related to the homelessness of the cohort but could represent a more virulent strain. HAV infection occurred in some individuals chronically infected with either hepatitis B or C, but it is not clear whether the fatalities occurred in those individuals. Homelessness and illicit substance use seem to be relevant risk factors, while MSM men who have sex with men practices are not. It remains unclear how and from what vehicle the virus is spreading. - Mod.LL ", "dates": ["Date: Tue 8 Aug 2017", "312 / 10 / 215 (69 percent)", "5 Apr 2017 / 39 / 33 (85) / 1 (3)", "4 May 2017 / 80 / 66 (83) / 3 (4)", "31 May 2017 / 133 / 103 (80) / 3 (2)", "12 Jun 2017 / 160 / 120 (75) / 4 (2", "27 Jun 2017 / 196 / 142 (72) / 4 (2)", "26 Jul 2017 / 275 / 194 (71) / 7 (2", "1 Aug 2017 / 295 / 202 (68) / 10 (3", "8 Aug 2017 / 312 / 215 (69) / 10 (3"], "title": "Hepatitis A - USA (18): (CA) fatal "}, "340": {"sentences": "   Wed 26 Jul 2017 Source: SciDevNet edited An invasive and virulent strain of _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhimurium that emerged in Sub-Saharan Africa has been identified elsewhere for the 1st time, scientists have reported. The bacteria can cause a severe gut infection with symptoms including fever, nausea and vomiting. It can even cause death. The strain, known as ST313 ST is short for sequence type, has been found in Brazil, reports an article in the July 2017 edition of the journal Infection, Genetics and Evolution. Until now, it had been recorded only in Sub-Saharan Africa, where it kills a quarter of people who fall ill, particularly vulnerable patients infected with HIV or malaria, and malnourished children. \"These results should alert health authorities in the country, because infections with this bacterium are not subject to mandatory reporting, said Cristiano Gallina Moreira. Unlike other subtypes of _S._ Typhimurium, ST313 is readily able to cross from the gut into the bloodstream. The research team sequenced the genomes of 88 strains of _S._ Typhimurium in the labs of the US Food and Drug Administration. They isolated the strains from stool, blood and brain abscess samples collected from infected people, and also from contaminated foods gathered from across Brazil between 1983 and 2013. They found the ST313 strain in samples isolated between 1989 and 2003 in Sao Paulo, the country's largest and richest city. The team also verified that the ST313 strain invades and replicates in phagocytes (cells that protect the body from infection) more easily than do other _Salmonella_ varieties. Biomedical scientist Fernanda Almeida, from University of Sao Paulo's Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeiro Preto (FCFRP-USP) and lead author of the research, says that, unlike the African strain, the new strain does not show signs of antibacterial resistance. \"But the Brazilian ST313 is much more aggressive and invasive, which is a problem,\" she told SciDev.Net. _S._ Typhimurium is one of the main causes of gastroenteritis globally. It can infect livestock such as pigs and lambs, and people can get infected by eating contaminated or improperly cooked meat. For biologist Cristiano Gallina Moreira, from the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences at Sao Paulo State University, the rise of a new strain of _S._ Typhimurium in Brazil is \"very worrisome.\" According to Vanessa Sperandio, a biochemist from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in the USA, sequencing the ST313 genome will help to accelerate the diagnosis of salmonellosis and more efficiently control potential outbreaks of the disease. But she pointed out that although this strain is much more dangerous than others, pharmaceutical companies are unlikely to develop a vaccine due to the low return on investment.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Infect Genet Evol 2017; 51: 41-44. It is clear that _S._ Typhimurium sequence type 313 has a propensity for bloodstream invasion. The following 2 publications report on mechanisms related to ST313's facilitation of a \"systemic lifestyle\" like _S._ Typhi and Paratyphi A: Carden S, Okoro C, Dougan G, Monack D: Non-typhoidal Salmonella Typhimurium ST313 isolates that cause bacteremia in humans stimulate less inflammasome activation than ST19 isolates associated with gastroenteritis. Pathog Dis. 2015 Jun;73(4). pii: ftu023. doi: 10.1093/femspd/ftu023.<br><br><strong> Abstract </strong><br> Salmonella is an enteric pathogen that causes a range of diseases in humans. Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) serovars such as _Salmonella enterica_ serovar Typhimurium generally cause a self-limiting gastroenteritis whereas typhoidal serovars cause a systemic disease, typhoid fever. However, _S._ Typhimurium isolates within the multi-locus sequence type ST313 have emerged in sub-Saharan Africa as a major cause of bacteremia in humans. The _S._ Typhimurium ST313 lineage is phylogenetically distinct from classical _S._ Typhimurium lineages, such as ST19, that cause zoonotic gastroenteritis worldwide. Previous studies have shown that the ST313 lineage has undergone genome degradation when compared to the ST19 lineage, similar to that observed for typhoidal serovars. Currently, little is known about phenotypic differences between ST313 isolates and other NTS isolates. We find that representative ST313 isolates invade non-phagocytic cells less efficiently than the classical ST19 isolates that are more commonly associated with gastroenteritis. In addition, ST313 isolates induce less Caspase-1-dependent macrophage death and IL-1\u03b2 release than ST19 isolates. ST313 isolates also express relatively lower levels of mRNA of the genes encoding the SPI-1 effector sopE2 and the flagellin, fliC, providing possible explanations for the decrease in invasion and inflammasome activation. The ST313 isolates have invasion and inflammatory phenotypes that are intermediate; more invasive and inflammatory than _Salmonella enterica_ serovar Typhi and less than ST19 isolates associated with gastroenteritis. This suggests that both phenotypically and at the genomic level ST313 isolates are evolving signatures that facilitate a systemic lifestyle in humans It appears that the next to last sentence is reversed and should be \"...less invasive and inflammatory than _Salmonella enterica_ serovar Typhi and more than ST19 isolates associated with gastroenteritis.\" - Mod.LL.

A novel genotype of _Salmonella enterica_ subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium (multi-locus sequence type ST 313) circulating in this geographic region is genetically different to from _S._ Typhimurium ST19 strains that are common throughout the rest of the world. _S._ Typhimurium ST313 strains have acquired pseudogenes and genetic deletions and appear to be evolving to become more like the typhoidal serovars _S._ Typhi and _S._ Paratyphi A. Epidemiological and clinical data show that _S._ Typhimurium ST313 strains are clinically associated with invasive systemic disease (bacteremia, septicemia, meningitis) rather than with gastroenteritis. The current work summarizes investigations of the broad hypothesis that _S._ Typhimurium ST313 isolates from Mali, West Africa, will behave differently from ST19 isolates in various in vitro assays. Here, we show that strains of the ST313 genotype are phagocytosed more efficiently and are highly resistant to killing by macrophage cell lines and primary mouse and human macrophages compared to ST19 strains. _S._ Typhimurium ST313 strains survived and replicated within different macrophages. Infection of macrophages with _S._ Typhimurium ST19 strains resulted in increased apoptosis and higher production of proinflammatory cytokines, as measured by gene expression and protein production, compared to S. Typhimurium ST313 strains. This difference in proinflammatory cytokine production and cell death between _S._ Typhimurium ST19 and ST313 strains could be explained, in part, by an increased production of flagellin by ST19 strains. These observations provide further evidence that _S._ Typhimurium ST313 strains are phenotypically different to ST19 strains and instead share similar pathogenic characteristics with typhoidal _Salmonella_ serovars. - Mod.LL   .

What is cholera?  Cholera is a disease spread by drinking water or eating food contaminated with cholera bacteria. Severe cholera is characterized by large amounts of watery diarrhea, often described as &ldquo;rice-water stool&rdquo; because it can have a pale, milky appearance. It can also be accompanied by nausea and vomiting. If untreated, the loss of fluid can be deadly. But simple treatment, including replacing lost body fluids, can lower the risk of death to less than 1%.  What can travelers do to prevent cholera?  Because it is spread through contaminated food and water, cholera is easily prevented by sticking to safe eating and drinking habits and regularly washing hands .  A newly licensed cholera vaccine (Vaxchora, PaxVax Corporation) prevents severe diarrhea caused by the most common type of cholera bacteria. This vaccine is available in the United States and is recommended by CDC for adults traveling to areas with active cholera transmission, such as Yemen. Avoiding unsafe food and water even after cholera vaccination will also help prevent cholera and many other diarrheal infections. Travelers should discuss the following questions with a healthcare provider when considering the vaccine:  How common is cholera where I am going?  How common is cholera in travelers to this area?  What would put me at risk for cholera?  Will I be able to receive rapid treatment (if needed) at my destination?

First serological evidence of hantavirus among febrile patients in Mozambique. Int J Infect Dis. 2017; 61:51-5. doi: 10.1016/j.ijid.2017.06.001.<br><br><strong> Epub 2017 Jun 7 -</strong><br> Highlights - this is the 1st serological investigation of hantavirus in Mozambique; - Mozambicans are exposed to hantaviruses; - hantavirus infection cases presented significantly higher levels of creatinine and alanine aminotransferase; - clinicians are unaware of hantaviruses and the virus occurs unsuspected; - most cases of hantavirus infections are misdiagnosed as malaria. Abstract Objective The occurrence of hantaviruses in Sub-Saharan Africa is poorly studied and its clinical implications are unknown. Methods Paired acute and convalescent samples from a total of 200 febrile patients aged older than 5 years who were recruited between February 2012 and October 2014 were screened for IgM and IgG antibodies against hantaviruses using an ELISA. Acute samples were also screened for malaria and to determine hematological and clinical chemistry parameters. Results Of the 200 patients enrolled, 4 had IgM antibodies in their acute sample and IgG antibodies in their convalescent sample, yielding a prevalence rate of 2 per cent. Contact with rodents was higher among IgM-positive participants than IgM-negative participants (50.0 per cent (2/4) vs. 15.3 per cent (30/196)). IgM-positive patients presented significantly higher levels of creatinine and alanine aminotransferase and lower platelet counts than IgM-negative patients. Conclusions The findings of this study demonstrate human exposure to hantaviruses in Mozambique for the 1st time; however, further studies should be conducted to investigate its clinical implications. One hopes that follow up studies will clarify that. Several hantaviruses have been identified in sub-Saharan Africa in recent years. Not all of these hantaviruses have been found in rodents. Sangassou virus was detected in the African wood mouse (_Hylomyscus simus_) but Tanganya virus (TGNV) in the Therese's shrew (_Crocidura theresae_), captured in Guinea. Recently, Azagny virus (AZGV) and Bow\u00e9 virus (BOWV), have been found in the West African pygmy shrew (_Crocidura obscurior_) in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and in the Doucet's musk shrew (_Crocidura douceti_) in Guinea. Of these viruses, Sangassou virus was responsible for febrile disease in humans. Human infection with other of these viruses has not been determined. - Mod. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ ", "dates": ["Date: Wed 7 Jun 2017", "2017; 61:51-5", " Epub 2017 Jun 7]", "2012 and October 2014 were screened for IgM and IgG antibodies against", "(30/196))"], "title": "Hantavirus - Africa: Mozambique (MC) "}, "473": {"sentences": "   Sat 12 Aug 2017 Source: Hachaklait Clinical Veterinary Services in Hebrew, trans.

The establishment's population includes several hundred cattle). One cow had to be euthanized and one pregnant heifer is recumbent, in serious condition. There was an abrupt drop in milk production within the herd, returning to reasonable levels within round 5 days. The BEF outbreak above in Kibutz Kfar Menachem was initially reported in Hachaklait's weekly report no. 2017/31, published Sat 5 Aug 2017. The clinical diagnosis was supported by PCR test. This herd had not been affected by BEF during previous seasons.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Kfar Menachem is located in central south Israel, some 33 km (20. According to a previous weekly report from \"Hachaklait\" (Israel's Cooperative Clinical Veterinary Services), in early June 2017 the practitioner attending the dairy operation at Kibutz Neve Ur reported several clinically suspected BEF cases. The said event was confirmed by seroconversion. BEF (\"3 day sickness\") is an insect-transmitted, noncontagious, viral disease of cattle and water buffalo that is seen in Africa, the Middle East, Australia, and Asia. The BEF virus (BEFV) is classified as a member of the genus _Ephemerovirus_ in the family Rhabdoviridae. Signs, which occur suddenly and vary in severity, can include biphasic to polyphasic fever, shivering, inappetence, lacrimation, serous nasal discharge, drooling, increased heart rate, tachypnea or dyspnea, atony of forestomachs, depression, stiffness and lameness, and a sudden decrease in milk yield. Affected cattle may become recumbent and paralyzed from 8 hours to more than 1 week. Morbidity may be high, mortality rate low. BEF causes considerable economical losses in the dairy and beef cattle industries. In Israel, the disease has been reported in previous years from dairy and beef cattle farms in various parts of the country; it is characterised by seasonal pattern related to vector activity. A countrywide BEF epizootic took place in 2014. An evaluation of a BEF vaccine applied in Israel was reported in ref 1. BEF is not zoonotic and is not listed by the OIE. BEF may be currently circulating in other Middle-Eastern countries, sharing the same eastern Mediterranean ecosystem.<br><br><strong> Reference -</strong><br> 1.

Zika virus (or Zika) has been reported in Anguilla. Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in Anguilla are infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:  Women who are pregnant:  Do not travel to Anguilla.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to Anguilla or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers considering pregnancy:  Before you or your partner travel, talk to your health care provider about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection.

Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.  If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex &ndash; or do not have sex &ndash; for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex, or do not have sex, for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy  Talk to your health care provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you&rsquo;re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Wait at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  Men are advised to wait longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.gov  Contact CDC  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  1600 Clifton Road  Atlanta ,  GA  30329-4027  USA  800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)  Contact CDC-INFO  TOP", "dates": [" Page created: June 28 2016", " Page last updated: August 08 2017", " Page last reviewed: August 08 2017", " 30329-4027", " 800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)"], "title": ["Zika Virus in Anguilla"]}, "669": {"sentences": "WHO | Philippines  Skip to main content  Access  Home Alt+0  Navigation Alt+1  Content Alt+2  Search  Search the  WHO .

Wait before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.  If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex &ndash; or do not have sex &ndash; for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex, or do not have sex, for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy  Talk to your health care provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you&rsquo;re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Wait at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  Men are advised to wait longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.gov  Contact CDC  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  1600 Clifton Road  Atlanta ,  GA  30329-4027  USA  800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)  Contact CDC-INFO  TOP", "dates": [" Page created: January 22 2016", " Page last updated: August 08 2017", " Page last reviewed: August 08 2017", " 30329-4027", " 800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)"], "title": ["Zika Virus in Samoa"]}, "551": {"sentences": "WHO | Avian influenza \u2013 situation in Turkey  Skip to main content  Access  Home Alt+0  Navigation Alt+1  Content Alt+2  Search  Search the  WHO .int site  Submit  Advanced search  Navigation  Home  Health topics  Data  Media centre  Publications  Countries  Programmes  Governance  About WHO  Language  \u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a  \u4e2d\u6587  English  Fran\u00e7ais  \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439  Espa\u00f1ol  Emergencies preparedness, response  Menu  Home  Ebola outbreak in DRC  Alert and response operations  Diseases  Biorisk reduction  Avian influenza \u2013 situation in Turkey  5 January 2006  The Ministry of Health in Turkey has confirmed its first two cases of human infection with avian influenza caused by the H5 virus subtype. Both cases were fatal.  The first case was a 14-year-old boy from the rural district of Dogubayazit, in the eastern province of Agri, which borders the Islamic Republic of Iran and Armenia. He was hospitalized in Van Province on 1 January and died the same day. The second case was his 15-year-old sister, also hospitalized on 1 January. She died on 5 January.  Earlier this week, Turkish authorities had ruled out avian influenza in these cases based on preliminary test results from samples taken from the nose and throat. Subsequent tests of additional patient specimens taken from the lungs produced positive results. Patient samples were sent today to a WHO collaborating centre in the United Kingdom for further analysis. The samples have now arrived; results are expected within the next days.  Turkish health authorities have informed WHO that, since 1 January, a total of 11 patients (including the two confirmed fatal cases) have been hospitalized in Van Province with symptoms suggesting infection with avian influenza. Most patients are children between the ages of six and fifteen years and all reside in the Dogubayazit district. Two of the children are siblings of the two confirmed cases.  Following a request by the Ministry of Health, an initial team of experts from WHO, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the European Commission is travelling today to Turkey to collaborate with the authorities in their investigation of the situation.  Initial information about the confirmed cases suggests that the children acquired their infection following close contact with chickens. Deaths of chickens are known to have occurred in the Dogubayazit district near the end of last year. Although no poultry outbreak has been officially reported in the district, a confirmed outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza in chickens and ducks was reported on 27 December in the adjacent province of Igdir.  National authorities have informed WHO that Dogubayazit district has been placed under quarantine; no people or animals are allowed to move in or out of the district. Culling operations are currently under way.  The two Turkish cases mark the first confirmed reports of human infection with avian influenza outside East Asia. Since January 2004, a total of 142 human cases of H5N1 infection have been reported in Viet Nam, Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia, and China. The cases in Turkey bring the number of affected countries to six, from which 144 cases have now been reported.  Turkey reported its first outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza in poultry in mid-October of last year. That outbreak, which occurred in the northwestern part of the country, was attributed to contact between domestic poultry and migratory waterfowl. The outbreak in Igdir and other suspected outbreaks in this part of the country are thought to have occurred following introduction of the virus by migratory birds. The region, which has several large lakes, is known to lie along migratory routes.

Examples of achievements  The LID grant provides recipient institutions with a stable source of support. This enables them to do long-term planning, as compared to short-term funding thus avoiding responsive research. It allows for forward-thinking research, driven by locally-determined needs. The LID grant supports:  training in research including the design and implementation of a research project, data management, data analysis, ethics in reproductive health research, communication skills / scientific writing workshops.  equipment such as computers  staff salaries  and expert advice.  Research Project Mentoring  In order to promote integration and linkages between research capacity strengthening and thematic research at HRP, mature institutions that have benefited from long-term institutional grants will be invited to participate in multicountry research conducted by HRP.  Research centres which previously benefitted from research capacity strengthening grants will play a pivotal role in providing support to less experienced centres through a research mentoring grant  Research Training grant and Re-Entry grant  In addition, the HRP multicounty studies and research sites will contribute to secondary research (meta-analysis, systematic reviews) and provide academic opportunities for young scientists.  Competitive Intraregional Research grants (CIR)  Supports multicentre studies which foster scientific collaboration as part of the effort to develop solutions to priority regional reproductive health problems. CIR grants have been established with the aim of facilitating research around a defined theme of regional priority.

Mod.<br><br><strong>AS, edited FMD serotype SAT-2 feared in the south of the Gaza Strip </strong><br> 1. On 12 Jul 2017, a report was received from the Veterinary Services in Gaza addressing the appearance of typical clinical oral signs of FMD in 25 calves out of 70, which had been imported from Israel. All 70 calves had been vaccinated twice against FMD in Israel prior to their transfer to the Gaza Strip. 2. On 13 Jul 2017, sick calves were sampled in 2 farms in Rafah. The samples were received at the FMD Laboratory, Kimron Veterinary Institute, Beit-Dagan on 17 Jul 2017. Upon arrival, they were found not to have been refrigerated during the 4 days between submission and arrival, and some of them were dried-up; their poor quality caused difficulties in laboratory diagnosis. 3. Despite the described difficulties, results are indicative of the presence of FMDV serotype SAT2. 4. According to the report, all the sick calves were slaughtered, and no further disease cases are currently known to be present in the Gaza Strip. Consequently, no additional sampling is possible. 5. To the best of our knowledge, there are no official reports of the outbreak of the disease in Egypt. 6. The veterinary services are examining the various possibilities for dealing with the threat, such as: establishing a vaccinated cordon sanitaire, animal movement restrictions, etc. 7. The vaccine applied currently in Israel does not include SAT-2 antigen. Therefore, the Veterinary Services consider the possibility of self-production of such vaccine or the purchase of available vaccine quantities, though the world reserve of this serotype is limited. When available, additional vaccine doses will be used for reinforcement of the vaccination within the protection zone and as a reserve for the possibility of FMD spread elsewhere within the country, requiring mass vaccinations. 8. Although the clinical signs of the disease by different strains of the virus are generally similar, it is important to remember that the SAT-2 virus strain may cause a disease picture more dramatic than the one experienced in Israel due to the full susceptibility of the local livestock. When an unvaccinated herd is infected, a stormy disease and serious losses may be caused compared to past outbreaks. For many years, most outbreaks in Israel have been caused by FMDV serotype O, affecting vaccinated herds, causing low morbidity. However, high mortality in progeny, particularly in dairy sheep, as well as mortality of adult animals were occasionally seen, with complications such as mastitis. 9. It should be remembered that singular or massive cases of sudden mortalities in progeny of cattle, sheep, goats or pigs might, at times, be the only clinical manifestation of FMD infection. Early detection and notification of such conditions are essential. Early warning of infection or its suspicion, at its very beginning, is essential for the checking of wide outbreaks within and between herds. Veterinary practitioners are requested to provide guidance to breeders, suppliers, service providers and others addressing the hazards of the disease spread, its signs, and the measures required for its prevention and control. 10. Biosafety is of paramount importance; we aim to minimize the damage to trade throughout the country while preventing the introduction and spread of the disease. Therefore, every herd owner must defend his livestock and increase the level of his biosafety according to the type and facilities of the holding, the entry of service vehicles, workers, visitors, the point of loading and unloading of feed, goods and animals, taking into account the proximity of grazing animals. 11. Veterinarians, breeders and all practitioners are encouraged to be alert and report to the regional veterinary offices any suspected illness or unauthorised animal movement. At this time, over-reporting is preferable to lack of reporting. Any suspicion of FMD or unusual morbidity or mortality in the herd should be immediately reported to the director of the closest regional veterinary office. 12. Samples of FMD-suspected material should not be sent independently. Sampling and the delivery of the samples should be carried out only by the trained personnel of the Field Veterinary Services. 13. Your full cooperation and utmost alertness are requested. Sincerely, Dr. Shlomo Garazi Director of the Veterinary Services (acting)  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\.

Strains of FMDV SAT-2 have been circulating in Egypt, according to the Egypt page of the WRLFMD, in the years 1950, 2012, and 2014-2015. In 2012, this strain was recorded for the 1st time in the Gaza strip, most likely introduced by smuggled cattle from Egypt's Sinai peninsula (through illegal tunnels). It did not spread at that time to Israel. According to EUFMD's monthly global report for May 2017, FMDV serotype SAT-2 was last recorded in Egypt during May-June 2016  . The most recent genotyped FMDV SAT-2 strain from Egypt was collected from cattle at Elmahmodia, Somesta, Beni Suef governorate on 26 Jul 2015 and genotyped by WRLFMD (Pirbright) as Topotype: VII, Lineage: Alx-12. The full results of the genotyping, including a dendogram and the most closely related prototype sequences are available at  . The Kimron Veterinary Institute at Beit Dagan constructed in 1999 a High-Containment Biosafety facility for the emergency production of FMD (and other exotic diseases) vaccines. The planning of the facility and its initial equipping were technically and financially supported by the EC; this, in anticipation of its due contribution to regional needs. Since its inauguration, the facility was utilized for various scientific needs and for the experimental production of small quantities of vaccines, but not for the production of significant quantities of vaccines. In the current situation, its activation for its initial end may be a timely achievement. Subscribers may note that FAO's Crisis Management Center-Animal Health (CMC-AH) in collaboration with the FAO West Bank and Gaza Strip office in Jerusalem organized a joint Palestinian-Israeli Good Emergency Management Practice (GEMP) workshop from 16 to 18 Jul 2017 in Jerusalem. \"This workshop was a timely and significant collaboration supporting and strengthening the continuous dialogue required between neighbours,\" says FAO's recent press release. It further states that the workshop was arranged since \"transboundary animal diseases (TADs) know no borders;\" indeed, the timeliness of the workshop is demonstrated by the current event in the Gaza strip (details at  ). It may be assumed that the recent samples from the Gaza strip have been forwarded for confirmation and genotyping to the Pirbright WRLFMD. Results are anticipated with interest. - Mod.AS   .

In a statement, the WHO said 565 041 suspected cases of cholera have been recorded in the country since 27 Apr 2017. According to the WHO statement, the recorded suspected cases were in 22 out of 23 provinces. The UN agency said the highest number of fatalities, 382 cases, was recorded in the northwestern Hajjah province, while in western Yemen's Hudaida province only around 70 000 suspected cases were recorded. Impoverished Yemen has remained in a state of civil war since 2014, when Houthi rebels overran much of the country, including the capital Sanaa. The conflict escalated when Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies launched a massive air campaign in 2015 aimed at reversing Houthi military gains and shoring up Yemen's embattled government. According to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), over 3 million people have fled their homes since the onset of the Yemen conflict, and more than 20 million throughout the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.

The IAV-S Surveillance report for FY 2017 2nd Quarter has been posted to the web and can be viewed at . Some of the key points in the report include: - In FY 2017 Q2, 1931 samples were submitted for IAV-S surveillance from 888 accessions; - H1N2 was the predominant subtype; - over the past 8 quarters, H1N2 predominated in regions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. USDA has been able to extend the funding for this program through the use of both appropriated and emergency funding. Although producers will continue to bear the cost burden of the initial IAV-S screening test (Matrix PCR) USDA will continue to provide funding support to the National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) for further testing of accessions that meet the Matrix PCR CT cutoff values (oral fluids CT less than 20, and nasal swabs and lung CT less than 25). Further testing includes subtyping PCRs, virus isolation, and sequencing of the HA and NA genes. All IAV-S submissions are voluntary and based on clinical case submissions to veterinary diagnostic labs. Thus data are not a statistically representative sampling of the US swine population. Likewise, the information in this report cannot be used to determine regional and/or national incidence, prevalence, or other epidemiological measures, but it may help identify IAV-S trends.

For the said and additional information on Nepal's FMD past records, including genotyping results (though not yet of the newly introduced A/ASIA/G-VII lineage), see  . The identification of the A/ASIA/G-VII lineage in Nepal represents further spread of this virus, which had been evolving in India many years back (\"A/IND/40/2000\", genotyped A/ASIA/G-VII, was collected in 1999). In 2010, this strain was detected in Myanmar.

The investigation into the illness of a boy admitted to the Gunma Prefecture hospital on 14 Aug 2017 led to the deli's contamination. The deli appears to have sold the 1st suspect potato salad on 7-8 Aug 2017, after which 8 Saitama residents reported stomach pains. Others, ages 7 to 12, were treated for diarrhea. The 5 year old has developed the kidney-threatening disease known as a hemolytic uremic syndrome or HUS. The potato salad distribution is apparently limited to the Gunma and Saitama prefectures. Businesses in Ota, Gunma apparently re-sold the bagged potato salad, also after mixing it with ham and apple pieces. Health officials from the Takasaki Municipal government took salad samples for additional testing. The teenage girl and man in his 80s both dined at the suspected restaurant on 30 Jul 2017 and both required hospitalization. Their O157 strain matched bacteria found in the suspended restaurant.  communicated by: ProMED-mail The Gunma and Saitama Prefectures outbreak is now up to 14 cases. It is not clear that the Yokohama cases are related to it. - Mod. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ ", "dates": [" COLI EHEC - JAPAN (04): O157 OUTBREAKS", "Date: Thu 24 Aug 2017", " 24 Aug 2017:", " 23 Aug 2017:", " 25 Aug 2017:", "Date: Fri 25 Aug 2017", "man in his 80s who ate there on [30 Jul 2017]", "Prefecture hospital on [14 Aug 2017] led to the deli's contamination", "2017] after which 8 Saitama residents reported stomach pains", "restaurant on [30 Jul 2017] and both required hospitalization"], "title": "E. coli EHEC - Japan (04): O157, outbreaks "}, "214": {"sentences": "   Mon 17 Jul 2017 5:06 PM EDT Source: Upper Michigan Resource, WLUC edited Houghton city Houghton county could be facing a distemper outbreak in the raccoon population. Canine distemper is clinically similar to rabies. The virus is not contagious to humans. It can spread through the air to skunks, foxes, wolves, and household pets. Houghton city police have received around 30 calls recently of raccoons showing possible signs of distemper. \"Their equilibrium is off, they fall down, and they act like they're not afraid of humans. You might think they look intoxicated. So, if you see any of those signs, call your local police department, call your vet clinic or you can call the DNR Department of Natural Resources,\" says Houghton city police officer Lieutenant Nicholas Roberts. You can protect your pets by keeping them on a leash and up to date on all vaccines. Houghton city police strongly urge everyone to stay away from animals showing signs of distemper. Byline: Mariah Powell  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Canine distemper spilling over into raccoons is a function of relative population densities and thus probable contact. Such outbreaks in raccoons are not uncommon and effectively thin raccoon populations. When we had such an outbreak in Baton Rouge, Louisiana a few years ago it killed 80 percent of the urban raccoons. The real problem is that raccoon rabies can be mistaken for raccoon distemper. So if you see a sick raccoon, call animal control so that they can come out, collect it, and have it tested for rabies. - Mod.MHJ The state of can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at: Houghton county can be seen on the map at: To find Houghton in northern Michigan, go to:   ", "dates": ["Date: Mon 17 Jul 2017 5:06 PM EDT"], "title": "Canine distemper, wildlife - USA (04): (MI) raccoon, susp\r\n\t"}, "573": {"sentences": "OMS | Carreras en la OMS  Ir al contenido principal  Access  Home Alt+0  Navigation Alt+1  Content Alt+2  Buscar  Buscar en WHO.int  Submit  B\u00fasqueda avanzada  Navigation  Acceso  Temas de salud  Datos y estad\u00edsticas  Centro de prensa  Publicaciones  Pa\u00edses  Programas y proyectos  Gobernanza  Acerca de la OMS  Language  \u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a  \u4e2d\u6587  English  Fran\u00e7ais  \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439  Espa\u00f1ol  Men\u00fa de navegaci\u00f3n  Carreras en la OMS  Perfiles que necesitamos  Lo que ofrecemos  Proceso de solicitud  Vacantes - candidatos externos  Vacantes - personal de la OMS  Carreras en la OMS  Proyecte su carrera en la OMS  Los anuncios de puestos vacantes de la OMS est\u00e1n disponibles \u00fanicamente en ingl\u00e9s.

The health department says 5 children became very ill, and 3 have now tested positive for _E. coli_. The aunt says her nephew knows at least one of the other sick boys, and she believes some adults are also being treated. \"They are friends, know each other. So they very well might have been there the same day. But, yeah, the mother's also pregnant, who is also affected, and her son,\" she said. The health department has closed down the beach after water tested there had high levels of fecal coliforms  bacteria that can cause serious illness. There are wastewater treatment plants near the lake, but the county public works department said it didn't find any leaks and the system appears to be working normally. Lake Wildwood is a gated community. When FOX40 tried to speak with the administrative offices, a guard at the gate told us to check back Mon 31 Jul 2017. FOX40 didn't see any swimmers at the lake Sun 30 Jul 2017, but many people were boating and some were fishing. Although it is not specifically stated, a cluster of illness blamed on an _E. coli_ with the development of kidney disease certainly suggests that enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ is at work here, either the prototypic serotype O157:H7 or one of the other Shiga toxin-producing strains. EHEC is most often associated with undercooked ground beef or other contaminated food, the disease can also be transmitted when people drink, or swim in, tainted water. The primary carriers are cattle but can be deer, sheep, goats, other livestock or wild animals or humans. In the spring of 2000, in Walkerton, a town of 5000 in southern Ontario, an outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infection claimed 7 lives  6 adults and a child  and over 200 were seen at local area hospitals.

It is rare in humans. It is unclear what symptoms occurred in the person and how the diagnosis was made. The following appears to be the most recent review of _B. mallei_ infections in humans including the description of disease manifestations: Van Zandt KE, Greer MT, Gelhaus HC. Glanders: an overview of infection in humans. Orphanet J Rare Dis. 2013 Sep 3;8:131. doi: 10.1186/1750-1172-8-131 (the full text and citations can be found at the original URL  ).<br><br><strong> \"Features of human clinical glanders </strong><br> \"General symptoms \"Many forms of glanders have been described, including chronic, disseminated, pulmonary, and septicemic. The variety of infections is largely explained by various routes of infection. Localized infections are generally regionally confined and typically characterized by foci of suppuration. The abscesses can ulcerate and drain for long periods of time. However, localized infections may disseminate, leading to pulmonary, septicemic, or multi-tissue infection 9. The most common clinical features of the eight laboratory-acquired infections from Fort Detrick included (in order of most common occurrence) afternoon to evening low-grade fever, malaise, fatigue, headache, myalgias including backache, lymphadenopathy, and chest pain. Approximately half of the patients not only felt better but were also clinically better for a period of time after the first wave of disease symptoms. This period lasted from a few days to 2 months then patients developed clinical signs of infection. \"Mucosal involvement \"Involvement of the eye and conjunctiva in a _B. mallei_ infection presents with excessive lacrimation and photophobia. Nasal involvement is characterized by inflammation and swelling of the nose, which is common following inhalation of _B. mallei_. This may be followed by copious nasal discharge. Additionally, infection may invade the nasal septum and bony tissues, causing fistulae and tissue destruction 9. The face may swell and regional lymph nodes may become inflamed. Infection may also extend lower in the respiratory tract, resulting in bronchitis which can be accompanied by cough and mucopurulent sputum production. Constitutional signs and symptoms such as fever and chills typically occur within the first few days following infection. Additionally, these symptoms may persist through treatment and be severe. Common signs and symptoms can include, but are not limited to, fever or low-grade fever in the afternoon to evening; chills with or without rigors; and severe headache 9. \"Cutaneous involvement \"Cutaneous manifestations include papular lesions that may erupt anywhere on the body with a more chronic, indolent course of infection. _B. mallei_ entry through an abrasion is typically followed by an inflammatory response, including pain and swelling. In these cases, a glanders node may appear as a single blister, gradually developing into an ulcer that may become hemorrhagic 18,35. A localized infection with a discharge typically develops at the entry site. Inflammation may extend along regional lymphatics and cause lymphangitis with numerous foci of suppuration along their course. The endotoxins present in _B. mallei_ strains affect the smooth muscle of the lymphatics 9 by enhancing the irritation and inflammation seen in the lymphatics. \"Pulmonary involvement \"A pulmonary infection typically results in pneumonia, pulmonary abscess, pleuritis, and plural effusion. Signs and symptoms of pulmonary infection can include cough, dyspnea, chest pain, and mucoplurent sputum. Nonspecific signs and symptoms such as fatigue, fever (often exceeding 102 deg F 38.9 deg C), chills, headache, myalgias, lymphangitis, sore throat, pleuritic chest pain, cough, tachypnea, dyspnea, discharge, and gastrointestinal signs often accompany respiratory infections 9. Many symptoms may take up to 2 to 3 weeks to develop. Nonspecific signs, such as dizziness, rigors, myalgia, nausea, night sweats, severe headache, tachycardia, weight loss, and mucosal eruptions are also usually present and may indicate a disseminated infection 9. \"Dissemination of infection \"Dissemination from local cutaneous or mucosal infection result in septicemia and the colonization of internal organs such as the spleen, liver, and lungs with the development of abscesses 9. Ultrasonography and computed tomography may reveal multiple, small discrete abscesses in both the liver and the kidney 23. These infections are typically associated with septic shock and high mortality.\" This publication describes what seems to have been the last of the cases of human _B. mallei_ in the USA: Srinivasan A, Kraus CN, DeShazer D, et al. Glanders in a military research microbiologist. N Engl J Med. 2001; 345: 256-8; (full text and citations can be found at the original URL \"Infection with _Burkholderia mallei_ (formerly _Pseudomonas mallei_) can cause a subcutaneous infection known as farcy or can disseminate to cause the condition known as glanders. In humans, acute infection with _B. mallei_ is characterized by necrosis of the tracheobronchial tree, pustular skin lesions, and either a febrile pneumonia, if the organism was inhaled, or signs of sepsis and multiple abscesses, if the skin was the portal of entry (1). At the turn of the 20th century, glanders was an important cause of death among horses, and there were secondary, often fatal, infections in humans (2). Because of the lethal and contagious nature of the disease, _B. mallei_ was considered an ideal agent for biologic warfare and was used for this purpose by Germany in World War I (3). \"Aggressive control measures essentially eliminated glanders from the West. However, with the resurgent concern about biologic warfare, _B. mallei_ is now being studied in laboratories worldwide. We describe here the first reported case of human glanders in the USA in more than 50 years and discuss some of the important events in the history of the disease and its initial eradication.<br><br><strong> \"Case report </strong><br> \"In March 2000, tender, left axillary adenopathy and fever (temperature, 38.6 deg C 101.5 deg F) developed in a 33 year old microbiologist at the US Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases who had type 1 diabetes mellitus. The patient had worked for 2 years investigating the basic microbiology of _B. mallei_ and did not routinely wear latex gloves. The adenopathy and fever persisted despite treatment for 10 days with a first-generation cephalosporin. An evaluation after this treatment, which included chest radiography as well as cultures of blood and urine, was unrevealing. During the next few weeks, the patient had increasing fatigue, night sweats, malaise, rigors, and weight loss. \"In early April 2000, his symptoms and adenopathy resolved during a 10-day course of clarithromycin, but he relapsed 4 days after the medication was stopped. On 2 May 2000, he was admitted to his local hospital with diabetic ketoacidosis. A computed tomographic (CT) scan showed multiple hepatic and splenic abscesses. \"On 4 May 2000, respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation developed, and the patient was transferred to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. Physical examination revealed a temperature of 40.3 deg C 104.5 deg F and a heart rate of 122 beats per minute. The patient had a grade 2/6 systolic murmur, coarse breath sounds, and moderate epigastric tenderness. Laboratory studies showed a white-cell count of 8300 per cubic millimeter, with 83 per cent neutrophils, 9 per cent monocytes, and 8 per cent lymphocytes. The hematocrit was 25.6 per cent. The concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were 53 U per liter and 56 U per liter, respectively, and the alkaline phosphatase was 197 IU per liter. Cultures of the patient's blood and a sample from a fine-needle aspiration biopsy of a liver abscess grew a small, bipolar, weakly staining, gram-negative rod that was identified by an automated bacterial-identification system as _Pseudomonas fluorescens_ or _P. putida_. However, gas-liquid chromatography of the cellular fatty acids (Microbial ID, Newark, Del.) placed the organism in the genus _Burkholderia_. Subsequent phenotypic testing and 16S ribosomal RNA gene-sequence analysis identified the organism as _B. mallei_. Initial susceptibility testing showed the isolate to be sensitive to imipenem, ceftazidime, and tetracycline. \"The patient was treated with imipenem and doxycycline, and there was rapid improvement. After two weeks, the imipenem was replaced by azithromycin, and the patient completed a six-month course of treatment with azithromycin and doxycycline. Although the organism was found retrospectively to be relatively resistant to azithromycin, a CT scan obtained after six months of treatment showed substantial improvement of the liver and spleen abscesses, and one year later the patient remained in good health.<br><br><strong> \"Discussion -</strong><br> This is the 1st reported human case of glanders in the English-language medical literature since 1949 (4) and it occurred in the context of research on agents of biologic warfare. \"Glanders may have been the first biologic weapon of the 20th century. During World War I, Germany had a program of biologic sabotage against several countries, including the United States, whereby cultures of _B. mallei_ and anthrax were distributed to undercover agents who attempted to infect livestock that were to be shipped to Allied countries (3). The intention was both the destruction of livestock and the transmission of the highly contagious, lethal agent from livestock to humans. It is currently suspected that attempts are being made to develop an aerosolized form of antibiotic-resistant _B. mallei_ that could become a biologic weapon as potent as anthrax. \"Glanders, an important human and veterinary disease, was eliminated without a vaccine or effective treatment. It appears to have been abolished by the veterinary use of a skin test to detect exposure to B. mallei combined with draconian agricultural measures to control infection (5). \"At the turn of the 20th century, Canada, Britain, and the USA all implemented glanders-control programs. By that time, the symptoms of equine glanders, which include fever and inflammation of the nasal mucosa with ultimate necrosis and obstruction of the oropharynx, had been well described (6). Laws were passed that required notification of the health department and the immediate slaughter of affected animals, with proper disposal of the carcasses. In addition, all horses on the premises where the infected horses were found had to be tested with the mallein skin test for exposure to _B. mallei_; any horses with a reaction also had to be slaughtered. Horses with no reaction were quarantined and then retested two to three weeks later. Furthermore, the equine contacts of the horses were traced to track down other horses that might have been exposed and then moved to other facilities. \"The case we describe illustrates the major clinical features of glanders, which can usually be traced to direct contact with _B. mallei_, as in workers exposed to animals with glanders (7) and in personnel who were exposed in laboratories during World War II (8). Although the patient discussed here could not recall a clear break in his skin or an accident in the laboratory, most reported occupational infections occur without recognized instances of exposure (9). As Robins commented in 1906, \"It is perhaps not advisable to be too dogmatic as to the invariable necessity of an abrasion being present in every case of human glanders . . . as in several such cases of our series it is distinctly stated that there was no abrasion.\" (7). As in our patient, _B. mallei_ often enters the body through the hand or arm. After an incubation period lasting between a few days and several weeks, local suppuration and regional lymphadenopathy occur. Constitutional symptoms often accompany the infection, with fever, rigors, and malaise predominating. If the infection is left untreated, abscesses in the lymph nodes will generally form, then break down and drain. \"Dissemination of the infection occurs 1 to 4 weeks after infection of the lymph nodes. Abscesses can be widespread, and _B. mallei_ can infect almost any tissue (7). Abscesses in the liver and the spleen, as were seen in our patient, appear to be relatively common, as does pulmonary involvement, including consolidation, abscesses, and pleural nodules. The acute onset and rapid resolution of the respiratory failure in our patient were more consistent with the respiratory distress syndrome associated with gram-negative bacteremia than with that associated with pulmonary glanders. Subcutaneous and intramuscular abscesses sometimes develop as well (7). \"There are few data regarding the antibiotic treatment of glanders, since the disease had largely disappeared by the time antibiotics became available. In vitro, ceftazidime, gentamicin, imipenem, doxycycline, and ciprofloxacin all have reliable activity against _B. mallei_ (10), and our patient's infection responded well to a combination of imipenem and doxycycline. Experimentally induced glanders also responds to a combination of sulfazine and trimethoprim (11). However, treatment of the disease in the setting of bioterrorism may be more difficult if the organism is drug-resistant. \"This case demonstrates the difficulties that microbiology laboratories may have in recognizing potential agents of biologic warfare. These microbes are rarely encountered and may be misidentified by conventional, phenotypic identification systems. Techniques such as cellular analysis of fatty acid and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing can be used to identify the organisms correctly, but these tests are not widely available. \"Finally, this case may serve as a harbinger of the resurgence of nearly forgotten diseases such as glanders, plague, smallpox, and anthrax. Research on these diseases is now being conducted in more laboratories, which increases the risk of occupational exposure. There is also the looming threat that some group will eventually mount a successful campaign of bioterrorism. Resources must be allocated both to prevent and to prepare for these frightening possibilities.

OMS  \u201cPor pura casualidad asist\u00ed a una conferencia y escuch\u00e9 la charla de este profesional sanitario; todo lo que cont\u00f3 coincid\u00eda exactamente con lo que me estaba pasando los dos \u00faltimos meses\u201d, dice Boko, que fue diagnosticada posteriormente de hipertensi\u00f3n y diabetes.  El profesional sanitario visit\u00f3 ese d\u00eda el pueblo de Chumey, en el distrito de Bumthang, como parte de un programa apoyado por la OMS y dirigido por el Gobierno Real de Bhut\u00e1n, destinado a frenar la tendencia al aumento de las enfermedades no transmisibles (ENT), principalmente las cardiopat\u00edas y neumopat\u00edas, el c\u00e1ncer y la diabetes en el pa\u00eds.  Estas enfermedades representan el 56% de las muertes en Bhut\u00e1n; sus factores de riesgo, como el consumo nocivo de alcohol, las dietas malsanas, la mala alimentaci\u00f3n con mucha sal y el consumo de tabaco, est\u00e1n profundamente arraigados en las tradiciones culturales del pa\u00eds y, por tanto, plantean un serio problema de cara a una intervenci\u00f3n sanitaria eficaz.  En 2009, el gobierno puso en marcha un proyecto piloto en Bumthang y Paro, 2 de los 20 distritos de Bhut\u00e1n, para introducir el Conjunto OMS de intervenciones esenciales contra las ENT (PEN). El proyecto se ampli\u00f3 a nivel nacional en 2014, y en la actualidad el n\u00famero de pacientes que solicitan consultas m\u00e9dicas alcanza una cifra sin precedentes.  El PEN tiene como objetivo mostrar a los profesionales sanitarios c\u00f3mo detectar y tratar estas enfermedades mediante la detecci\u00f3n de la diabetes, la hipertensi\u00f3n, el sobrepeso y los primeros signos de c\u00e1ncer, y la educaci\u00f3n de la poblaci\u00f3n sobre los factores de riesgo de las ENT en el primer nivel de atenci\u00f3n y por medio de la divulgaci\u00f3n. La iniciativa PEN tambi\u00e9n ofrece orientaciones sobre la derivaci\u00f3n de pacientes que necesitan tratamiento adicional a niveles superiores de atenci\u00f3n.  Boko, de 46 a\u00f1os, peona caminera, pensaba que una dieta de alimentos como el cerdo y la mantequilla era buena para su salud. Al final de la jornada de trabajo, sol\u00eda juntarse con sus amigas para beber \"ara\", una bebida alcoh\u00f3lica elaborada localmente, para recuperarse de la rutina del d\u00eda.  Tambi\u00e9n notaba s\u00edntomas extra\u00f1os, como no poder saciar su sed a pesar de beber agua a menudo, orinar con frecuencia, y perder \u2014en lugar de ganar\u2014 peso, pese a comer mucho, signos caracter\u00edsticos de la diabetes.  Tras su encuentro con el profesional sanitario se le recomend\u00f3 ir de inmediato a un hospital para hacerse un examen, despu\u00e9s del cual se le dijo que ten\u00eda hiperglucemia e hipertensi\u00f3n arterial y fue remitida a un programa de tratamiento, que consist\u00eda en medicaci\u00f3n y una estricta dieta saludable.  \"Ahora s\u00e9 lo que tengo que comer y cu\u00e1nto. Hace tres a\u00f1os pesaba unos 86 kg, y ahora peso solamente 64\", a\u00f1ade con una risita. Desde entonces, Boko ha mantenido su medicaci\u00f3n diaria para controlar la hipertensi\u00f3n y acude regularmente al hospital para que le hagan un seguimiento. Si bien el trabajo de Boko no ha cambiado, s\u00ed que lo ha hecho su modo de vida.  \u201cEs una paciente obediente\", dice el Dr. Chador, director m\u00e9dico del Hospital de Bumthang. \"Nos gustar\u00eda que todos los pacientes fueran como ella; siempre sigue nuestras recomendaciones\u201d.  Carga de enfermedades no transmisibles  Los casos como el de Boko son habituales en Bhut\u00e1n, donde la prevalencia de las ENT ha aumentado considerablemente debido al cambio en los modos de vida, caracterizados por malos h\u00e1bitos alimentarios y la comercializaci\u00f3n de alimentos y bebidas malsanos.  \"La historia de Boko refleja los problemas socioecon\u00f3micos y la exposici\u00f3n a los factores de riesgo de las ENT a que se enfrentan muchas personas en Bhut\u00e1n,\" dice la Dra. Ornella Lincetto, Representante de la OMS en Bhut\u00e1n. \"El Gobierno es consciente de que el aumento de las ENT representa una amenaza tremenda para garantizar la atenci\u00f3n sanitaria gratuita a la poblaci\u00f3n\".  La adopci\u00f3n del PEN por Bhut\u00e1n ha transmitido un mensaje firme de que el gobierno se toma en serio la mejora de la prevenci\u00f3n, detecci\u00f3n y tratamiento de estas enfermedades.  Las cardiopat\u00edas y las mujeres  Las cardiopat\u00edas siguen siendo un problema de salud en las mujeres poco reconocido y poco tratado en todo el mundo. Esto es as\u00ed pese a que las cardiopat\u00edas constituyen la causa principal de muerte entre las mujeres. En el D\u00eda Mundial del Coraz\u00f3n, celebrado el 29 de septiembre de 2015, la OMS pidi\u00f3 a los pa\u00edses que adoptaran medidas para reducir las cardiopat\u00edas entre las mujeres.  \"El PEN ha demostrado que reduce el riesgo de cardiopat\u00edas en un 45%\", dice el Dr. Dorji Wangchuk, Secretario del Ministerio de Salud del Gobierno del Reino de Bhut\u00e1n. \"El Gobierno de Bhut\u00e1n est\u00e1 trabajando activamente para asegurarse de que las mujeres acuden a las cl\u00ednicas y se benefician del PEN\".  El \u00e9xito en la implantaci\u00f3n del PEN en Bhut\u00e1n radica en el hecho de que se ha adaptado a las necesidades locales y al modelo de prestaci\u00f3n de servicios sanitarios del pa\u00eds.

A hospital recorded more infected cases coming from the gold mines in Northern state. The patients are treated in the isolation ward placed outside of the health centre of Abri, a town along the Nile. A source reported to Radio Dabanga also on 7 Aug 2017, that 5 cases are being treated in Wadi Halfa hospital in Northern state, and in El Mahas in Dalgo locality, 5 people suffering from cholera were also reported to the health centre, bringing to the total number of infections the centre has seen to 70. Activist Wael El Imam told Radio Dabanga that the 5 new patients are all miners who work in the traditional gold mining sector in Dalgo. One patient, a miner, succumbed to cholera on Sat 5 Aug 2017, in the hospital where a room has functioned as isolation space since last Thu 3 Aug 2017. People in Delgo (the main town of Dalgo) have continued to call upon the authorities to establish the cholera isolation ward outside of Delgo and in the mining areas, in fear of a growing rate of infections among residents. They threatened to prevent miners from entering Delgo. \"Authorities have not yet responded to them,\" El Imam said. Last week week of 1 Aug 2017, activist Adham Nasir told Radio Dabanga that the hospital in Delgo received 34 new cases of cholera on Thu 3 Aug 2017, raising the total number of infected cases in the ward to 77. Most of the patients are reportedly miners. In Khartoum, First Vice-President and Prime Minister Bakri Hassan Saleh instructed the Ministry of Finance and the Income Allocation and Monitoring Commission to provide financial resources to complement the efforts to combat cholera. Health Minister Bahar Idris Abugarda said in a statement that the total number of cases of 'watery diarrhea' in the country now stands at 123 people. Since the 1st reports of infections in Blue Nile state in September 2016, the Sudanese authorities have refused to make any reference to the disease being cholera, in disagreement with doctors, medical volunteers and civil society initiatives. Yesterday 7 Aug 2017, Abugarda said in a press statement that the containment of cholera is moving quickly as the health teams intensified their efforts to contain the epidemic, with continued monitoring and follow-up efforts. The current health situation is good all over the country, the health minister said, pointing out that schools and educational institutions are well protected.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness. As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea: \"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as \"potentially the most important medical advance\" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5). \"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.<br><br><strong>\" References </strong><br> 1.

TY  communicated by: ProMED-mail and Roland H\u00fcbner Superior Health Council Brussels Belgium The number of reported cases of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection in the Americas appears to have declined this year (2017). Given the outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections in the region, and the clinical similarity of cases of that virus infection and CHIKV infection, one wonders how many cases that were not laboratory confirmed but clinically diagnosed as ZIKV infections were, in reality, CHIKV infections. It is also possible that a significant proportion of the population have been infected by CHIKV in the previous 3 years and are now immune. It seems likely, however, that CHIKV is now endemic in the Americas, and sporadic, small outbreaks may continue to occur as they do in Asia and Africa. - Mod.TY ", "dates": ["18 Aug 2017", "territory - 2017 to EW 33 [week ending 18 Aug 2017]", "Mexico / 31 [4 Aug] / 0 / 21 / 0 / 0", "USA / 32 [11 Aug] / 0 / 0 / 29 / 0", "Costa Rica / 30 [28 Jul] / 256 / 0 / 0 / 0", "El Salvador / 31 [4 Aug] / 381 / 0 / 0 / 0", "Nicaragua / 32 [11 Aug] / 579 / 13 / 0 / 0", "Panama / 30 [28 Jul] / 1570 / 19 / 1 / 0", "Guadeloupe / 30 [28 Jul] / 0 / 11 / 0 / 0", "Martinique / 30 [28 Jul] / 0 / 24 / 0 / 0", "Puerto Rico / 30 [28 Jul] / 0 / 8 / 0 / 0", "Saint Barthelemy / 30 [28 Jul] / 0 / 3 / 0 / 0", "Saint Martin / 30 [28 Jul] / 0 / 3 / 0 / 0", "Bolivia / 32 [11 Aug] / 3177 / 22 / 0 / 0", "Colombia / 31 [4 Aug] / 773 / 4 / 0 / 0", "Peru / 31 [4 Aug] / 853 / 569 / 0 / 0", "Brazil / 25 [23 Jun] / 65 173 / 66 578 / 0 / 51", "Paraguay / 30 [28 Jul] / 739 / 5 / 0 / 0", "Totals (all of 2017) / 73 943 / 67 483 / 32 / 51", " 26 Jun 2017", " 5 Aug 2017", " 13 Aug 2017", " November 2016-May 2017 (conf)", " 8 Jul 2017", " (conf) 571 cases; 65 municipalities", " 25 Jul 2017", " (conf) 60 000 cases 80 per cent of towns", " 29 Jul 2017", " 15 Aug 2017", " 28 Jun 2017", " 14 Aug 2017", " 30 Jun 2017", " 14 Jul 2017", " 6 Aug 2017", " 4 Aug 2017", "chikungunya last [Thu 3 Aug 2017]", " 30 Jul 2017", " 17 Jul 2017"], "title": "Chikungunya (27) - Americas, Europe, Asia "}, "632": {"sentences": "OMS | Action sanitaire \u00e0 vis\u00e9e humanitaire  Aller au contenu principal  Access  Home Alt+0  Navigation Alt+1  Content Alt+2  Chercher  Rechercher sur WHO.int  Submit  Recherche avanc\u00e9e  Navigation  Page d'accueil  Th&egrave;mes de sant&eacute;  Donn&eacute;es et statistiques  Centre des m&eacute;dias  Publications  Pays  Programmes et projets  Gouvernance  &Agrave; propos de l'  OMS  Language  \u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a  \u4e2d\u6587  English  Fran\u00e7ais  \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439  Espa\u00f1ol  Action de sant\u00e9 \u00e0 vis\u00e9e humanitaire  Rubriques  Action de sant\u00e9 \u00e0 vis\u00e9e humanitaire  Principaux documents politiques  Crises  Publications Le chol\u00e9ra touche d\u00e9sormais 500 000 personnes au Y\u00e9men  OMS  14 ao\u00fbt 2017  Le nombre total de cas pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s de chol\u00e9ra a franchi le cap des 500 000 dimanche au Y\u00e9men.

A 39-year-old Korean man was confirmed to have been infected with the waterborne bacterium after visiting the Philippines, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). He is now receiving treatment at a hospital and remains in a stable condition, the KCDC said. Earlier, South Korea reported 3 cholera patients in the latest outbreak of the disease. All 3 have contracted the disease after traveling abroad. The diarrheal disease, which is curable with proper medication and treatment, annually affects 3 million to 5 million people and claims more than 100 000 lives throughout the world.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness. As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea: \"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as \"potentially the most important medical advance\" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5). \"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.<br><br><strong>\" References </strong><br> 1.

Yesterday 22 Aug 2017, an activist from the emergency room of Teiba El Ahamda told Radio Dabanga that El Ezba district health center has recorded 4 cases of cholera during the past 2 days. The activist attributed the emergence of cases to the rainfall and the terrible environmental degradation witnessed by the district due to the accumulation of waste. He pointed out that Bahri locality has stopped transporting the waste from Teiba El Ahamda for unknown reasons for 3 years. El Azhari Widaatallah, the chairman of the Legislative and Justice Committee of the Parliament, representative of Constituency 30 of Khartoum state of the districts of El Azhari, El Shajara, El Azozab, Lamab, Hamadab, pointed to the emergence of watery diarrhea in his constituency, especially at El Shajara. He attributed the deterioration of the health situation in the area to the lack of sewage system and the stagnation of rainwater. Health sources revealed the emergence of a number of cases of cholera in the academic hospital in Khartoum.<br><br><strong> Northern state </strong><br> In the Northern state, the isolation centre at Delgo Hospital received 3 new cases of cholera on Sun 20 Aug 2017. Nubian activist Ashraf Abdelwedoud warned in an interview with Radio Dabanga of the increasing rates of the disease following the rains and floods in the area in the past few days. He called on the authorities to make efforts to curb the spread of the disease. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness. As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea: \"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per cent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as \"potentially the most important medical advance\" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5). \"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.<br><br><strong> \"References </strong><br> 1.

The outbreak investigation is ongoing. It has been challenging because of the long incubation period of the disease (15 to 50 days) and the difficulty experienced to contact many individuals sickened with the illness who are homeless and/or illicit drug users. To date, no common source of food, beverage, or other cause has been identified; as a result, the source of the outbreak remains undetermined. Vaccination efforts are being implemented in targeted locations by county staff and in collaboration with health care partners. Health providers are asked to inform the Epidemiology Program if they have a patient suspected to have the hepatitis A infection before the patient leaves the emergency department or provider's office (see contact number below). The table below will provide a weekly update of total cases, deaths, and hospitalizations. Following this update is information about hepatitis A to educate the community and help prevent the continual spread of this viral infection.<br><br><strong> San Diego County Hepatitis A Outbreak Cases and Deaths as of 25 Jul 2017 -</strong><br> Cases / Deaths / Hospitalizations 275 / 7 / 194 (71%) Please note: Table does not include all reported hepatitis A cases in the county, only those that are local-outbreak-related. Also, data are provisional and subject to change.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\.

Since many cases of HAV infection are asymptomatic or anicteric (without jaundice), the total number of cases is likely to have been significantly higher. It is not clear whether the newer cases are truly new or just newly reported older cases. An epidemiologic curve showing the date of onset of symptoms of cases over time could assist in this regard. Thus, it remains unclear whether the persistent increase is related to slow reporting, increased awareness and testing, secondary cases, or the persistent source or sources in the environment. The very high hospitalization rate may be related to the homelessness of the cohort but could represent a more virulent strain. HAV infection occurred in some individuals chronically infected with either hepatitis B or C, but it is not clear whether the fatalities occurred in those individuals. Homelessness and illicit substance use seem to be relevant risk factors, while homosexual practices are not. It remains unclear how and from what vehicle the virus is spreading. - Mod.LL   .

The IBTS said the infection occurred after the blood donation was made in the \"window period\" when the virus cannot be detected, even by the most sensitive tests available. The case is \"not an ongoing patient safety incident\" and could not be attributed to a testing failure, according to Minister for Health Simon Harris. \"This is a very rare situation which the IBTS is dealing with in a sensitive manner with the patient impacted.\" Dr Stephen Field, IBTS medical and scientific director, described the incident as a \"rare, one in 2 million event\" with no implications for blood that will be transfused to patients in the future. He said the IBTS has tested 1.2 million donations to date and \"there has been no other confirmed transfusion transmitted infection of hepatitis B.\" It is possible for infected blood to pass as negative for a period of about 15 days, according to Dr Field. Similar cases have arisen in the UK and other countries. The donated blood tested negative for the presence of hepatitis B before the transfusion, as the virus was not picked up by the screening equipment used. The IBTS said the incident \"represents a donation made in the window period when the presence of the virus cannot be consistently detected even by the most sensitive tests available.\" The red blood cells from the donation were transfused into a patient during a medical procedure, which resulted in the patient later contracting hepatitis B  a virus that infects the liver. The Health Service Executive became aware of the issue when the original blood donor tested positive for the Hepatitis B virus, and the IBTS was informed. The blood transfusion service then carried out a follow up test of an archived sample taken from the blood donor, using the same method and the blood sample came back negative for the presence of hepatitis B. Following an additional DNA test of the sample results came back positive for the hepatitis B virus. The IBTS said the patient is being managed appropriately by a medical team. Most people with normal immune systems will clear the virus, but those infected early in life are more likely to develop chronic infection. Hepatitis B virus is transmitted through exposure to infected blood and body fluids such as semen and vaginal secretions. The most common routes of transmission relate to close contact (such as sexual, mother to child, household) with an infected individual, sharing of needles for injecting drug use, or exposure to the virus in a healthcare setting. Byline: Jack Power, Paul Cullen  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. What is likely being described here is a red blood cell transfusion obtained from an asymptomatic patient with hepatitis B during the \"window period\" when the standard screening test (hepatitis B surface antigen) has waned to undetectable levels but before anti-HBs (hepatitis B surface antibody) has developed. Blood transfused during this period can be infectious. ProMED would appreciate knowing if even in retrospect, the blood was positive for IgM anti-HBc (IgM antibody against hepatitis B core antigen) which, short of the HBV DNA assay, is the only HBV marker found during this period. There is an earlier \"window period\" which occurs before HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen) is detectable in the blood and while the patient is always asymptomatic but less information is available regarding infectivity at that stage. The WHO publication \"Screening Donated Blood for Transfusion Transmissible Infections\" published in 2010 (text and references available at  ) discusses the screening of blood for transfusion for hepatitis B: \"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a member of the hepadnavirus group and is an enveloped DNA virus. HBV is transmissible by the parenteral route and may be found in blood and other body fluids. Once in the bloodstream, the virus travels to the liver where it replicates in hepatocytes. HBV is endemic globally and hyper-endemic in parts of the world. It is difficult to determine the total number of cases of transfusion-transmitted HBV globally. Transmissibility: While HBV is present in the bloodstream, the levels of the virus itself are variable. In recently infected individuals, viral DNA is normally present, although not always at high levels. Chronically infected individuals may either be infectious (viral DNA present) or non-infectious (viral DNA absent) and viremia would generally be expected to be very low or absent entirely. Screening for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) indicates infection with HBV, but does not in itself distinguish between recent and chronic infections. The distinction between acute and chronic infection is not relevant to blood screening; all HBsAg positive donations should be considered to be at high risk of transmitting HBV and should not be released for transfusion. Additionally, some studies indicate that even when HBsAg is negative, some individuals may have low levels of detectable viral DNA which will be transmitted by blood and may cause infection in the recipient. The use of unscreened HBV-infected blood and blood products will result in the transmission of HBV in the vast majority of cases. In general, the earlier in life that HBV is acquired, the more likely the individual is to develop chronic infection which then has a higher probability of progressing to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Screening: The serology of HBV is complex. A number of different serological markers develop during the course of infection, including hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc). In addition, HBV DNA can be detected in the majority of cases, although in HBsAg negative phases of infection the DNA levels are generally relatively low and the viremia may be transient. The methods used to identify the presence of HBV employ the following screening targets: Serological markers: - Hepatitis B surface antigen - Hepatitis B core antibody, in some situations Viral nucleic acid: HBV DNA. Hepatitis B surface antigen: Hepatitis B surface antigen is the prime marker used in blood screening programs. It normally appears within three weeks after the first appearance of HBV DNA and levels rise rapidly. It can thus be detected easily by most of the highly sensitive HBsAg assays available. The presence of HBsAg may indicate current or chronic infection and thus potential infectivity. Most blood transfusion services screen donated blood for HBsAg using sensitive immunoassays. Particle agglutination assays are still available and used in some countries, although they are less sensitive than immunoassays or even simple/rapid assays. Hepatitis B core antibody: Antibody to hepatitis B core antigen is produced later in acute infection, after the appearance of HBsAg, and marks the start of the immune response to HBV infection. In general, anti-HBc persists for life, irrespective of whether the infection resolves or progresses to chronicity. In the vast majority of cases of hepatitis B, the detection of anti-HBc has limited value as HBsAg is already present. In some cases, however, during the resolution of the infection, HBsAg may decline to below detectable levels. Although anti-HBs usually then appears relatively rapidly, there may be a short period of time prior to its appearance when anti-HBc is the only detectable circulating serological marker of infection, even though the individual may still have low viremia and would thus be potentially infectious the classical HBV \"window period.\" - Mod.LL If anti-HBc screening is introduced for routine use, it would be necessary to distinguish between individuals who are anti-HBc reactive because of previous, resolved, natural HBV infection, and are thus non-infectious, from those who have unresolved HBV infection and are thus potentially infectious. In a population with a high prevalence of infection, the number of blood donors with evidence of natural, resolved infection is likely to be significant, resulting in the potentially unnecessary discard of many blood donations. As the presence of anti-HBs is protective, anti-HBs testing of all anti-HBc reactive donations would therefore be required to distinguish between infectious and non-infectious individuals. In general, a level of anti-HBs at 100 mIU/mL is usually accepted as the minimum protective level in the context of blood screening; donations that are HBsAg negative, anti-HBc reactive with anti-HBs levels of 100 mIU/mL or more are generally considered to be safe and acceptable for release for clinical or manufacturing use. Another important consideration is that anti-HBc assays often demonstrate a high level of non-specificity. This, together with the problems associated with the confirmation of anti-HBc reactivity, often results in a situation where anti-HBc reactivity is identified in the absence of any other markers of HBV infection and where the majority of this reactivity is actually non-specific and does not reflect HBV infection. Thus, although anti-HBc screening may have advantages in some situations, the problems associated with the performance of anti-HBc assays and the complexity of dealing with HBV immune individuals may outweigh any potential benefits. Alanine aminotransferase: Testing for raised liver alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels was originally introduced in some countries prior to the identification of hepatitis C and the introduction of HCV screening in an attempt to reduce the incidence of what was then called post-transfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis (PTNANBH). ALT is an enzyme found predominantly in the liver. It circulates naturally at low levels in the bloodstream, but is released in high quantities as a result of liver damage; this is often, but not exclusively, due to viral infection. ALT is a non-specific marker of infection. With the advent of HCV screening, screening for raised ALT levels provides no identifiable benefit in terms of improving blood safety. Hepatitis B virus DNA: The detection of HBV DNA further reduces the risk of HBV transmission through the transfusion of infected blood donated during the acute window period: that is, when the results of HBsAg assays are negative, but HBV DNA is positive. Low levels of HBV DNA have also been detected in the blood of individuals after the resolution of acute HBV infection and the disappearance of HBsAg or in so-called chronic occult HBV infection.<br><br><strong> Recommendations -</strong><br> To minimize the risk of HBV infection through the route of transfusion: 1. Screening should be performed using a highly sensitive and specific HBsAg immunoassay (EIA/CLIA enzyme immunoassay/chemiluminescent immunoassays). 2. Screening using a highly sensitive and specific HBsAg rapid assay or particle agglutination assay may be performed in laboratories with small throughput, in remote areas or in emergency situations. 3. Screening for anti-HBc is not recommended as a routine. Countries should determine the need for anti-HBc screening based on the prevalence and incidence of HBV infection. 4. Screening for ALT is not recommended.\" - Mod.LL   .

CDFA continually monitors and investigates equine neurologic cases for the presence of WNV in California,\" the statement continued. \"CDFA urges horse owners to consult their veterinarian concerning a WNV vaccination program to ensure maximum protection of their horses.\" West Nile is transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs for WNV include flulike signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed; fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculation; hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound); changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they are daydreaming or \"just not with it\"; occasional somnolence (drowsiness); propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control); and \"spinal\" signs, including asymmetrical weakness. Some horses show asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia. Equine mortality rate can be as high as 30-40 percent. Horse owners should also consult their private practicing veterinarian to determine an appropriate disease prevention plan for their horses. Vaccines have proven to be a very effective prevention tool. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the two-shot vaccination series within a 3- to 6-week period. In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and using mosquito repellents.

The patient is an injection drug user and the suspected source of infection is either a soiled skin injection site, contaminated injection devices or contaminated heroin. The man is currently hospitalized. In 2016, NMDOH identified 3 confirmed and one probable wound botulism cases among people who inject drugs. Botulism is a rare, but potentially deadly illness caused by a nerve toxin that induces paralysis. Wound botulism is caused by the toxin produced from a wound infected with bacterium called _Clostridium botulinum_. \"We are asking healthcare providers to carefully consider wound botulism in patients who are showing symptoms, especially if they have a history of injection drug use,\" said Secretary of Health Lynn Gallagher.

With black tar the product's processing stops immediately after acetylation. Its unique consistency however is due to acetylation without a reflux apparatus. As in Homebake Heroin in Australia and New Zealand the crude acetylation results in a gooey mass. Black tar as a type holds a variable admixture of morphine derivativespredominantly 6-MAM (6-monoacetylmorphine) which is another result of crude acetylation. The lack of proper reflux during acetylation fails to remove much of the moisture retained in the acetylating agent, glacial acetic acid. \"Black tar heroin is often produced in Latin America, and is most commonly found in the western and southern parts of the USA, while also being occasionally found in western Canada and Europe. It has a varying consistency depending on manufacturing methods, cutting agents, and moisture levels, ranging in quality from a black-brown tarry goo in unrefined form to a uniform, light-brown powder when further processed and cut with lactose. \"People who intravenously inject black tar heroin are at higher risk of venous sclerosis than that inject powder heroin. In this condition, the veins narrow and harden, which makes repeated injection there nearly impossible. Researchers at UC-San Francisco have found that the rapidity with which black tar heroin destroys veins, along with its gummier consistency, may put people who inject it at a lower risk of HIV infection because they may be forced to inject subcutaneously (rather than into veins), and needles must be thoroughly rinsed free of 'black tar' between injections if new sterilized ones are not available. \"The presence of 6-monoacetylcodeine found in tar heroin has not been tested in humans but has been shown to be toxic alone and more toxic when mixed with mono- or di- acetyl morphine potentially making tar more toxic than refined diamorphine. At least 1 study has drawn attention to lower rates of HIV infection amongst drug injectors in which black tar heroin is the major form of street-available heroin, suggesting that this may be due to the need to heat black tar heroin to dissolve it (which also inactivates any HIV present in the solution). \"However, black tar heroin injectors can be at increased risk of life-threatening bacterial infections, in particular necrotizing soft tissue infection. The practice of \"skin-popping\" or subcutaneous injection predisposes to necrotizing fasciitis or necrotizing cellulitis from _Clostridium perfringens_, while deep intramuscular injection predisposes to necrotizing myositis. Tar heroin injection can also be associated with _Clostridium botulinum_ infection.\" - Mod.LL   .

For this current outbreak, reported along the border area in the county of Cucuta with Venezuela, the animals showing clinical signs were detected at the border control point of ICA (point of entry). The finding of suspect animals at this point of entry shows the efforts being done by the Colombian Veterinary Authorities to detect the disease early and contain its spread. - Mod CRD The animals originated from a farm located in the county of San Faustino, which is about 300 meters from the border with Venezuela. Customs Police noted that San Faustino serves as a smuggling corridor for many types of goods including animals. Furthermore, they noted that many farms straddle both Colombian and Venezuelan territory, making it easy for animals to move between the countries. A determination was made that the case in Tibacuy was epidemiologically linked with the case in Yacopi, and that fomites were the most likely source of transmission. In both cases, ICA triggered their emergency response activities and quarantined both premises upon suspicion of the disease. At the following link (link is in Spanish), you can find information on the activities being done by ICA to eradicate FMD.

Of the total number of cases recorded, 60 percent were diagnosed in 4 communes (El-M'ghair, Reguiba, Oum-Toyour and Still) considered as foci of this disease, due to high amount of livestock, goats and cattle in particular, said the APS doctor at the prevention department Kamel Dif. The highest number of cases of brucellosis is generally recorded during the spring period (March, April and May), characterized by high consumption of raw milk, especially in pastoral areas . An extensive awareness program on the fight against this disease was launched in 2017 by the health sector targeting breeders, as well as producers and consumers of raw milk, according to this official. The aim of this awareness-raising action is to anchor the culture of prevention among consumers of raw milk, he said. Brucellosis vaccination partners are also being led by the Agricultural Services Directorate (DSA) to protect livestock against this zoonosis.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail This infection, a bacterial zoonosis, is classified among the category B biowarfare agents. Natural transmission to humans occurs after occupational exposure or through ingestion of contaminated food products. Although brucellosis has become a rare entity in the United States and many industrialized nations because of animal vaccination programs, this condition remains a significant health problem in many developing countries. Each species of _Brucella_ has a specific animal reservoir in which chronic disease is present. The bacilli tend to localize in the reproductive organs of the animals, causing sterility and abortions, and are shed in large numbers in the animal's urine, milk, and placental fluid. This localization allows for efficient spread to farmers, veterinarians, slaughterhouse workers, and consumers. Among the 4 species known to cause disease in humans, _Brucella melitensis_ (from goats, sheep, or camels) may be the most virulent, producing the most severe and acute cases of brucellosis with disabling complications. A prolonged course of illness, which may be associated with suppurative destructive lesions, is associated with _B. suis_ (from feral or commercially raised pigs) infection. _B. abortus_ (from cattle, buffalo, and camels) is associated with mild-to-moderate sporadic disease that is rarely associated with complications. In the Maghreb and the Middle East, human brucellosis is usually contracted through consumption of raw goat / ewe's milk or local artisanal cheese made from the raw milk and _Brucella melitensis_ is responsible for the great majority of the reported cases, with a marked predominance of its biovar 3, as in other Mediterranean countries. El Oued Province lies in the Sahara desert in northeast Algeria.

Infected ticks transmit the Powassan (POW) virus to people. Many POW infected people do not develop any symptoms; but those who do develop symptoms, often include fever, headache, loss of coordination, and seizures. The POW virus infection can lead to more severe symptoms including swelling of the brain and spinal cord and in a few cases, death does occur. The POW virus is rare with only 26 cases seen in New York from 2004-2016. \"There has never been a documented case of Powassan virus in Schuyler county or any of the western region of NYS New York state, but we remain alert to its presence in the state and are working with local health care providers to monitor our community,\" said Schuyler county Public Health Director, Marcia Kasprzyk. Prevention is key. The best protection from POW virus and all tick related diseases, like Lyme, is to eliminate your exposure to ticks. Protection includes applying a DEET repellant before spending time outdoors, wearing long-sleeved, light colored, breathable clothing and tucking your pants into your socks, and staying on trails to avoid brush and leaves. When you come in from outdoors it is important to shower and check for ticks on your body and clothing. The Powassan virus is primarily seen in the northeastern part of the United States. New York, Minnesota, and Wisconsin have seen the highest number of cases.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\.org/post/20170721.5193574). The case count is now up to 3. Although cases in New York are not common, they do occur sporadically. Saratoga county is located in the upper Hudson River Valley. It would not be surprising if additional cases occur there this summer and autumn. Residents in the area would be prudent to adopt the preventive measures to avoid tick bites mentioned in the report above. - Mod. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ ", "dates": ["Date: Tue 25 Jul 2017", "2004-2016", "[The 18 Jul 2017 post on POW virus infection in the upper Hudson", "org/post/20170721", "5193574)"], "title": "Powassan virus encephalitis - USA (08): USA (NY) "}, "102": {"sentences": " Magill Partners GeoSentinel Global TravEpiNet Mobile Apps RSS Feeds  Zika Virus in Guinea-Bissau  Recommend on Facebook  Tweet  Share Compartir  Warning - Level 3, Avoid Nonessential Travel  Alert - Level 2, Practice Enhanced Precautions  Watch - Level 1, Practice Usual Precautions  Language:  Select  Espa&ntilde;ol  What is the current situation?  Zika virus (or Zika) has been reported in Guinea-Bissau. Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in Guinea-Bissau are infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:  Women who are pregnant:  Do not travel to Guinea-Bissau.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to Guinea-Bissau or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers considering pregnancy:  Before you or your partner travel, talk to your health care provider about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection.  Wait before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.  If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex &ndash; or do not have sex &ndash; for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex, or do not have sex, for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy  Talk to your health care provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you&rsquo;re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Wait at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  Men are advised to wait longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.gov  Contact CDC  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  1600 Clifton Road  Atlanta ,  GA  30329-4027  USA  800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)  Contact CDC-INFO  TOP", "dates": [" Page created: March 10 2017", " Page last updated: August 08 2017", " Page last reviewed: August 08 2017", " 30329-4027", " 800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)"], "title": ["Zika Virus in Guinea-Bissau"]}, "185": {"sentences": "   Tue 22 Aug 2017 3:31 PM CEST Source: KTIV TV, Associated Press (AP) report edited Anthrax is blamed for recent deaths in a cattle herd in south eastern Pennington County. South Dakota state veterinarian Dustin Oedekoven says at least 9 adult cattle died suddenly last week week of 14 Aug 2017 in the herd. The herd had not been vaccinated against anthrax. Anthrax spores survive indefinitely in contaminated alkaline soils. Nearly all parts of South Dakota have the potential for an anthrax outbreak under ideal climatic conditions. Drought, floods and wind can expose grazing livestock to anthrax spores. Livestock producers are advised that anthrax should be suspected in cases of sudden death. Suspected cases should be reported immediately to a local veterinarian or to the state veterinarian at the South Dakota Animal Industry Board. Anthrax can be transmitted to people and other animals.  communicated by: ProMED-mail Pennington County is not in south eastern South Dakota, but on the western border of the state, a part of the state where anthrax is infrequent. It is commoner in eastern South Dakota. This probably explains why these cattle were not vaccinated in spite of the very active extension program fostering anthrax vaccination. Also lack of experience with this disease will delay informing one's veterinarian on the 1st death. Delay results in further cases and deaths.

This was confirmed upon receipt of laboratory results from test samples that were sent to Australia. Agriculture officials were quick to assure, however, that the strain is slow to spread and causes few deaths. \"The rate of transmission is very, very low,\" Arlene Vytiaco, who heads animal disease control in the Bureau of Animal Industry, said in a press briefing on Thursday. She explained that countries like Japan and Myamnar have been affected by H5N6 but have reported no humans infected by the avian influenza. \"The mortality rate is also low,\" Vytiaco said. Since H5N6 started in 2014, only 20 deaths have been reported worldwide. The Department of Health has been conducting regular check-ups on farmers and workers in areas hit by the bird flu outbreak. Vytiaco said no new patients have been admitted since 2 farm workers reported flu-like symptoms last week week of Sun 13 Aug 2017 but eventually tested negative for bird flu. The government had been waiting to see what the bird flu's specific N strain was - particularly on the lookout for the N1 and N6 strains, which can be passed on to humans. Local tests had confirmed it was not the far deadlier H5N1 virus. However, it had to send samples to Australia to check whether it was H5N6, since the government did not have its own test kits here. This was said by Dr Arlene Vytiaco, who oversees disease control for the Bureau of Animal Industry. Reports of bird flu being present were 1st reported earlier this month August 2017. The virus was found in birds from 7 farms in San Luis, Pampanga. The Department of Agriculture DA earlier said the virus had been present since April 2017, but was only reported in August 2017 after 37 000 birds had died. It added the strain of avian flu present in these birds was not transmissible to humans. On Sun 13 Aug 2017, agriculture secretary Manny Pi\u00f1ol said another round of tests was under way to determine whether H5N6  the strain of the virus that can be passed on to humans  was present.

Septoria tritici blotch has built up to levels that could cause significant damage this year 2017. Agriculture Victoria cereal pathologist Grant Hollaway said septoria is now the major fungal disease issue in south-west Victoria. \"It has really emerged as a problem over the past five or six years.\" He said the major threat would be in the medium rainfall zone where the disease had not been spotted for many years. \"Septoria was common in the Wimmera in low levels last year 2016 and this has provided the carryover inoculum.\" There are parallels in septoria's reappearance after a lengthy absence with that of stripe rust, which Dr Hollaway said returned to Victoria in 2003 following a 20 year hiatus. \"It is more of a stripe rust in terms of the damage it can cause,\" he said. Byline: Gregor Heard  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Septoria leaf blotch of cereals is caused by fungi in the septoria species complex, which includes _Zymoseptoria tritici_ (previously _Septoria tritici_), _Mycosphaerella graminicola_ and _Phaeosphaeria nodorum_ (previously _Stagonospora nodorum_). They affect mainly wheat, but also barley and oats and occasionally rye and some grass species. Symptoms on wheat and barley are very similar and may occur at any time during the growth cycle and on any portion of the plant. They include blotches on both leaves and glumes, which reduce the photosynthetic ability of the host. Disease development is favoured by humid conditions. Up to 50 per cent yield losses have been reported on susceptible varieties. Spores can be spread by infected plant material, wind, water (rain splash) and mechanical means. The pathogens can overwinter on crop debris and on autumn sown crops or volunteers. Disease management includes fungicide treatments aimed at preventing the disease becoming established on the upper 3 leaves of the crop canopy (where it would affect the ears most), removal of inoculum sources and use of resistant varieties. After the cereal rusts, the disease is considered the most important challenge to plant breeders (see ProMED-mail post http://promedmail.org/post/20120831.1274190) and a threat to food security worldwide. Pathogen strains with high levels of resistance to many fungicides are emerging, for example, in the UK and other parts of Europe (ProMED-mail post http://promedmail.org/post/20160516.4225677), as well as Australia and New Zealand (ProMED-mail posts http://promedmail.org/post/20161031.4598540, http://promedmail.org/post/20140417.2410219). In Australia, STB was reported as the 1st wheat disease developing fungicide resistance on that continent (ProMED-mail post http://promedmail.org/post/20140313.2329774). The possibility cannot be excluded that the re-emergence of STB in eastern Australia may be due to new fungal strains which have adapted to local conditions. Stripe rust (_Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_), also mentioned above, can result in yield losses of 40 to 100 per cent. New strains with increased virulence are emerging and this disease is currently causing the most damage to wheat crops on a global scale.

According to health officials, the 56-year-old, of Jasper County, Texas, experienced a severe infection after consuming the oysters, which were contaminated with a bacterium called _Vibrio_, CBS Dallas-Fort Worth reports. _Vibrio_ is found in coastal waters, especially warmer areas where oysters live. Authorities say the woman's legs and an arm were subsequently amputated in an effort to cure the infection, but it wasn't enough. \"If you get typical food poisoning with vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, and you've had raw oysters, you ought to consider this infection,\" said Dr David Winter. \"If you've got those symptoms, you need to get to the emergency room right away and get treated.\" Some people only get the food poisoning symptoms with some forms of vibrio gastroenteritis. According to Winter, it's best to eat oysters fried, not raw.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail It is not stated if the woman had an underlying chronic disease but it is likely that she did and that the organism was _V. vulnificus_. The following is extracted from the \"Bad Bug Book,\" Center for Safety and Applied Nutrition, US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) at  : \"_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in salt water, and acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not imply that the water is contaminated by sewage. \"Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc., followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis.\" The \"primary septicemia\" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 percent). Over 70 percent of infected individuals have distinctive bullous skin lesions (shown at  ). There are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination) and that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just get gastroenteritis. It is not clear that the woman in this post had any well defined risk factors.

The children, who were from a rural community in the Dinajpur District in northern Bangladesh, had all experienced acute encephalitis syndrome or AES - a condition associated with fatal inflammation of the brain. Fourteen children became ill between 31 May and 30 June 2012 and only one survived. All the deaths occurred within 20 hours of the onset of symptoms and were linked to exposure to the litchi fruit, which is cultivated across South Asia. Similar deaths were recorded in Muzaffarpur, a district in Bihar, India. Analyses of those cases indicated that toxic compounds in the litchi fruit trigger low blood glucose levels in malnourished children who skipped evening meals leading to death. However, a team of researchers from the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research and the Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research in Bangladesh, and from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Center for Innovation in Global Health in the United States have looked into the Bangladesh litchi deaths and found that the AES was probably triggered by excessive and improper applications of insecticides and other agriculture chemicals in local fruit orchards. The researchers pointed out that the litchi seeds were not eaten and if the seeds were the cause, then there would have been cases scattered across the country and not just in a certain small area. The scientists discovered that the 2012 outbreak occurred during harvest time and growers were applying endosulfan in the orchards, a highly toxic insecticide that has been banned in more than 80 countries. In 2016, Bangladesh was one of several countries, including India and the United States, that still allowed restricted use of endosulfan. Local residents told the investigators it was common for children to play in the orchards and to eat fruit that had fallen on the ground without washing it, using their teeth to peel the tough skin. Moreover, several of the victims had family members who worked in the orchards and this could have increased exposures to insecticides through residues on clothing worn into the home. The research team collected physical evidence from the orchards, which included discarded containers of insecticides and other chemicals. They interviewed residents to find multiple chemicals were applied to the fruit and in amounts far greater than are normally used by other lychee producers. The study also found evidence that the lychee growers were applying an insecticide that had been approved only for use in cotton, not food crops. The findings were published in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. The scientists plan to conduct follow-up studies to get more biological evidence liver and brain biopsies of the victims.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. ProMED-mail posted the original article regarding this situation in 2012 as Undiagnosed deaths - Bangladesh: (RP), pesticide susp., RFI Archive Number: http://promedmail.org/post/20120629.1184443. The original article specified that pesticides were a possibility, and not the fruit. However, the pesticide was not identified at the time of the original article. We would like to point out this article is directly related to the 2012 incident, so this situation is apparently not occurring now, or has not been reported again since that time. Endosulfan, a commercial product of 2 isomers, is a chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticide. As such, it may be used as wood preservative, but is also a contact poison for many insects and mites. Therefore it has been used on food crops, such as vegetables, grains, fruits and teas to rid these crops of damaging pests. Endosulfan is a highly toxic substance whose toxicity is partly dependent upon how the pesticide is applied. The body absorption is rapid in the presence of alcohols, oils or other emulsifiers (on the skin or in the preparation), but otherwise is slowly and incompletely absorbed by the body. Generally endoslfan appears to affect the central nervous system. Acute symptoms include incoordination, agitation, convulstion and even loss of consciousness. Other symptoms include vomiting, and diarrhea. In cattle grazing fields sprayed with endosulfan blindness has been documented. Furthermore, these animals may recover when removed from the exposure and given time, perhaps of a month or more. Likewise sheep and pigs grazing on treated fields have been reported with incoordination and blindness Chronic toxicities may affect kidneys, liver, blood chemistry and the parathyroid gland. There may be other chronic effects such as reproductive effects, teratogenic, mutagentic and or carcinogenic effects. While endosulfans can and do affect a number of body systems chronically, the case of the children in the fruit orchards is an acute case. It seems that despite the age of the original case, we at least have an answer regarding the poisoning of the children. - Mod.TG   .

Pregnant women living in or travelling to such areas are at equal risk as the rest of the population of being infected by viruses borne by this vector. Maternal infection with Zika virus may go unnoticed as some people will not develop symptoms. Although Zika virus infection in pregnancy is typically a mild disease, an unusual increase in cases of congenital microcephaly, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and other neurological complications in areas where outbreaks have occurred, has significantly raised concern for pregnant women and their families, as well as health providers and policy-makers.  The aim of this document is to provide interim guidance for interventions to reduce the risk of maternal Zika virus infection and to manage potential complications during pregnancy. This guidance is based on the best available research evidence and covers areas prioritized by an international, multidisciplinary group of health care professionals and other stakeholders. Specifically, it presents guidance for preventing Zika virus infection;antenatal care and management of women with infection; and care during pregnancy for all pregnant women living in affected areas, with the aim of optimizing health outcomes for mothers and newborns.

Thirteen years ago, their son became ill with whooping cough. At just 7-weeks-old, he nearly died. \"It was awful. He couldn't breathe,\" his mother said. The memory of that time still brings the Canmore mom to tears. \"I will never forget it - they had to suck out his lungs. A 7-week-old baby and they had to suck out his lungs just so he could breathe.\" The mother says her son spent 22 terrifying days in hospital, fighting to survive an infection that can be fatal for babies. \"Children can still die from pertussis (whooping cough) even in the care of a physician. We were certainly told that when her son was in the oxygen tent and going through that process,\" said the son's dad. It's what health officials in southern Alberta are most afraid of as an outbreak of whooping cough continues more than a month after it was 1st declared. There are 168 cases now connected to the outbreak in the south zone, while there have been 394 cases so far this year 2017 province-wide. \"We have had infants in the past who have died (from whooping cough) at a very young age, so that's what we're hoping to avoid with all of this - we want to protect those most vulnerable,\" said Dr. Karin Goodison, Alberta Health Services Medical Officer of Health for the south zone. The best protection against whooping cough is immunization, but in pockets around the province, Goodison says vaccination rates are very low. As a result, outbreaks of diseases like whooping cough, measles and mumps have become common. \"Once it starts in that area, we get a large number of cases in high concentration and that's when we get an impact on our immunized populations.\" Byline: Heather Yourex-West  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\.org/post/20150115.3093551 and my colleague Mod.LL's comments in Pertussis - USA (06) http://promedmail.org/post/20160917.4495935. - Mod.ML ", "dates": ["Date: Tue 8 Aug 2017", "Sungai Siput last week [week of Sun 30 Jul 2017]", "Department went viral on [Fri 4 Aug 2017]", "Keningau with a population of about 200 000 residents is a district", "Date: Wed 9 Aug 2017", "[Grant County with a population of 89 120 residents is in the center", "Date: Fri 4 Aug 2017", "continue at 4 months 6 months 15-18 months and 4-6 years of age", "[Forsyth County with a population of 350 670 residents is located in", "Date: Fri 4 Aug 2017 9:08 AM EDT", "Orange County with a population of 372 813 residents is located in", "Date: Thu 27 Jul 2017 9:56 AM", "1st half of 2017 compared to the same timeframe in 2016 the Indiana", "State Department of Health said [Thu 27 Jul 2017]", "There were 66 cases of whooping cough in the 1st half of 2016", "compared to 136 cases in 2017", "Date: Wed 26 Jul 2017 7:22 pm", "With nearly 400 cases of whooping cough this year [2017] across", "south zone while there have been 394 cases so far this year [2017]", "org/post/20150115", "3093551 and my colleague Mod", "org/post/20160917", "4495935"], "title": "Pertussis (08): Malaysia, USA, Canada "}, "24": {"sentences": "   Tue 15 Aug 2017 Source: Contagion Live edited Following the recent death of an Iowa infant who suffered complications after becoming infected with the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) likely due to a kiss, health experts are reminding the public that the virus can spread easily to babies. Oral herpes is a highly contagious virus that is spread via oral-to-oral contact, such as kissing. The WHO estimates that 3.7 billion individuals around the world have an HSV-1 infection, with the Americas having the lowest prevalence of the virus. HSV-1 is typically acquired during childhood and never goes away, though the infection is typically asymptomatic with most individuals unaware that they even have it. Visible symptoms of oral herpes appear as open sores or ulcers in and around the mouth, or sores on the lips known as cold sores. Less common is herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), a sexually transmitted infection affecting an estimated 417 million individuals worldwide. In rare cases, a woman infected with genital HSV-1 can pass the virus on to her baby during vaginal delivery, and less commonly, a baby can contract the virus through other forms of contact. In recent news, a baby girl born in Iowa on 1 Jul 2017, died less than 3 weeks later of viral meningitis, an infection of the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord; the infection was caused by HSV-1. The baby's parents and doctors say she became infected with the virus when she was less than a week old after being kissed by someone with HSV-1 who had a cold sore. The baby soon stopped eating and was unresponsive when her parents tried to wake her up. The parents took the infant to Blank Children's Hospital in Des Moines, where doctors diagnosed the baby with meningitis from an HSV-1 infection, and the baby was transferred to University of Iowa Children's Hospital. Neither of the parents tested positive for the virus, and said the infant likely picked up the infection from a visitor. The baby's mother announced the infant's death in a Facebook post on 18 Jul 2017. \"The majority of neonatal HSV occurs as a result of perinatal transmission, where an infant acquires HSV via the maternal genital tract,\" says pediatric infectious disease specialist and Contagion\u00ae editorial advisory board member Kengo Inagaki, MD, of the University of Mississippi. Perinatal transmission accounts for about 85 percent of infant HSV cases, he notes. \"It is believed that about 10 percent of neonatal HSV is acquired postnatally, from someone shedding HSV from the mouth who then kisses the baby, from exposure to HSV from a breast lesion, et cetera.\" Dr Inagaki explains that the symptoms of HSV infection in neonates and young infants can vary. Herpes can result in skin, eye, or mouth (SEM) infections in some babies, and in more serious cases, it leads to central nervous system (CNS) disease, such as meningitis and disseminated disease. \"SEM disease is the most common, and can progress to CNS or disseminated disease, and needs to be treated,\" says Dr Inagaki, noting that eye infections can lead to vision loss. \"CNS disease can present with seizures, poor feeding, lethargy, and fever. It can result in permanent neurodevelopmental complications, although not all patients have sequelae. Disseminated disease can involve multiple organs, including CNS, liver, and lungs.\" If left untreated, mortality due to CNS infection or disseminated disease can be high. While doctors can take certain steps to prevent HSV transmission from mother to infant during birth, the American Academy of Pediatrics notes that parents, family members, or friends with cold sores must take extra precautions and avoid kissing infants, particularly with babies under 6 months of age who have weak immune systems. Dr Inagaki notes that if there are HSV lesions on the breast, a mother should avoid breastfeeding from that breast. An infant who has been infected with HSV may have a low grade fever and one or more small skin blisters, and symptoms can appear within 2 to 12 days of exposure to the virus. Parents are urged to call their pediatrician if such symptoms occur. . Although HSV-1 can be present in oral secretions without overt lesions, the amount of virus is less so the risk of transmission is smaller. - Mod.LL   .

The chances of getting Zika from mosquitoes living above that altitude are very low.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to Argentina or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers considering pregnancy:  Before you or your partner travel, talk to your health care provider about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection.  Wait before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.  If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex &ndash; or do not have sex &ndash; for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.

Travelers considering pregnancy  Talk to your health care provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you&rsquo;re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Wait at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  Men are advised to wait longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.gov  Contact CDC  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  1600 Clifton Road  Atlanta ,  GA  30329-4027  USA  800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)  Contact CDC-INFO  TOP", "dates": [" Page created: May 26 2016", " Page last updated: August 08 2017", " Page last reviewed: August 08 2017", " 30329-4027", " 800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)"], "title": ["Zika Virus in Argentina"]}, "425": {"sentences": "   Fri 11 Aug 2017 09:08PM Source: Channel NewsAsia edited A scandal involving eggs contaminated with insecticide spread to 15 EU countries, Switzerland and as far away as Hong Kong on Fri 11 Aug 2017 as the European Commission called for a special meeting on the growing crisis. Ministers and food safety chiefs from around the European Union are set to meet on Tue 6 Sep 2017 in a bid to get countries to stop \"blaming and shaming\" each other over the scare involving the chemical fipronil. Millions of eggs have been pulled from supermarket shelves across Europe and dozens of poultry farms closed since the discovery of fipronil, which can harm human health, was made public on 1 Aug 2017. The issue has sparked a row between Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, the 3 countries at the epicentre of the crisis, about how long they knew about the problem. \"Blaming and shaming will bring us nowhere and I want to stop this,\" Vytenis Andriukaitis, the European Commissioner for health and food safety, told AFP as he announced the meeting. \"We need to work together to draw the necessary lessons and move forward instead.\" European Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said that \"this is not, let's be clear, a crisis meeting\" and it is being held next month September 2017 to get \"distance to the events\". Fipronil is commonly used to get rid of fleas, lice and ticks from animals but is banned by the European Union from use in the food industry. The EU insists there is no threat to human health, but the World Health Organization (WHO) says that when eaten in large quantities it can harm people's kidneys, liver and thyroid glands. Brussels said the 15 affected EU countries were Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Sweden, Britain, Austria, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Denmark, along with non-EU Switzerland. But in a sign the crisis is going global, Brussels also announced that Hong Kong had received some tainted eggs from the Netherlands, with the southern Chinese city becoming the 1st place in Asia known to be affected. As well as dealing with the immediate food safety issue, the EU is also seeking to calm tempers over the egg row after a series of divisive crises in the bloc in recent years, from Brexit to migration. Belgium earlier this week week of Mon 6 Aug 2017 accused the Netherlands of knowing about the fipronil eggs since November 2016 and failing to notify other countries. On Thu 10 Aug 2017 Dutch Health Minister Edith Schippers admitted the government had made \"errors\" but denied a cover-up. \"We were well aware of a report of the presence of fipronil in the pens of egg-laying hens in November 2016, but there was no indication at the time that fipronil itself was found in the eggs,\" said Schippers. A Dutch whistleblower separately said he had told the authorities that Chickfriend, the Dutch company at the centre of the scandal, was illegally using fipronil in the treatment of lice in chicken pens in The Netherlands. \"I am the anonymous whistleblower,\" Nick Hermens told the NPO public broadcaster. A Belgian company, Poultry Vision, has said it provided Chickfriend with the chemical. Dutch and Belgian investigators carried out coordinated raids on several premises on Thu 10 Aug 2017, arresting 2 people at Chickfriend. However, Belgium itself has been forced to admit that it knew about fipronil in eggs back in June 2017 but kept it secret for nearly 2 months because of a criminal investigation. Fresh discoveries of contaminated eggs have continued daily. Denmark said on Fri 11 Aug 2017 it had found 2 tonnes of fipronil-tainted scrambled eggs, bringing the total of contaminated eggs to 22 tonnes, mainly from Belgium. Poland said it had discovered about 40 000 eggs imported from Germany. French Agriculture Minister Stephane Travert said that since April 2017 the country had sold nearly 250 000 contaminated eggs, imported from Belgium and the Netherlands, but the risk for consumers was \"very low\" given French eating habits. The food scare is one of the biggest to hit Europe since the 2013 horsemeat scandal when equine meat was falsely labelled and mis-sold. Previous food scandals include contamination of chickens and eggs by dioxin in 1999, which began in Belgium, and mad-cow disease via cattle feed contaminated by the ground-up carcasses of animals infected with a deadly brain disorder - which ran from roughly 1986 to 1998 and started in Britain.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\.

outbreak in DRC  Alert and response operations  Diseases  Biorisk reduction  Poliovirus in Madagascar  Disease outbreak news  24 July 2015  In Madagascar, 8 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) have been confirmed, with dates of onset of paralysis ranging from 22 April to 29 May 2015. These new cases are genetically linked to cVDPV1 isolated from a case with onset on 29 September 2014, which indicates that the circulation of cVDPV 1 first detected in September 2014 continues and is geographically wide-spread. Five of the new cases are from Androy region in the south of the country while the other cases are from Menabe, Anosy and Boeni regions in the centre of Madagascar. The previous case with onset in September occurred in Sofia region, which is situated in the north of the country.  Public health response  Since the detection of the September case, outbreak response activities have been conducted throughout the country, including subnational immunization days and national immunization days held in December and April, respectively. Nevertheless, the extent, timeliness and quality of the outbreak response to date have been insufficient to interrupt circulation of this strain, and were further complicated by flooding affecting the country. More than 25% of children across Madagascar remain un- or under-immunized. The emergency outbreak response has recently been further intensified.  WHO risk assessment  Circulating VDPVs are rare but well-documented strains of poliovirus that can emerge in some populations which are inadequately immunized. A robust outbreak response can rapidly stop such events from occurring. The emergence of cVDPV strains underscores the importance of maintaining high levels of routine vaccination coverage. Multiple cVDPV strains have emerged in Madagascar during the last 15 years and their transmission has been interrupted following implementation of supplementary immunization campaigns. WHO currently assesses the risk of international spread from Madagascar to be low.  WHO advice  It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.  WHO\u2019s International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel.

Health officials in Pakistan have reported a large outbreak of chickenpox, also known as varicella. Cases in children and adults, including deaths, have been reported in 10 districts. More than half of the cases have occurred in the Faisalabad District.  What can travelers do to protect themselves?  Chickenpox can be serious, especially in babies, adults, and those with weakened immune systems. CDC recommends that travelers to Pakistan who have not had chickenpox protect themselves by making sure they are vaccinated. Anyone over the age of 12 months who has not had chickenpox or the vaccine and does not have contraindications to the chickenpox vaccine should get the vaccine: 1 dose for children age 12 months through 3 years and 2 doses for persons age 4 years and older.

Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.  If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex &ndash; or do not have sex &ndash; for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More Zika information for pregnant women  2.

Travelers considering pregnancy  Talk to your health care provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you&rsquo;re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Wait at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.

Zika virus replication in the mosquito _Culex quinquefasciatus_ in Brazil. Emerg Microbes Infect. 2017; 6(8): e69. doi: 10.1038/emi.2017.<br><br><strong>59  Abstract </strong><br> Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has recently been associated with an increased incidence of neonatal microcephaly and other neurological disorders. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito bite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some cases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main vector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other mosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the virus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit ZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of laboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. Interestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the midgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in Recife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially fed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx. quinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced. Collectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range of ZIKV vectors than anticipated.  <br><br>Communicated by: Roland H\u00fcbner Superior Health Council Brussels Belgium Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active virus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their ability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step toward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_ fed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in saliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing. The study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a competent vector. Several other studies have shown this species to be inefficient vectors or refractory to Zika virus infection. One wonders if the specific _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ used or the Zika virus isolates with which they were tested could account for these very different results. Resolving these discrepancies is important because this mosquito species is very widely distributed around the world and bears directly on risk of outbreaks in geographic areas where _Aedes aegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_ , Zika virus vectors, do not occur. - Mod.TY ", "dates": ["As of 17 Aug 2017", "Bermuda / 0 / 0 / 6 / 0 / 0", "Canada / 0 / 0 / 507 / 0 / 1", "USA / 0 / 224 / 5140 / 0 / 91", "Mexico / 0 / 9290 / 15 / 0 / 15", "Belize / 1701 / 255 / 0 / 0 / 0", "Costa Rica / 6998 / 1887 / 32 / 0 / 6", "El Salvador / 11 621 / 51 / 0 / 0 / 4", "Guatemala / 3741 / 983 / 0 / 0 / 140", "Honduras / 32 130 / 302 / 0 / 0 / 4", "Nicaragua / 0 / 2060 / 3 / 0 / 2", "Panama / 4802 / 1035 / 42 / 0 / 13", "Cuba / 0 / 187 / 58 / 0 / 0", "Dominican Republic / 4913 / 345 / 0 / 0 / 93", "French Guiana / 10 500 / 483 / 10 / 0 / 1", "Guadeloupe / 30 845 / 382 / 0 / 0 / 5", "Haiti / 2955 / 5 / 0 / 0 / 1", "Martinique / 36 680 / 21 / 0 / 0 / 5", "Puerto Rico / 0 / 40 545 / 137 / 5 / 47", "Saint Barthelemy / 1005 / 61 / 0 / 0 / 0", "Saint Martin / 3283 / 200 / 0 / 0 / 1", "Anguilla / 32 / 23 / 1 / 0 / 0", "Antigua and Barbuda / 540 / 25 / 2 / 0 / 0", "Aruba / 1208 / 703 / 7 / 0 / 0", "Bahamas / 440 / 25 / 3 / 0 / 0", "Barbados / 715 / 150 / 0 / 0 / 1", "Bonaire St Eustatius and Saba / 235 / 437 / 0 / 0 / 0", "Caymans / 232 / 31 / 10 / 0 / 0", "Curacao / 4476 / 2049 / 0 / 0 / 0", "Dominica / 1154 / 79 / 0 / 0 / 0", "Grenada / 335 / 118 / 0 / 0 / 2", "Guyana / 0 / 37 / 0 / 0 / 0", "Jamaica / 7650 / 203 / 0 / 0 / 0", "Montserrat / 18 / 5 / 0 / 0 / 0", "Saint Kits and Nevis / 554 / 33 / 0 / 0 / 0", "Saint Lucia / 822 / 50 / 0 / 0 / 0", "Saint Vincent and the Grenadines / 508 / 83 / 0 / 0 / 0", "Sint Maarten / 253 / 149 / 0 / 0 / 0", "Suriname / 2768 / 724 / 0 / 4 / 4", "Trinidad and Tobago / 0 / 718 / 1 / 0 / 3", "Turks and Caicos / 200 / 25 / 3 / 0 / 0", "Virgin Islands (UK) / 74 / 53 / 0 / 0 / 0", "Virgin Islands (USA) / 1156 / 1024 / 2 / 0 / 0", "Bolivia / 2519 / 785 / 4 / 0 / 14", "Colombia / 98 474 / 9802 / 0 / 0 / 185", "Ecuador / 3842 / 2214 / 15 / 0 / 7", "Peru / 6370 / 1498 / 22 / 0 / 0", "Venezuela / 59 965 / 2413 / 0 / 0 / 0", "Brazil / 218 931 / 135 740 / 0 / 11 / 2869", "Argentina / 869 / 138 / 40 / 0 / 2", "Chile / 0 / 0 / 34 / 0 / 0", "Paraguay / 662 / 16 / 0 / 0 / 2", "Uruguay / 0 / 0 / 1 / 0 / 0", "Totals Americas / 566 176 / 217 666 / 6095 / 20 / 3521", " A 12 Aug 2017 report quotes USA health", " 16 Aug 2017", " 3 Aug 2017", " 4 Aug 2017", " 25 Jul 2017", " (reported) 450 cases of whom 185 are", " 30 Jun 2017", "[A report dated 17 Aug 2017 mentions 65 cases so far this year (2017)", " 14 Aug 2017", " 15 Jul 2017", " 20 Jul 2017", " 5 Aug 2017", " 6 Aug 2017", " 28 Jul 2017", "[An 11 Aug 2017 report indicates that from 1 Jan-25 Apr 2017 2550", "pregnancies;

Zika virus (or Zika) has been reported in The Bahamas. Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in The Bahamas are infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:  Women who are pregnant:  Do not travel to The Bahamas.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to The Bahamas or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers considering pregnancy:  Before you or your partner travel, talk to your health care provider about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection.  Wait before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.  If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex &ndash; or do not have sex &ndash; for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex, or do not have sex, for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy  Talk to your health care provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you&rsquo;re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Wait at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  Men are advised to wait longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.gov  Contact CDC  Centers for Disease Control and

cultured koi carp (_Cyprinus carpio koi_) in British Columbia (BC). This is the 1st detection of KHVD in BC by the CFIA, but the disease has been previously detected in Manitoba and Ontario. The disease detection was associated with an import of koi from Israel by a wholesaler who distributed fish to greenhouses, pet stores and garden centres within BC for sale to private individuals. As a result of this detection, the import of all susceptible species of aquatic animals from Israel for the following end uses will be suspended until further notice: - aquarium - commercial; - aquarium - private; - outdoor holding unit - commercial; and - outdoor holding unit - private. The CFIA is committed to working with Israel to ensure that Canada's aquatic animal health import requirements are met and the suspended zoosanitary export certificate, which applies to all exports from Israel for the aforementioned end uses, can be renegotiated as quickly as possible in order to minimize any impact on trade. KHVD poses no risk to human health or food safety; however, this virus can infect other susceptible species and is reportable under Canada's Reportable Diseases Regulations. Individuals or businesses that are concerned that their fish may have koi herpesvirus disease should contact their local CFIA area and district office immediately. Sick or dead fish should not be disposed of in natural waterways. The disease is transmitted by fish to fish contact and it is also possible that the disease can spread through contaminated water, nets and other equipment. As other herpesvirus, KHD has the capacity to remain latent in the infected fish and become activated and cause disease when some stressors trigger it. More information on KHD is found in OIE Aquatic Manual chapter (2009 update), which is available at  . - Mod.PMB   .

This atypical BSE was classified as L-type. Native cases of BSE in the United States have all been atypical BSE cases; this is only the 4th case of atypical BSE identified in over 20 years of surveillance. The last case was in 2012.

The US Department of Agriculture identified a case of \"atypical BSE\" in an 11-year-old beef-type cow thorough its established surveillance program. The animal tested positive on a screening test, but follow-up tests at the USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories confirmed the atypical form of the agent. As noted in the OIE report, this is the 1st detection of BSE in the United States since 2012. The United States has identified 3 other prior cases of atypical BSE, bringing the total number of atypical BSE cases to 4. There was one case of classical BSE (feed transmitted) that was detected in 2003, but that case was associated with an imported cow from Canada. Classical BSE was the agent responsible for the extensive cases, primarily in Europe, and which was associated with the feeding of meat-and-bone meal to cattle. Today, following the removal of specified risk materials such as brain and spinal cord, and the prohibition of a ruminant-to-ruminant feed ban, classical BSE is very rare. Atypical BSE is thought to occur spontaneously. It occurs sporadically in older cattle at a very low rate. It is not unusual for countries with good surveillance programs to identify atypical BSE.

Zika virus (or Zika) has been reported in Maldives. Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in Maldives are infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:  Women who are pregnant:  Do not travel to Maldives.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to Maldives or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers considering pregnancy:  Before you or your partner travel, talk to your health care provider about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection.  Wait before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.  If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex &ndash; or do not have sex &ndash; for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex, or do not have sex, for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy  Talk to your health care provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you&rsquo;re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Wait at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  Men are advised to wait longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.gov  Contact CDC  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  1600 Clifton Road  Atlanta ,  GA  30329-4027  USA  800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)  Contact CDC-INFO  TOP", "dates": [" Page created: March 10 2017", " Page last updated: August 08 2017", " Page last reviewed: August 08 2017", " 30329-4027", " 800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)"], "title": ["Zika Virus in Maldives"]}, "202": {"sentences": "   Fri 14 Jul 2017 Source: Producer.com About 2600 bison cows and bulls, with 1800 calves at side, roam the 114 000 acres about 46 134 ha of the Flying D ranch Gallatin Gateway, Montana, but even this vast area and relative isolation can't protect them from illness. In fact, the wide-open spaces that make this ranch ideal for bison are also ideal for other wildlife, including an elk herd that harbours brucellosis and spreads it to bison. Ted Turner, the largest bison owner in the world, bought the Flying D in 1989 and put it under a conservation easement in 1990. It comprises about 175 sq miles about 453.25 sq km of contiguous property in the southern part of Montana. However, the bison herd has been quarantined by the US Department of Agriculture since 2010, when some animals tested positive for brucellosis. Chronic infection in the elk herd that frequents the property means the bison herd will never be free of the contagious and untreatable disease. \"The only real solution is going to be a better vaccine,\" said ranch manager Danny Johnson. \"Until there's a better vaccine, there is no chance of us getting off of quarantine because we have to have 3 consecutive (negative) tests\" of the entire bison herd. Johnson said the Montana Fish and Game department estimates 27 percent of the elk herd in the region carries brucellosis. Since the bison herd is tested only once a year, Johnson said the chances of finding no brucellosis cases in that many bison over 3 years are virtually nil. \"We were quarantined for brucellosis in 2010, and it's from migrating elk. We're never going to get away from that, so basically animals cannot leave here unless they're on a USDA sealed truck and trailer and going to slaughter, so we try to keep them here as long as we can.\" For the Flying D, that has led to establishment of 2 Supplemental Nutrition for Animal Performance (SNAP) areas on the ranch. They are essentially feedlots, although Johnson said they're trying to avoid that term. Each lot holds 499 head, keeping numbers below the level where commercial feedlot rules would apply. Each allows 800 sq feet 74.32 sq m per animal. \"The main reason we've gone into it, and actually all the ranches are kind of heading this direction anyway, the longer we can keep (the bison) home, the more comfortable they're going to be,\" said Johnson. The bison have free choice of grain and can choose from 3 different kinds of hay so they can follow natural instincts to balance nutritional needs and rumen health. Animals enter the SNAP facilities at 18 months and are shipped at about 28 months after 180 days on feed. Young bulls are fed through fall and winter and heifers in spring and summer. \"We're trying to grow things on this ranch, rather than importing feeds ... wherever we can and try to feed them out,\" said Johnson. \"All the hay comes off the ranch right now and we're trying programs with oats and barley. And field peas, we tried that. Just things we can grow here on the ranch.\" About 10 percent of heifers are kept each year as replacements, and the rest are fed out. During the once-per-year processing, the entire herd is tested, tagged and sorted. It takes about 5 weeks. Back in 2010, when brucellosis appeared during random blood test screening, the USDA demanded that the entire herd be tested. That required a 2nd run through the chutes, and Johnson said he thinks the stress left the herd open to an outbreak of mycoplasma. About 800 head were lost to that illness in 2010. \"The herd's healthy right now,\" said Johnson. Turner owns 3 other ranches in Montana, 6 in Nebraska, 3 in New Mexico, 2 in South Dakota, one in Kansas, and 3 in Argentina. He owns about 56 000 bison.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. When you see one of the ranch's 1000 head herds grazing one of the extensive meadows it is immediately obvious why Ted Turner is besotted with this beast. It is beautiful beyond belief and the large grazing herds invoke the plains history of this country. And that large herd is in fact made up of individual maternal mobs and elderly bulls; the young bulls are scattered around the periphery. When you buy bison beef this is the environment that they come from. Turner's ranch staff and management are expert. Every animal is microchipped so that when it goes through the headgate at the head of the chute, its record immediately comes up on the foreman's laptop. Following an anthrax epidemic in 2010 they are vaccinated with Sterne; a trial showed that a single shot managed to cover them for the next year's anthrax season. I checked with Dave Hunter, ranch veterinarian, about the possibility of adult vaccination against brucellosis. His reply: \"We tried adult vaccination of the bison, but as we only handle our herds when they are pregnant, and on the safety trial 18 out of 20 aborted with RB51. Not good. We are still trying. Dr Schurig (developer of RB51) is working on modifying the vaccine to better protect bison. We will have to see.\" Our good wishes are with them. There are a fair number of elk on the Flying-D and to a degree mix with the bison. But during the summer when their horns are in velvet the bulls move up to higher altitudes. - Mod.

The infected animal was first identified during voluntary herd testing on a Madison County ranch. Infection was confirmed by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa (IA) by tissue culture following euthanasia of the animal. The ranch has been placed under quarantine and the department has initiated an epidemiological investigation. Testing of all other animals on the ranch is already under way. \"This animal previously tested negative in December of 2016, indicating this is a recent infection,\" said state veterinarian, Marty Zaluski. \"Because of the continued risk of transmission from positive elk in the DSA, we expect transmission to domestic cattle or bison to occasionally occur.\" Producers with cattle or bison in the DSA are subject to increased identification and testing requirements. \"Through the significant efforts of veterinarians and producers, we are able to find these cases early and within the boundaries of our DSA, thus protecting our state as well as our trading partners,\" Zaluski said. This is the 9th herd found to be affected by brucellosis since the DSA was created in 2010. In all 3 Greater Yellowstone Area states, elk have been determined to be the likely source of infection in livestock. The disease investigation and pending results from genetic fingerprinting (genotyping) of the cultured bacteria will help the department better understand the source of infection in this case. The mission of the Montana Department of Livestock is to control and eradicate animal diseases, prevent the transmission of animal diseases to humans, and to protect the livestock industry from theft and predatory animals. For more information on the Montana Department of Livestock, visit . The infectious disease can affect humans, wildlife and domestic animals, including dogs. Historically, cattle have been the primary carriers but as states move more into close interaction with wildlife, such as the Greater Yellowstone area, or with managing cervids and buffalo, the carrier in a particular area may not necessarily be cattle. This article states that it may be the elk. Other wildlife carriers include bison, reindeer, caribou and feral swine. Large animals, especially elk and bison may have no obvious signs of the disease. The brucella bacterium collects in the lymphatic system, the udder and the reproductive tract. Abortion is a sign of the disease. Other signs in animals may include retained placenta, swollen testicles, reduced pregnancy rates, decreased milk production and swollen, painful joints. In humans this disease is known by several names, including Malta fever, Mediterranean fever and undulant fever. Humans may acquire the disease through assisting an infected animal in the birthing process, examining an aborted fetus without protection, drinking unpasteurized milk or other dairy products, through an open wound, or even intact skin, or a slash of infected body fluids into the eyes, nose or mouth. Slaughter workers, and veterinarians are at risk because of the nature of their jobs. Consumption of infected raw meat by humans may also be a source of infection, however if the meat is properly cooked it does not present a disease risk. When a person is infected clinical signs and symptoms may include, fever, body aches, anorexia, lethargy, weakness, fatigue as well as swollen lymph nodes and possibly enlargement of the spleen and liver. Symptoms may develop over several weeks or months, or even immediately. Joints, bones, and especially the spine may be painful. Other joints such as ankles, hips, knees and shoulders may be swollen, warm, and painful. The DSA has had problems with this disease before and therefore this disease was likely caught quite early. - Mod. - CopyEd.AO ", "dates": ["Date: Thu 24 Aug 2017 12:51 PM EDT"], "title": "Brucellosis  - USA (07): (MT) bovine "}, "216": {"sentences": "   Mon 17 Jul 2017, 7:35 AM Source: ABC 15 edited A bobcat attack was caught on camera in Anthem this weekend. Male JG posted the video to Facebook and provided the footage to ABC15. JG said the bobcat ran after and attacked a dog. A witness saw what was happening and jumped out to help. Male SV was bitten by the bobcat as he got the bobcat off the dog. His hand was punctured, his thumb fractured, and his arm clawed. \"Once I saw the cat spring on top of the dog, and the owner was trying to pull the dog back, I said, 'Someone else has to help out here,'\" said SV. The Arizona Game and Fish Department said the bobcat tested positive for rabies. They said the last mammal that tested positive for rabies in Maricopa County was a mountain lion back in 2012. They added that this is a rarity, and they are investigating where the bobcat contracted rabies from, even though at the moment, wildlife officials believe it could have contracted rabies from a bat. They said the bobcat incident does not \"imply we have a problem in the Valley\" and it is \"not a reason to panic.\" SV received a rabies and tetanus shot. There was no shortage of Good Samaritans when the attack happened. When SV jumped out of the car to help, his adrenaline was going, but so was his car. That's when JG, who recorded video of the incident, ran over to stop the runaway car after SV inadvertently left it in gear. According to game and fish officials, an McCoy deputy found the bobcat in a storm drain away from the crowd. A field supervisor with the game and fish department authorized the deputy to shoot the bobcat. The only way to test an animal for rabies is to test brain tissue, so the animal needs to be killed, according to Amy Burnett, a public information officer with the game and fish department said. SV said, besides the fright, the dog only suffered a scratch. It was current on its shots, but will still need to be quarantined for an unspecified amount of time, according to Burnett.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. ProMED reported 2 rabid bobcat events in Arizona in 2010: Rabies, wildlife - USA: (AZ) http://promedmail.org/post/20100101.0013 (on 1 Jan 2010) Rabies, wildlife - USA (06): (AZ) http://promedmail.org/post/20100425. According to the Arizona Department of Health Services in Arizona, the principal rabies hosts are bats, skunks, and foxes. These animals carry their own distinct rabies virus variants or \"strains\". When rabies activity within these animal groups increases, rabies can \"spillover\" into other mammal species, such as bobcats, coyotes, javelina, cats, dogs, horses, cows, etc. Every year, approximately 30 people are exposed to rabid animals in Arizona. People who are exposed must receive vaccine and anti-rabies serum treatment to prevent infection. In Arizona, bats present the most common source of rabies exposures to humans because rabid bats often fall to the ground where they are easily accessible to people and pets. Bats are generally not aggressive. Exposure to rabid bats usually occurs when people pick up or handle a sick or dead bat. Other rabies exposures occur when people try to approach or feed wild animals, or in some cases, are attacked by rabid animals such as foxes, bobcats, and skunks. Most rabies exposures can be avoided by simply leaving bats and other wild animals alone. The last documented human rabies death in Arizona was in 1981. All bite or contact exposures should be reported immediately to local animal control or health officials. Reports of suspect rabies infection in livestock and the quarantine of livestock that bite humans should be handled by calling the Arizona State Veterinarian's Office at (602) 542-4293. - Mod.MHJ The report notes that the victim received rabies and tetanus shots. Given that he reported being bitten and had puncture wounds on his hand presumed to be from the bobcat, let's hope the medical provider also administered human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG) at the site of the bite wound(s) if needed. Current post-exposure prophylaxis recommends HRIG ( ) in addition to 4 doses of vaccine on days 0, 3, 7, and 14 if the victim was not previously vaccinated for rabies. Previously vaccinated individuals receive 2 doses of vaccine on days 0 and 3. - Mod.JH   .

The first case was identified on 17 August in a rural township in Moramanga district. The case passed away on 19 August. As of 30 August, 14 cases, including 10 deaths, were reported. All confirmed cases are of the pneumonic form. Since 27 August, no new cases have been reported from the affected or neighbouring districts.  Public health response  The national task force has been activated to manage the outbreak. With support from partners \u2013 including WHO and the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar \u2013 the government of Madagascar is implementing thorough public health measures, including active case and contact finding, provision of chemoprophylaxis, case and contact management, enhanced epidemiologic surveillance, infection prevention and control (house disinfection), vector control activities, social mobilization, coordination and resource mobilization.  WHO risk assessment  WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction based on the current information available. In urban areas, such as Antananarivo, the surveillance of epidemic risk indicators is highly recommended for the implementation of preventive vector control activities.  Background  Plague is a bacterial disease caused by Yersinia pestis, which primarily affects wild rodents. It is spread from one rodent to another by fleas. Humans bitten by an infected flea usually develop a bubonic form of plague, which produces the characteristic plague bubo (a swelling of the lymph node). If the bacteria reach the lungs, the patient develops pneumonia (pneumonic plague), which is then transmissible from person to person through infected droplets spread by coughing. If diagnosed early, bubonic plague can be successfully treated with antibiotics. Pneumonic plague, on the other hand, is one of the most deadly infectious diseases; patients can die 24 hours after infection. The mortality rate depends on how soon treatment is started, but is always very high.  The current outbreak follows another plague outbreak that occurred in Madagascar between 2014 and 2015, with a peak in November 2014 when over 335 cases and 79 deaths were reported.

The woman in her 50s died some 10 days after being bitten by the cat last year after she took the animal to a veterinary hospital. Authorities have since confirmed that she developed SFTS, a disease transmitted by bites from a certain group of virus-carrying ticks. Human-to-human infections of the tick virus through blood contact have been reported, but ministry officials believe the Japanese woman's death could be the 1st case of a human dying from the bite of an infected animal. \"No reports on animal-to-human transmission cases have been made so far,\" a health ministry official told AFP on Tue 25 Jul 2017. \"It's still not confirmed the virus came from the cat, but it's possible that it's the (world's) 1st case,\" she said. Another official said there were no signs the woman had been bitten by a tick. SFTS, or severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome, triggers symptoms including severe fever, vomiting, and diarrhoea. In Japan some 60 people contract the disease every year from tick bites with a fatality rate of some 20 percent, according to the Japanese ministry. No preventive medicines or vaccines are available for the disease. \"There are only symptomatic therapies, such as dealing with fever or diarrhoea,\" the ministry official said. \"The best way to avoid the infection is not to be bitten by ticks,\" she added.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Rapporteur George A Robertson SFTS cases have been reported in Japan before. In 2013, the total number of cases came to 8, and while at that time the 1st 5 were all deaths, these 3 people, infected between 2005 and 2012, all recovered. In 2014 SFTS virus infected 53 people and left 21 people dead. SFTS virus has been shown to be tick transmitted. Apparently, the diagnosis has been laboratory confirmed for the woman but no mention is made that the cat had a confirmed SFTS infection, leaving doubt about the cat as a source of the woman's infection. SFTS virus is a phlebovirus in the bunyavirus family. Characterization of the virus responsible for SFTS was described first by Yu XJ et al in \"Fever with thrombocytopenia associated with a novel bunyavirus in China\" (N Engl J Med. 2011; 364(16): 1523-32;  ). - Mod.TY   .

The wounds are so painful that some animals die in shock,\" says Tanya Lenn from the Red Squirrel Sanctuary Berlin/Brandenburg, who saw many red squirrels recover after intensive care. \"Despite all efforts  if they are found too late not all animals will make it.\" Some of the deceased red squirrels were submitted to the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research (IZW) for pathological investigations. The responsible wildlife pathologist, Gudrun Wibbelt, detected profound inflammatory skin infections in all animals complicated by secondary colonization of different bacteria and yeasts. \"But the most important finding in the diseased skin were oval inclusion bodies within the skin cells visible only by microscopical examination,\" explains Wibbelt. With the aid of electron microscopy, viral particles could be demonstrated in these inclusions in all investigated squirrels. Wibbelt reports that \"shape and size of these viruses are similar to cowpox virus.\" To verify this, suspicion samples were sent to the national reference laboratory for poxviruses at the Robert Koch-Institute (RKI). To their big surprise routine molecular diagnostic techniques did not produce positive results. Subsequently, Livia Schrick and Andreas Nitsche (RKI) isolated the virus. On the basis of this virus isolate their colleagues Simon Tausch and Piotr Dabrowski decoded the whole genome of the virus. The researchers compared the genetic information of this virus with all known poxviruses. \"We discovered that the 'Berlin squirrelpox virus' is a novel poxvirus species as it is only remotely related to other poxviruses,\" clarifies Nitsche. \"The virus seems to specifically infect red squirrels, while infections in humans or pets are rather unlikely,\" comments Wibbelt. Skin diseases caused by another squirrelpox virus have been known for a long time in red squirrels from Great Britain. Here, this other pathogen is partly responsible for large-scale regional extinction of red squirrels across most parts of England. The bigger grey squirrels, imported from North America into England in the 19th century, were carriers of this virus species. While they remain healthy, they shed the virus to the environment from where it can be transmitted to red squirrels. In Germany grey squirrels are not present. Occasionally, the native red squirrels occur in colour variations from light grey to black  but can always be unmistakably recognized as red squirrels by the tiny hair tufts at the tips of their ears. \"The discovery of such a novel poxvirus is a small sensation among scientists working on poxviruses and all the more remarkable when this happens on your own doorstep,\" says Wibbelt.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Berlin squirrelpox virus, a new poxvirus in red squirrels, Berlin, Germany. Emerg Infect Dis. 2017; 23(10); . This Berlin squirrelpox virus (BerSQPV) causes lesions similar to those observed in British red squirrels infected with SQPV (squirrelpox virus), but the virus is different, phylogenetically and ultrastructurally. BerSQPV is suspected to have been circulating for several years among Eurasian red squirrels in the greater Berlin area. It should be established if red squirrels of this region co-evolved with this virus and generally tolerate it.

Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) - multi-country outbreak - Update 31  Coronavirus never before seen in humans is the cause of SARS  Unprecedented collaboration identifies new pathogen in record time  16 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported  GENEVA  Today, the World Health Organization announced that a new pathogen, a member of the coronavirus family never before seen in humans, is the cause of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The speed at which this virus was identified is the result of the close international collaboration of 13 laboratories from 10 countries. While many lines of evidence have found strong associations between this virus and the disease over the last weeks, final confirmation came today.  \u201cThe pace of SARS research has been astounding,\u201d said Dr. David Heymann, Executive Director, WHO Communicable Diseases programmes. \u201cBecause of an extraordinary collaboration among laboratories from countries around the world, we now know with certainty what causes SARS.\u201d  The successful identification of the coronavirus means that scientists can now confidently turn to other SARS challenges. For example, various laboratories continue to work to unravel the genetic information of the SARS virus and compare the sequences obtained from viruses in different parts of the world.  \u201cToday, the collaboration continues as top laboratory researchers have come to WHO to design the next steps, a strategy for transforming these basic research discoveries into diagnostic tools which will help us to successfully control this disease,\u201d said Heymann. \u201cNow we can move away from methods like isolation and quarantines and move aggressively towards modern intervention strategies including specific treatments and eventually vaccination. With the establishment of the causative agent, we are a crucial step closer.\u201d  This collaboration has brought together leading scientific expertise, and was established after WHO issued a global alert on SARS on 12 March 2003. The priority has been to find the cause and to develop diagnostic tests. Two laboratories in China recently joined this network of laboratories from Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.  \u201cToday, the first part of the mission of our network has been fulfilled, as researchers have both detected a hitherto unknown virus and established it as the cause of SARS. The new coronavirus has been named by WHO and member laboratories as \u201cSARS virus, \u201d said Dr Albert Osterhaus, the Director of Virology at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam. Erasmus completed the work to definitely prove that the new coronavirus causes SARS.  Over the past three weeks, due to the urgency surrounding the worldwide threat to health of SARS and early indications this was a new member of the coronavirus family, research has proceeded under the assumption that SARS was caused by a new coronavirus.  The 13 laboratories have been working on meeting Koch\u2019s postulates, necessary to prove disease causation. These postulates stipulate that to be the causal agent, a pathogen must meet four conditions: it must be found in all cases of the disease, it must be isolated from the host and grown in pure culture, it must reproduce the original disease when introduced into a susceptible host, and it must be found in the experimental host so infected.  Credit for the coronavirus findings, which definitively pinpoints the cause of SARS, is attributed to the 13 laboratories, working in conjunction with WHO.  \u201cThe people in this network have put aside profit and prestige to work together to find the cause of this new disease and to find way new ways of fighting it,\u201d said Dr Klaus St\u00f6hr, WHO virologist and the coordinator of the collaborative research network. \u201cIn this globalized world, such collaboration is the only way forward in tackling emerging diseases.\u201d  WHO and the network of laboratories dedicate their detection and characterization of the SARS virus to Dr Carlo Urbani, the WHO scientist who first alerted the world to the existence of SARS in Hanoi, Vietnam, and who died from the disease in Bangkok on 29 March 2003.

Corr.SB, edited In the midst of the health scandal of the eggs contaminated with fipronil coming from the Netherlands, the prefecture capital, Arras of Pas-de-Calais confirms analyses carried out in a French farm. All eggs laid on the farm since 28 Jul 2017 will be destroyed. In parallel, the northern prefecture confirmed today 9 Aug 2017 that a processor of egg products based in Roncq (Nord department) received a delivery of batches of contaminated eggs. New investigations are underway. The prefecture of Pas-de-Calais confirmed this Wed 9 Aug 2017 the presence of fipronil in a chicken farm with laying hens in the department. It is the 1st French farm in which traces of this insecticide, which caused the crisis of contaminated eggs that originated in the Netherlands, have been found. At the same time, the prefecture of the Nord department Lille also confirmed that a processing company the department is also involved: a processor of egg products based in Roncq was supplied with batches of contaminated eggs. According to the Pas-de-Calais prefecture, cited by 20 Minutes, the risk of contamination of the chickens has been linked to the use, by the operator, of a pest control product, DEGA-16, containing the banned substance. The site manager warned the authorities one of his suppliers was using DEGA-16, reports La Voix du Nord. Indeed, Chickfriend, the Belgian distributor of the product, illegally added fipronil to the composition of its antiparasitic drug, intended to eradicate the red louse. Pending the results of the analyzes, the eggs from this farm had been previously set aside and their sale suspended as a precaution, on 28 Jul 2017. As the results confirmed the presence of fipronil, these eggs will all be destroyed. As for the manufacturing company located in Roncq, the northern prefecture provides details this Wed 9 Aug 2017 on its site  ; in French. It said that it had been informed on 8 Aug 2017 that the processor of egg products, Ovoservices, had also \"shipped batches of contaminated eggs.\" The authorities have told our colleagues that the company \"immediately put in place the recall measures for destruction of the eggs so that they could not be sold to its customers.\" \"At the same time, the Departmental Directorate of Populations is conducting an investigation in each farm in the eggs sector of the department to ensure that the DEGA 16 has not been used,\" said the Nord prefecture. The investigations should make it possible to check \"the possible diffusion\" of the products from this plant, on French and European territories. This likely means the distribution of products from this plant. - Mod.TG Faced with the growing crisis, professionals in the sector are reassuring. Xavier Garenaux, president of the Licques Volaille poultry Defense Union of (Pas-de-Calais), reminds us that chickens intended for slaughter are killed too young to know about a possible treatment against the red louse. Most farmed chickens live only 35 to 40 days (81 days for Label Rouge chickens). Only the eggs, resulting from the farming of laying hens, would therefore be potentially affected by this health scandal.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. The WHO has set a very low level of fipronil in the eggs. While this article does not tell us the level of fipronil in the eggs, it is believed to be above the admissible limits. Without regard to the amount of fipronil in the eggs, it is possible there are happy chickens as they are no longer facing mites. - With current fipronil levels, Germany's Federal Institute for Risk Assessment estimates a child who weighs around 16 kg (35 lb) could eat 1.7 eggs per day without reaching the threshold where fipronil levels become dangerous. This includes products that contain egg, like pancakes or pasta. An adult who weights 65 kg (143 lb) could eat 7 eggs a day. The levels currently measured in contaminated eggs aren't very high and thus not dangerous for adults, however authorities and experts have advised parents to not let their children eat contaminated eggs ( ). Additionally, according to the UK Food Standards Agency ( ): \"Our risk assessment, based on all the information available, indicates that as part of a normal healthy diet this low level of potential exposure is unlikely to be a risk to public health and there is no need for consumers to be concerned. Our advice is that there is no need for people to change the way they consume or cook eggs or products containing eggs.\" So while fipronil is not approved for use in food producing animals, the agencies monitoring this situation have a risk assessment in place indicating the risk is low to consumers, but nevertheless are acting out of caution to protect them. - Mod.TG In addition to the detection of fipronil-contaminated eggs in France reported above, such findings have now been reported from several other European countries, including Romania, Sweden, Switzerland, Luxembourg, and the UK. One ton of contaminated egg yolk liquid was uncovered in Romania later on Thu 10 Aug 2017, according to the country's veterinary health authority ANSVSA. It was the 1st discovery of contaminated egg product in eastern Europe since the scandal erupted. The egg yolk liquid was found in a warehouse on the western side of the country and had been imported from Germany, but \"none of the product has been offered for sale,\" said ANSVSA. British authorities reported earlier on Thu 10 Aug 2017 that around 700 000 eggs from affected Dutch farms had been distributed in Britain. The UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) said the eggs were mixed in large batches to be used in processed foods and not sold fresh, as they were in countries like the Netherlands and Germany. 4 major British grocery chains have withdrawn such products, including sandwiches and salads, the FSA said in a statement. \"However, as this represents 0.007 per cent of the eggs we consume in the UK every year, it remains the case that it is very unlikely that there is any risk to public health from consuming these foods,\" the statement said. The FSA also said that the recalls were not being carried out owing to safety concerns, but because the ingredient is not authorized for use. Luxembourg said that eggs sold in the discount supermarket Aldi had been withdrawn after one batch was found to contain sufficient levels of fipronil to potentially pose a threat to young children, who cannot consume as much as adults safely. Aldi earlier this month August 2017 pulled all Dutch eggs from its stores in Germany, but the company said on Thu 10 Aug 2017 that its German markets would restock eggs as of Fri 11 Aug 2017. Police in the Netherlands have detained 2 men suspected of being involved in the illegal use of fipronil. Millions of fipronil-contaminated eggs have been recalled since the scandal broke.

Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.  communicated by: ProMED-mail \"Caprine arthritis-encephalitis (CAE) and maedi-visna (MV) are persistent lentivirus infections of goats and sheep. They are often grouped together as the small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLVs). Maedi-visna is also known as ovine progressive pneumonia (OPP). Phylogenetic analyses comparing nucleotide sequences of MV virus (MVV) and CAE virus (CAEV) have demonstrated that these are closely related lentiviruses. One source of CAEV and MVV transmission is colostrum and milk. The source of horizontal transmission in the absence of lactation remains unknown; however, faeces and lung fluids are known to harbour infectious virus. Ovine lentiviruses have been identified in most of the sheep-rearing countries of the world, with the notable exceptions of Australia and New Zealand. The distribution of CAEV is highest in industrialised countries, and seems to have coincided with the international movement of European breeds of dairy goats. Clinical and subclinical MV and CAE are associated with progressive, mononuclear cell inflammatory lesions in the lungs, joints, udder and central nervous system. Indurative mastitis is common in both host species, and its economic significance may be underestimated. Laboured breathing associated with emaciation caused by progressive pneumonitis is the predominant feature in clinically affected sheep, whereas polyarthritis is the main clinical sign in goats. However, most lentivirus-infected sheep and goats are largely asymptomatic, but remain persistent carriers of virus and are capable of transmitting infection via colostrum or milk and respiratory secretions. The most practical and reliable approach to confirming a diagnosis of MV or CAE is a combination of serology and clinical evaluation.\" \"There is no serologic or clinical evidence that humans are susceptible to CAEV.\" ( ). - Mod.CRD   .

Both cases are under investigation to determine whether they meet the Brighton Collaboration case definition for GBS.  Details of the cases  The first case is an elderly male resident of the United States with recent travel to Central America. He developed an acute febrile illness shortly after returning to the U.S. and was subsequently hospitalized in January with progressive ascending weakness of the extremities and diminished reflexes. The patient tested positive for Zika virus infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). He improved following treatment and was ready to be discharged. However, he experienced a sudden subarachnoid haemorrhage due to a ruptured aneurysm and died.  The second case is an adult male resident of Haiti who experienced an acute onset of facial weakness, difficulty swallowing, and numbness of fingers in early January. No antecedent illness was reported. A few days later, he travelled to the United States for additional medical care. Cerebrospinal fluid had elevated protein and normal white blood cells. Physical examination showed mild weakness and diminished reflexes. The patient tested positive for Zika virus infection by serology. He improved with intravenous immunoglobulin therapy and was discharged.  WHO risk assessment  To date, a total of 9 countries or territories have reported an increased incidence of GBS and/or laboratory confirmation of Zika virus infection among GBS cases. This is the first time that a country with no vector borne transmission of Zika virus detects patients with concomitant GBS and Zika virus infection. These cases provide additional evidence of a possible causal relationship between Zika virus and GBS. Further investigations are needed to understand the implications of pre-existing dengue infections, together with recent Zika infections, in the pathogenesis of GBS.  It is likely that countries that are currently reporting autochthonous Zika virus transmission will face a rise in the number of GBS cases in the coming months. However, it is critical to ensure that in all these countries the reported increases in the incidence of GBS are the result of a real change rather than enhanced surveillance. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessment based on the latest available information.  WHO advice  WHO recommends Member States affected or susceptible to Zika virus outbreaks to:  monitor the incidence and trends of neurological disorders, especially GBS, to identify variations against their expected baseline values;  develop and implement sufficient patient management protocols to manage the additional burden on health care facilities generated by a sudden increase in patients with Guillain-Barre Syndrome;  raise awareness among health care workers and establish and/or strengthen links between public health services and clinicians in the public and private sectors.  The proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for Zika virus infection. Prevention and control relies on reducing the breeding of mosquitoes through source reduction (removal and modification of breeding sites) and reducing contact between mosquitoes and people. This can be achieved by reducing the number of natural and artificial water-filled habitats that support mosquito larvae, reducing the adult mosquito populations around at-risk communities and by using barriers such as insect screens, closed doors and windows, long clothing and repellents. Since the Aedes mosquitoes (the primary vector for transmission) are day-biting mosquitoes, it is recommended that those who sleep during the daytime, particularly young children, the sick or elderly, should rest under mosquito nets (bed nets), treated with or without insecticide to provide protection.  During outbreaks, space spraying of insecticides may be carried out following the technical orientation provided by WHO to kill flying mosquitoes. Suitable insecticides (recommended by the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme) may also be used as larvicides to treat relatively large water containers, when this is technically indicated.  Basic precautions for protection from mosquito bites should be taken by people traveling to high risk areas, especially pregnant women. These include use of repellents, wearing light colored, long sleeved shirts and pants and ensuring rooms are fitted with screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering.  Based on the current available information, WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions to the United States of America.

Pointing out that carcasses of infected monkeys found in Goa's hinterlands have mostly been of the langoor species, officials say that a systematic study with a database of the same is thus required to evaluate this phenomenon. As many as 82 human cases of KFD or monkey fever have been registered in the state from January to June, this year 2017. The incidence of disease, however, appears less menacing in the face of 3 deaths and 284 cases in 2016; it is slowly spreading to other talukas. In 2015, when the disease was 1st detected in Goa, it was limited to Sattari taluka. The following year, a few cases were detected in Dharbandora, while this year 2017, 5 persons from Pernem taluka were detected with the virus. There are no figures, however, of the source of this disease, i.e. the monkeys. Forest officials, however, stated that of the 2 monkey species in Goa, only one was seen dying of the infection. \"There are 2 species of monkeys in Goa: Macacque and the Langoor. We have noticed that the monkey carcasses have only been of the langoor species. However, we require a systematic study with database to review this,\" an official said. Sources in the department urged that a body of experts appointed by the high court is required to provide scientifically-backed data. \"These monkeys are very social animals and move in groups. We cannot identify the disease by sight on a particular monkey, but since their ticks are the main carriers of the disease, we can assume that the entire group can be infected if even one of them has it. There should be continuous observation and analysis over a period of time to arrive at a conclusion,\" they said. The disease is caused by a virus belonging to the family Flaviviridae, which also includes yellow fever and dengue fever. The symptoms of the disease include a high fever with frontal headaches, followed by haemorrhagic symptoms, such as bleeding from the nasal cavity, throat, and gums, as well as gastrointestinal bleeding. Other symptoms include vomiting, muscle stiffness, tremors, absent reflexes, and mental disturbances Dobler, Gerhard (2010). \"Zoonotic tick-borne flaviviruses.\" Veterinary Microbiology. 140 (3/4): 221-228.

There will be muscle aches and weakness during this period, and the affected person is unable to engage in physical activities. Prophylaxis by vaccination, as well as preventive measures like protective clothing, tick control, and mosquito control are advised. The vaccine for KFDV consists of formalin-inactivated KFDV. The vaccine has a 62.4 percent effectiveness rate for individuals who receive 2 doses. For individuals who receive an additional dose, the effectiveness increases to 82. \"Coverage and Effectiveness of Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) Vaccine in Karnataka, South India, 2005-10.\" Plos Neglected Tropical Diseases. 7 (1): 1-4. Specific treatments are not available. Vaccination with formalin-inactivated tissue-culture vaccine has been the primary strategy for controlling KFD. The strategy involves mass vaccination in areas reporting KFD activity (i.e., laboratory evidence of KFD virus KFDV in monkeys, humans, or ticks) and in villages within a 5-km radius of such areas Directorate of Health and Family Welfare Services, Government of Karnataka, 2005 manual on Kyasanur Forest disease; unpub. data. Two vaccine doses are administered at least one month apart to persons 7-65 years of age. Vaccine-induced immunity is short-lived, so the 1st booster dose of vaccine is recommended within 6-9 months after primary vaccination; thereafter, annual booster doses are recommended for 5 years after the last confirmed case in the area  . - Mod.UBA   .

The _Aedes albopictus_, or Asian tiger mosquito as it's commonly known, is one type of mosquito that can spread Zika. It was discovered in Dane County, and only 3 of that type were found. \"It was only 3 mosquitoes that we've been able to detect,\" said University of Wisconsin-Madison entomologist Susan Paskewitz. \"And we went back out to the same location and have looked and just haven't been finding them. So at the end of the summer I might say something different after we've looked in more places and had longer to see if this represents an opportunity for these mosquitoes to get more of a foothold.\" Paskewitz said it's not surprising to find this specific mosquito; surrounding states such have _A. albopictus_, but the mosquitoes tend to die off. \"Minnesota, for example, has reported them 17 different times and not a single time have they persisted. They seem to be introduced from other places, but they're not likely to get to any high population level that would cause us problems, at least in the near term.\" State health officials say Zika is primarily spread by another mosquito, the _A. aegypti_, which lives in warmer climates. That mosquito has not been found in Wisconsin or any neighboring states. Wisconsin has had 67 confirmed cases of Zika since 2016. All are travel-related; none of the infections were locally acquired. Byline: Shamane Mills  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ Although most of the new localities in which _Aedes albopictus_ has been detected have been in California, the species has been extending its known range northward and recently has been found in Nebraska, Connecticut, Indiana, Ohio, Minnesota, and now, Wisconsin. Unlike _A. aegypti_, _A. albopictus_ eggs can go into diapause and withstand freezing winter temperatures. However, as University of Wisconsin-Madison entomologist Susan Paskewitz points out above, viable populations of this species have not yet become established in these northern states. While most reports identify _A. albopictus_ as vectors of dangerous tropical and subtropical viruses such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, no mention is made about their potential role as vectors of viruses that are of public health concern in temperate zones in the eastern USA  La Crosse and Jamestown Canyon. It has been shown in the laboratory that this mosquito species is susceptible to infection by both of these orthobunyaviruses. Dual infections by both of these viruses can result in reassortment of the 3 RNA strands, with all 6 reassortants produced. These 2 viruses can co-circulate in the same woodlands in places like southwestern Wisconsin. Should _A. albopictus_ become established in ecosystems where these 2 viruses are endemic, the emergence of new, reassorted viruses is possible. - Mod.TY ", "dates": ["Date: Mon 17 Jul 2017 11:06 PM CDT", "The Wisconsin Department of Health Services reported [Mon 17 Jul 2017]", "Wisconsin has had 67 confirmed cases of Zika since 2016"], "title": "Invasive mosquito - USA (04): (WI) "}, "511": {"sentences": "   Mon 28 Aug 2017, 8:19 PM WIB Source: Regional Kompas in Indonesian, trans.

Cow carcasses are feared will spread the bacteria to humans and can also kill more cows. \"We have received reports of the cow's death in Tumbuo Village,\" said Vivi Tayeb, Head of Animal Health and Veterinary Public Health, Gorontalo district on Mon 28 Aug 2017. After receiving the report, Vivi Tayeb and the team headed straight for the village on the outskirts of Lake Limboto to conduct the examination. The results of examination of dozens of cows showed they were affected by anthrax. \"We immediately did the vaccinations so the infection will notspread to other cows,\" said Vivi Tayeb. Vivi explained that as many as 2560 head of cattle in Dusun Tumbuo have been vaccinated. This number will continue to grow until all the cows in Gorontalo District are vaccinated. Vivi added that an outbreak of anthrax, also took place last year 2016 at which time several cows were suddenly found dead. A number of people were skeptical and still ate anthrax infected cows; as a result, they were rushed to the hospital after contracting anthrax. There are allegations that more than 25 cows died this week because of anthrax.

The children were never vaccinated, and people of the area have not received any health service whatsoever from the government, said officials of the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) at a press conference yesterday Mon 17 Jul 2017. Prof Abul Kalam Azad, director general of the DGHS, said the authorities became certain by the test results of blood and serum samples from the affected children that they had been infected by measles. \"They the deceased children were suffering from malnutrition too, which caused the disease to take a serious turn,\" he said at the conference held at the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR). The deaths could have been prevented if the children were given proper treatment, he said, apologising for the sad and irreversible event. Meanwhile, one more child, from Sonachori union, was hospitalised yesterday Mon 17 Jul 2017, reports our correspondent from Chittagong. With the latest one, the number of hospitalised children having similar symptoms rose to 88. Of them, 53 have been receiving treatment at Chittagong Medical College Hospital (CMCH) while the rest at Bangladesh Institute of Tropical and Infectious Disease (BITID) in Fouzderhat. A medical team from Dhaka went there and collected blood and serum samples from the affected children. At the press conference, the director general, accompanied by a WHO medical officer, assured that no one else would be infected with the virus since a temporary centre had been set up in the affected area to conduct an immunisation programme. About Tripura Para having been left out of the government's vaccination campaign, Prof Azad said the vaccination programme was on as per a \"micro plan\" at the ward level, but somehow Tripura Para, a small area resided by 85 families, remained out of the coverage. \"Now we have decided to overhaul the whole micro-plan system at the village level,\" to check if any small area is out of the immunisation programme, he said, adding that a committee would be formed to find out the people responsible for the exclusion of the area. All the children receiving treatment now are between 1 and 12 years. The symptoms include fever, rash, breathing problems, vomiting, and blood in stool, said Azizur Rahman Siddique, civil surgeon of Chittagong.  <br><br>Communicated by: EpiCore Global Surveillance Project ProMED is grateful to the Epicore member who submitted report 2 as a response to \"Undiagnosed illness - Bangladesh: (CG) fatal, children, RFI http://promedmail.org/post/20170713.5172943\", in such a timely manner. It is sad to learn the children still die from a vaccine-preventable disease. Certainly, malnutrition and reduced access to health care services contributed to the severity of the disease presentation. Case fatality rates of 5 to 25 percent are common in developing countries in contrast to the less than 1 percent case fatality rate in the United States during the epidemic of 1989  1990. In the developing world, epidemiologic factors associated with severe measles include younger age, overcrowding, poor access to care, pre-existing medical conditions, and malnutrition. Because these factors frequently coexist in the developing world, the relative contribution of each to measles morbidity is unclear. However, malnutrition has been implicated in increased morbidity and mortality of childhood measles most markedly and repeatedly. Responding to malnutrition is imperative. The ability to treat and prevent malnutrition has been transformed in recent years by strategies relying on ready-to-use therapeutic and supplementary foods. Most children with severe malnutrition can now be treated by caregivers at home. Furthermore, lack of access to health care and limited medical capacity dramatically reduces the chances for treatment once the disease is apparent. It appears from the report that vaccination and access to medical care are being addressed by the government in this remote area now.<br><br><strong> References </strong><br> 1. Cabrol JC.

Nicolerta Bellio, MSF medical coordinator, disclosed this in a statement issued in Maiduguri, the state capital. Bellio said the highly contagious disease, which infiltrated the camp from Niger, spread through Ngala camp due to a combination of poor living conditions and flooding. According to Bellio, the camp shelters some 45 000 people who have fled violence stemming from the conflict between Boko Haram and the military. Bellio said that given the poor living conditions in the camp, it was a surprise that the number of cases had not escalated, or even led to an outbreak of cholera. \"The situation in Ngala is very worrying. The onset of the rainy season has caused repeated flooding in the camp, and water gushes across pathways, latrine holes and into people's shelters,\" Bellio said. \"When it rains, the whole camp gets covered in mud and dirty water. This is a recipe for spreading bacteria and disease, particularly as people don't always use the latrines that have been installed in the camp, so wastewater washes out everywhere. There have been more than 400 cases of hepatitis E in the past 2 months, and we have treated 170 patients at our hospital, so it's no surprise that an outbreak of hepatitis E has been declared.\" Bellio also spoke of the dangers of the disease to pregnant women and instructed people on how to avoid the disease. \"Generally, people recover from hepatitis E if they receive treatment, but the disease can be very dangerous for pregnant women and their unborn babies,\" he said. \"Hepatitis E leads to high rates of spontaneous abortions and stillbirths, as well as babies being born prematurely.

Roanne Nono of the ZCRC community relations service on Wed 2 Aug 2017 disclosed that 208 inmates, all males, were tested positive of TB. Nono said they were among the 384 inmates suspected to be afflicted with TB. The others are still undergoing confirmatory tests. Nono said these are on top of the 7 old cases of TB and another 7 cases of multi-drug resistant MDR TB they detected at the ZCRC. She said among the measures to stop the spread of the disease is the isolation of the inmates afflicted with TB. TB is an infectious disease caused by bacterium _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. It generally affects the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. Tuberculosis is spread through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough, spit, speak, or sneeze. Nono said they also imposed strict observance of proper hygiene among the inmates.

Factors that encourage the spread of TB in prisons also promote the spread of MDR forms.\" If compared with other affected community at large, the time spent in detention center may be enough to complete the whole course of TB treatment by decreasing the rate of defaulters. - Mod.ST The news article above says that the prisoners \"were tested positive of TB\", but fails to say what type of testing was done. Presumably, these prisoners had clinical pulmonary tuberculous disease and sputum cultures grew _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ or the diagnosis was confirmed by molecular testing methods. It would be helpful to know if this was a common source outbreak, which could be confirmed by genotyping the clinical isolates to determine if any of the strains had matching genotypes.

The CDC released an investigation notice about the outbreak of the _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhimurium strain, which was also linked to infections in microbiology labs in 2011 and 2014. The infections occurred in clinical, commercial, college, and university microbiology laboratories in California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Missouri, North Carolina, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Texas, and Washington. Those affected ranged in age from less than a year to 57 years old. Salmonellosis can cause diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps. Though most people recover without treatment, severe cases can require antimicrobials or hospitalization. Those with impaired immune systems, as well as the elderly and infants, are at greater risk of severe illness from salmonellosis. The CDC estimates that 380 people die and a million become ill from salmonellosis each year. In response to previous lab-related outbreaks, the CDC released a set of guidelines for students, employees, and faculty members to use when working in microbiology laboratories. It includes not bringing home items used in the lab; following proper biosafety training; wearing gloves, a lab coat or other protective garments; actively washing hands; and avoiding touching your face or body while in the lab. Several people infected in the latest outbreak reported risky behaviors, such as not wearing gloves, not washing hands, and using writing utensils or notebooks outside the laboratory. Those working in laboratories should also be aware of the signs and symptoms of salmonella infection and see a health care provider if they believe they may be infected, the CDC says. It is also important to note that not only laboratory workers can get sick; people who live with them are also vulnerable. Byline: Victoria Knight  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\.

Recently, there has been a large increase in the number of dengue cases in Vietnam, according to a World Health Organization (WHO) report. As of August 2017, more than 80,000 cases have been reported. Although most cases have been reported in the south, there has been a sharp increase in cases in the north, especially in Hanoi.  Dengue is spread through mosquito bites and can cause symptoms such as fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, rash, and pain in the eyes, joints, and muscles.  What can travelers do to prevent dengue?  Because mosquitoes transmit dengue to people, travelers to Vietnam should protect themselves against mosquito bites to avoid getting the illness.

Japanese encephalitis is a viral disease spread by blood-sucking insects, particularly mosquitoes. The mosquitoes of the _Culex_ species are known to be the viral carriers. The DOH said it affects the nervous system, causes severe complications and even death. The disease can infect not only humans but domestic animals, birds, bats, snakes, and frogs as well. Among the symptoms of Japanese encephalitis, according to the DOH, are flu-like illnesses, fever, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, and tiredness. The symptoms usually appear 6-8 days after the mosquito bite. If untreated, patients could suffer brain damage or paralysis as it also affects the spinal cord. In 30 percent of the cases, death could occur. Young children are more vulnerable due to their weak immune system. While there is no cure, the virus could be prevented through vaccination. A separate report from the World Health Organization (WHO) said that Japanese encephalitis is an illness that is endemic in the Philippines and is fatal in almost 3 out of 10 serious cases. The WHO report also said that nearly all survivors of this mosquito-borne disease experience permanent damage, including physical disabilities, cognitive and language problems, learning disabilities and behavioral problems. Byline: Ian Ocampo Flora  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail This is a cluster of Japanese encephalitis in central Luzon Island. Clusters have been relatively rare in the Philippines. There have been relatively few reports of human Japanese encephalitis (JE) cases in the Philippines in recent years, although the islands are within the JE virus endemic zone. Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable encephalitis in Asia and the western Pacific. It is caused by a virus transmitted by culicine mosquitoes. Ardeid birds (including herons) are the reservoir species in nature. Most human infections are asymptomatic or result in only mild symptoms. However, a small percentage of infected persons develop encephalitis, with symptoms including sudden onset of headache, high fever, disorientation, coma, tremors, and convulsions. About 1 in 4 encephalitis cases is fatal. Apparently, none of the cases in the report above died. There is no specific treatment for JE. Patient management focuses on supportive care and management of complications. Steps to prevent JE virus infections include vaccination and use of personal protective measures to prevent mosquito bites. - Mod.TY ", "dates": ["Date: Fri 18 Aug 2017"], "title": "Japanese encephalitis - Philippines: (PM) "}, "460": {"sentences": "   Tue 8 Aug 2017 Source: The Japan Times edited The number of patients suffering from tick-borne diseases, some of which are life-threatening, is increasing at a rapid pace this year 2017, prompting alarm among medical experts. In particular, experts have flagged 2 infections for which no vaccines are available, noting that the bites through which they are transmitted are difficult to spot. According to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, tick-borne Japanese spotted fever, which causes high fever and a rash, has already been found in 118 people this year 2017, topping the figure from the same period last year. The health ministry reported a record 276 such cases last year. After an incubation period of 2-8 days, the disease can  in serious cases  cause respiratory failure or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a potentially life-threatening condition in which small blood clots develop throughout the bloodstream. Tick-borne diseases should be considered a potential threat as tick bites often go unnoticed, said Masayuki Saijo, who heads one of several virology departments at the NIID. Most infections have been reported in western Japan, with Mie Prefecture topping the list at around 35 cases per year, according to the institute. But infections have also been confirmed at locations in eastern Japan, such as Tochigi and Niigata prefectures, a sign that the disease is spreading nationwide. Saijo stressed that there is no need to panic, as the disease can be easily treated with antibacterial drugs. Though it affects fewer patients, infections of a more dangerous tick-borne disease  called severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS)  are also increasing. As of 23 Jul 2017, 51 people had already contracted SFTS, which has a fatality rate of up to 30 percent. Of these patients, 5 died. Since the 1st SFTS infection was confirmed in Japan in 2013, 280 people have been infected, of which 58 died, according to the NIID. \"In 50 percent of the cases, tick bites were not detected,\" Saijo said, explaining that ticks tend to migrate to the armpits, groin or hair-covered areas where they are often difficult to notice. \"SFTS doesn't have any specific traits that would make the disease recognizable. It's no different from a cold or stomach flu,\" he said. After an incubation period of 6 days to 2 weeks, SFTS causes fever, nausea, diarrhea and drowsiness, according to the health ministry. The ministry has also reported a case of an indirect infection through a cat that lead to the death of a woman. The woman died from SFTS 10 days after being bitten by a sick stray cat last summer 2016 when she was trying to take it to a veterinary hospital. The ministry believes the cat had been infected with SFTS. No vaccines are available for SFTS or Japanese spotted fever. The NIID's Saijo said that ticks, depending on their type, may also transmit viruses that cause ailments such as Lyme disease, which is seen in central Honshu, or tick-borne encephalitis, confirmed so far only in Hokkaido. The health ministry and the NIID recommend wearing long sleeves and long pants when walking through areas with tall grass in fields or forests. Ticks are active from spring through fall, and the number of reported infections increases during this period, Saijo said. \"The best approach is to avoid being bitten. It's the only way to protect yourself,\" Saijo said. \"If someone has already been bitten, they should seek medical attention to get the appropriate treatment.\" Byline: Magdalena Osumi  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. The causative agent was isolated and named _Rickettsia japonica_. It causes high fever and erythematous nonpruritic skin eruptions over the entire body.

Japanese spotted fever: report of 31 cases and review of the literature. Emerg Infect Dis. 1997 Apr-Jun;3(2):105-11). As noted in earlier posts, SFTS cases have been reported in Japan before. In 2013, the total number of cases came to 8, and while at that time the 1st 5 were all deaths, 3 other people, infected between 2005 and 2012, all recovered. In 2014, SFTS virus infected 53 people and left 21 people dead. SFTS virus has been shown to be tick transmitted. Apparently, the diagnosis of indirect transmission from a cat bite has been laboratory confirmed for the woman, but no mention is made that the cat had a confirmed SFTS infection, leaving doubt about the cat as a source of the woman's infection. SFTS virus is a phlebovirus in the bunyavirus family.

The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, which can transmit viruses like chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever, and Zika, was recently detected in an area of the city bordered by Vista Dunes Lane, West Harland Drive, Via Rosa, and Sun Brook Lane. About 120 homes are within that area, according to the Coachella Valley Riverside county Mosquito and Vector Control District. Starting Mon 28 Aug 2017, district teams will be searching for standing water sources and other breeding sites in residents' yards. Door-to-door inspections will begin on Tue 29 Aug 2017. \"_Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes love your home just as much as you do,\" said Jill Oviatt, district public information manager. \"This mosquito species prefers backyard water sources over other environments and is commonly found laying eggs in saucers of potted plants, soda cans, discarded bottle caps, bird baths, and other manmade sources.\" The mosquitoes were first detected in the Coachella Valley last May 2017, officials said. Following its initial appearance in Coachella, the mosquito has been seen in Indio, Cathedral City, and Palm Springs. However, district officials say \"aggressive surveillance and control activities\" have been successful in reducing its prevalence in Coachella, Indio, and Cathedral City, while spraying applications are ongoing in Palm Springs. Residents are encouraged to drain standing water and install screens on windows and doors in order to keep mosquitoes out. byline: Toni McAllister  communicated by: ProMED-mail This is the 1st report of _Aedes aegypti_ in San Bernardino county this year (2017). _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes were found in Riverside county last year (2016) and in several locations in the county in 2015; this is the 2nd report that ProMED-mail has posted of detection of _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes in the county this year (2017). As noted earlier, finding _Ae. aegypti_ in these counties is not surprising. Both _Ae. aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ have been found in various locations in California over the past 13 years (see archives listed below). Both of them have been detected in southern California in several new locations over the past 1-4 years. Fortunately, few individuals have been trapped in these locations, indicating very small populations that are probably too limited to initiate and sustain ongoing Zika, chikungunya, or dengue virus transmission. Air conditioning and screened windows and doors will help limit their abundance. However, the introduction of these viruses into southern California will continue, so aggressive vector surveillance and control will be important to limit populations of these vectors. - Mod.TY ", "dates": ["Date: Sat 26 Aug 2017 12:41 PM PDT", "Date: Fri 25 Aug 2017", "Starting [Mon 28 Aug 2017] district teams will be searching for", "Door-to-door inspections will begin on [Tue 29 Aug 2017]", "2015; this is the 2nd report that ProMED-mail has posted of detection"], "title": "Invasive mosquito -

The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports that the 61 year old took her grandchildren swimming in the Rappahannock River, a day after her cat had scratched her finger. Durvin says on Mon 24 Jul 2017, she was in the hospital with a swollen, throbbing hand. She says doctors diagnosed her with a vibrio infection. She says by Wed 26 Jul 2017, her middle finger turned \"black and cold\". If antibacterials don't work, the finger may need to be amputated. The Virginia Department of Health says that to avoid contracting vibrio, people with open wounds or compromised immune systems shouldn't swim in salt or brackish water. Infections can also result from eating raw or undercooked seafood, particularly shellfish.  communicated by: ProMED-mail This post does not report if the woman had risk factors for more severe disease due to this organism. A 2015 ProMED-mail post (Vibrio vulnificus - USA (02): (VA) fatality http://promedmail.org/post/20150806.3562336) reported a case of _V. vulnificus_ acquired from the same Virginia river. The following is extracted from the \"Bad Bug Book\", Center for Safety and Applied Nutrition, US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) at  : _Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in salt water, and acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not imply that the water is contaminated by sewage. Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc, followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis. The \"primary septicemia\" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 per cent). Over 70 per cent of infected individuals have distinctive bullous skin lesions (shown at  ). There are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are normal flora in warm salt water (not indicative of any sewage contamination) and that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just get gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ can involve more northern geographical areas if the area is affected by global warming or an isolated substantial heat wave. - Mod.LL   .

Growers contacted Dan Cooley, University of Massachusetts, with new trees dying back. The trees were either completely dead with brown leaves, some were wilting, some had yellow leaves. In a very wet part, the incidents were concentrated. The trees were dug up to be examined further. \"It looks like _Phytophthora_ crown and root rot,\" Cooley said. Soils saturated for more than 24 hours are breeding grounds for _Phytophthora_. There are rootstocks that provide some resistance, such as M.9 and B.9. \"The resistance is conditional on wet weather or wet sites and on how stressed that tree is.\" The plantings that Cooley diagnosed as having _Phytophthora_ were on B.9. \"It was surprising to see that they were getting the disease.\" He suggests growers ensure proper drainage and for young plantings, minimize transplanting shock. byline: Christina Herrick  communicated by: ProMED-mail A range of species of _Phytophthora_ (oomycetes, fungus-like organisms) cause crown, root and collar rots of woody hosts. For apple, the reported species include _P. cactorum_, _cambivora_, _cryptogea_, _megasperma_, and _syringae_. Symptoms usually get more severe over several growth seasons and may include delayed bud break, yellowing of foliage, branch dieback, decline of tree vigour, and sudden death of the host may occur when additional water or environmental stress is imposed. _Phytophthora_ root rot occurs mostly in heavy or waterlogged soils and may be difficult to distinguish from the effects of waterlogging alone. The pathogens are soil borne. They are spread with soil and plant material, by water and mechanical means (often by contaminated equipment and human activities). Disease management is difficult and may include cultural practices (phytosanitary measures, nutritional improvements) and removal or burning of affected plants. Trunk injections with phosphorous compounds have been shown to be effective in some tree species, for example for avocado root rot. The genus includes some of the most destructive pathogens of crops (for example, _P. infestans_, potato late blight) as well as native environments (_P. kernoviae_, _P. ramorum_ in Europe, North America; _P. cinnamomi_ in Australia).

Mod. TY The number of cases of hantavirus infections has risen to 14, since the Ministry of Health confirmed 3 new cases of fever and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. Carlos Mu\u00f1oz, regional coordinator of epidemiology in Los Santos, stated that the 3 latest cases registered are a girl whose illness is yet to be confirmed as hantavirus fever, a 44 year old woman resident of Via Hacia Santo Domingo with hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome admitted yesterday Thu 24 Aug 2017, and a 23 year old young man with hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome.

The agency says the animals were tested after returning to their home farm. The fair took place 4-9 Jul 2017. Veterinarians are asked to be on alert for sick pigs and made aware that pigs showing clinical signs of illness are not allowed at fairs and shows. DATCP officials say they were not aware of any human illnesses as a result of the incident, though swine influenza can be zoonotic. Because of their proximity, the Dane County Fair, Green County Fair, RockCounty Fair and Waukesha County Fair all fall within the 30 day validity period for a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection if pigs were shown at the Stoughton Fair. State Veterinarian Dr Paul McGraw reminds all veterinarians to examine the whole herd of origin prior to issuing a CVI in the event some pigs on the farm are ill, even if they are not the pigs going to the show. \"Exhibitors who showed pigs at the Stoughton Fair should closely monitor their pigs for signs of swine influenza,\" McGraw said. \"Influenza can spread whenever animals or people congregate, and fairs are no exception. While rare, influenza A viruses can spread from people to pigs and from pigs to people.\" If pigs are showing signs, owners should contact their veterinarian for an evaluation even if they have a valid CVI issued within 30 days and if they exhibited at the Stoughton Fair.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. The 1st paragraph of this report is temporally confused as to whether these pigs were sampled while at the fair or after their return to their home farms.

Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick were submitted to Atlantic Veterinarian College in P.E.I. A necropsy was done on a number of them and the findings, together with the clinical symptoms, indicate trichomonosis,\" wrote Fiep de Bie, a wildlife technician with the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative, in an email. He notes the autopsies are not yet complete but the findings so far prompted the society to make a statement. \"Considering the videos, pictures and telephone conversations, plus the preliminary necropsies reports, we believe it is safe to say that this is what we are dealing with,\" David Currie, president of the Nova Scotia Bird Society, wrote in the post. \"Plus, it is certainly more widespread and therefore a significant outbreak. It started earlier than usual, possibly due to the warm weather we experienced early in the summer.\" He said it's possible the parasite can be passed on through hummingbird feeders, but it would be low risk. Currie advised that the practice of continuing with suet  a combination of animal fat and other ingredients to attract some birds  is not a good idea. \"Summer has no shortage of available protein and fat, so take it down. These suet cakes often have seeds encased that fall to the ground to attract infected and uninfected birds.\" He said sprinkling food on the ground is an easy way to spread the parasite, and that birdbaths should also be taken in. \"We are asking people to consider removing seed feeders until colder weather is upon us. I fully realize how much people love to see the bird life in their yards but birds do not become dependent on your feeders,\" he wrote. \"In winter, conservation of energy is important and having regular food sources has a benefit.

Trichomoniasis has been postulated to be a factor contributing to the extinction of the passenger pigeon _Ectopistes migratorius_ and has been shown to be a significant cause of nestling mortality in the island-endemic pink pigeon _Nesoenas mayeri_ and in the Iberian Peninsula population of the Bonelli's eagle _Hieraaetus fasciatus_.

northern Tanzania </strong><br> The DTRA Defense Threat Reduction Agency CBEP Cooperative Biological Engagement Program-funded (HDTRA1-16-1-0005) Bushmeat Biosecurity Research (BBR) Project team at the Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology (NM-AIST) in Arusha, Tanzania, has been coordinating with multiple partners to monitor anthrax (_Bacillus anthracis_) outbreaks in northern Tanzania since October 2016. Here we report on several outbreak responses with which we were involved both in verification and remediation. In November 2016, a suspected outbreak of anthrax was reported in the Selela ward of Monduli district, located in the northeastern part of Arusha region, Tanzania, affecting both wildlife and livestock. The BBR group was part of a response team including wildlife veterinarians, ecologists, and microbiologists, along with technical staff and competent authorities from various government and non-governmental organizations, including representatives of health ministries that performed a thorough investigation on this outbreak. The response team recorded mortality of 109 wildebeest, 21 gazelles, and 1 hare from observed carcasses, and 10 cattle, 26 goats, and 3 sheep reported by community members to have died. Livestock carcasses were not directly observed because they had been consumed by the owners, and the investigating team found that wildlife carcasses had also been butchered for human consumption. Additionally, the team found that skins from the affected livestock and butchered wildlife were being used as bedding, and tails of the wildebeest were being used as fly swats. Blood and tissues samples collected from the wild animal carcasses confirmed the presence of _B. anthracis_ in smears, as well as by real-time PCR analyses for the presence of capsule and toxin genes. Additional analyses confirmed the presence of nucleic acid signatures of virulent _B. anthracis_ spores in soil samples that were collected near the sites of the animal carcasses. There were also several verified reports of human cases being admitted to the health centers with skin lesions associated with contact and consumption of dead animals. On 20 May 2017 the team received reports of suspected cases of anthrax causing wildlife deaths in the West Kilimanjaro area of Hai district. The team responded and were able to collect samples from tissue, ticks, and soil with body fluids from 2 zebra (_Equus quagga_; common zebra) that had died in the last 2-3 days, and also soil from the decomposition patch of an elephant (_Loxodonta africana_; African bush elephant) that had died in February 2017. Additional reports indicated that at least 2 waterbuck (_Kobus ellipsiprymnus_) had died from unknown causes in the past 2 months, but the exact causes of death and geographical coordinates of these carcasses were not established. Based on previous outbreaks in the area, and observations of the dying animals, anthrax (_B. anthracis_) was suspected as the cause of death. DNA was extracted from the samples using DNeasy PowerSoil Kit (cat. no. 12888-100), after which extracted DNA was analyzed using quantitative PCR (qPCR) targeting both pX01 and pX02 plasmids. Anthrax was positively confirmed from soil collected at one of the zebra carcass sites. Additional soil, tick, and tissue samples from both zebra carcass sites were positive for either pX01 or pX02, but not both, and no positives were found at the elephant carcass site. On 13 Jun 2017, the Bushmeat Biosecurity Research Laboratory at NM-AIST also was informed of another potential outbreak in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA) in which both livestock, especially sheep and goats, and wildlife (elephant) were implicated. The BBR team investigating the outbreak found that the wildlife veterinary unit under the NCA had already burned the elephant carcasses and vegetation in the surrounding area. The BBR lab did however receive tissue, blood, and fluid swab samples from 2 elephants suspected to have died from anthrax that were collected prior to burning the carcasses. The samples were analyzed using the methods above. Results showed that blood and body fluid samples from one of the elephant carcasses were positive for both pX01 and pX02, and therefore considered positive for _B. anthracis_. While surveying the area, the BBR investigating team further found that there have been several anthrax cases involving humans from different locations within the NCA. In each case, the affected individuals had been in direct contact with, or had consumed dead livestock, and the most prominent symptoms observed were skin lesions suggestive of _B. anthracis_ infection. These cases included the deaths of 4 people (a 2- and 7-year-old boy, 51-year-old man, and a 58-year-old woman). The team observed that the children were the most affected likely because young boys and girls and their mothers are responsible for skinning/processing any dead sheep or goat, while adult males are involved primarily in the butchering of dead cattle. Where possible, the team collected samples from the hides of the livestock that died and were consumed, whose owners developed skin lesions. Analyses of these samples for confirmation of _B. anthracis_ is underway. In general, the team observed a strong association with reported cases occurring on intensively grazed areas, near to watering points during extended draught prevailing in the region. This finding was consistent with suggested necessary environmental conditions favorable to anthrax outbreaks including previous history of the disease occurrence, prolonged periods of grazing different animal species on the same locations leading to grazing very close to the soil surface in heavily-degraded areas, particularly near available water. The conditions of prolonged drought in the region associated with overgrazing and atypical migration patterns drives sporadic anthrax cases in livestock and wildlife. Drought further increases food insecurity, increasing the likelihood that both wildlife and livestock carcasses will be butchered for human consumption, while products such as hides may be used over much longer periods, both leading to increased risk of human infections. While there are confirmed cases of anthrax in wildlife, due to the vast areas of wildlife habitat and the decreased likelihood of carcasses being observed before being scavenged, wildlife cases are likely under-reported. Coordinated efforts are underway to minimize the risks associated with future outbreaks, and currently the NCA authority has procured about 22 000 doses of anthrax vaccines for a mass vaccination of livestock.<br><br><strong> Impact </strong><br> Anthrax still occurs endemically in most wildlife areas in sub-Sahara Africa, and there have been a number of cases of anthrax in livestock and humans reported on ProMED see also below and in the local news since October 2016. Where humans, livestock, and wildlife coexist in northern Tanzania's extensive wildlife interface areas, infections are likely to be experienced by all groups. Furthermore, increasing climate variability and land conversion has led to both increasing overlap of wildlife and livestock on remaining grazing areas, and increasing land degradation of these areas due to intensive grazing, thereby creating ideal conditions for anthrax emergence. Interventions to prevent disease in wild animals begin with minimizing risk factors associated with a particular disease condition and responding to the warning signs that can be learned from previous experiences or from subsequent outbreaks. For example, prolonged droughts or rains are useful predictors of disease occurrence that could guide risk-based surveillance. Steps to reduce zoonotic transmission of anthrax to humans should include: 1. Identification and localization of the source of the outbreak. 2. Establishment of regular and comprehensive disease surveillance, involving a multi-sector \"one-health\" approach. 3. Community education cautioning against consumption of meat and the harvesting of animal products such as skins and tails from wildlife or livestock that have died due to unknown causes. 4. Harmonization of Standard Operating Procedures in anthrax surveillance and diagnosis between stakeholders and district diagnostic laboratories, including: - Kilimanjaro Clinical Research Institute (KCRI)/University of Glasgow (UK); - Tanzania Wildlife Research Institute (TAWIRI); - Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism (MNRT) - Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology (NM_AIST) - Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) - Tanzania Veterinary Laboratory Agency (TVLA) - Tanzania National Parks Authority (TANAPA) - Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority (NCAA)  Eblate Ernest Mjingo Tanzania Wildlife Research Institute (TAWIRI) Thanks to Eblate for so clearly spelling out their surveillance problems for anthrax in northern Tanzania. With extensive national parks and minimal infrastructure their situation is difficult at best. Over the years we have got the resolution down to 1 sq km, and it is even better when limited to specific genomic strains local to the area of interest (see Mullins JC, Garofolo G, Van Ert M, et al.

Zika virus (or Zika) has been reported in the Turks and Caicos Islands. Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in the Turks and Caicos Islands are infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:  Women who are pregnant:  Do not travel to the Turks and Caicos Islands.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to the Turks and Caicos Islands or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers considering pregnancy:  Before you or your partner travel, talk to your health care provider about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection.  Wait before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.  If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex &ndash; or do not have sex &ndash; for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex, or do not have sex, for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy  Talk to your health care provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you&rsquo;re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Wait at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  Men are advised to wait longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.gov  Contact CDC  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  1600 Clifton Road  Atlanta ,  GA  30329-4027  USA  800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)  Contact CDC-INFO  TOP", "dates": [" Page created: August 03 2016", " Page last updated: August 08 2017", " Page last reviewed: August 08 2017", " 30329-4027", " 800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)"], "title": ["Zika Virus in Turks and Caicos Islands"]}, "163": {"sentences": " Magill Partners GeoSentinel Global TravEpiNet Mobile Apps RSS Feeds  Measles in Indonesia  Recommend on Facebook  Tweet  Share Compartir  Warning - Level 3, Avoid Nonessential Travel  Alert - Level 2, Practice Enhanced Precautions  Watch - Level 1, Practice Usual Precautions  What is the current situation?  Health officials in Australia, Canada, and Taiwan have reported several cases of measles in travelers returning from Indonesia, including the island of Bali.  Measles is found regularly in Indonesia , and CDC recommends that travelers to Indonesia protect themselves by making sure they are vaccinated against measles. Getting measles vaccine is particularly important for infants 6&ndash;11 months of age (1 dose of measles vaccine) and children 1 year of age or older (2 doses of measles vaccine). Clinicians should keep measles in mind when treating patients with fever and rash, especially if the patient has recently traveled internationally.  What can travelers do to protect themselves?

Many mosquitoes feed during the dusk or dawn hours, but the _Aedes aegypti_, most commonly known as the yellow fever mosquito, is a daylight-hour insect capable of transmitting several viruses, including Zika, yellow fever, dengue and chikungunya, according to a news release. Officials said there haven't been any reports of illness due to this type of mosquito, but the vector control district will be conducting \"intensive surveillance\" in areas surrounding the place they discovered this insect, including door-to-door inspections for mosquitoes and sources of standing water where they can breed. Officials \"will take appropriate measures to eliminate mosquitoes and mosquito larval sources.\" Byline: Doug Saunders  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. aegypti_ mosquitoes were found in Riverside county last year (2016) and in several locations in the county in 2015, this is the 1st report that ProMED-mail has posted of detection of _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes in the county this year 2017. As noted earlier, finding _Aedes aegypti_ in this county is not surprising. Both _Aedes aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ have been found in various locations in California over the past 13 years (see archives listed below). Both of them have been detected in southern California in several new locations over the past 1-3 years. Fortunately, few individuals have been trapped in these locations, indicating very small populations that are probably too limited to initiate and sustain ongoing Zika, chikungunya or dengue virus transmission.

In April 6 Apr 2017 as well as in May 9 May 2017, one outbreak was detected each in birds kept in captivity. Thus, the HPAI epidemic seems to be waning in Germany. However, outbreaks or infections in wild birds are sporadically reported. The current avian flu epidemic is the most severe and longest-lasting epidemic that has occurred in Europe so far. In total, 29 European states have been or still are concerned. In addition to H5N8, 2 other HPAI subtypes have been detected in Europe, i.e. HPAI H5N5 (in 7 states) and H5N6 (in Greece). Outside Europe, avian influenza outbreaks of the subtype HPAI H5N8 have been reported from Russia, Israel, Egypt, Tunisia, Nigeria, Uganda, Cameroon, Iran, Nepal, and India. HPAI H5N1 is endemic in Asia and some African countries. Moreover, further HPAIV H5N1 related H5-strains are circulating in Asia. Although the current epidemic seems to be waning, isolated outbreaks may still occur. The recent reports of HPAIV cases in birds kept in captivity, which occurred in May 2017, indicate that, at least in some countries, infectious virus is still circulating in the environment. Therefore, biosecurity measures should be maintained. These include, inter alia, wearing of stable specific protective clothing and footwear, cleaning and disinfection of equipment that has been in contact with birds, and the best possible prevention of contacts between poultry and wild birds. So far and worldwide, none of the HPAIV subtypes circulating in Europe (H5N8, H5N5, and H5N6) have caused infections in humans;\"  . - Mod.CRD   .

On Tue 29 Aug 2017, Dr Rene Bagamasbad, Laguna health officer, said the victims were a 9-year-old boy in Calauan town and a 6-year-old boy in San Pablo City. He said the children died around 2 weeks ago. Calauan and San Pablo City, being adjacent to each other, were also placed under investigation by the health office. Only the Calauan case has so far reached the Calabarzon office of the Department of Health, according to Dr Rio Magpantay, DOH regional director. The regional office, however, had also started monitoring \"signs and symptoms\" of possible Japanese encephalitis incidence in other parts of Laguna. Calabarzon stands for the provinces of Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, and Quezon. The disease, which is transmitted by the _Culex_ mosquito, commonly causes abdominal pains, fever, and seizures. It may also cause a part of the brain to swell. Vaccines are available. But there is no cure yet for the disease. Vaccines are currently not part of the government's immunization program. Magpantay said there was no declaration of an outbreak. But the DOH regional office would strengthen the surveillance of communities and hospitals. It usually takes some time to confirm a case of Japanese encephalitis because specimens, such as the patient's blood sample, would have to be collected and submitted for testing at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine in Muntinlupa in Metro Manila.

There have been relatively few reports of human Japanese encephalitis (JE) cases in the Philippines in recent years, although the islands are within the JE virus endemic zone. The report above is of 2 cases. Also on Luzon Island this year (2017), the Department of Health (DOH) has recorded a total of 149 cases of JE with at least 22 cases in noted Pampanga, the highest in the Central Luzon region (see Japanese encephalitis - Philippines: (PM) http://promedmail.org/post/20170818.5257940). A report from the World Health Organization (WHO) said that JE is an illness that is endemic in the Philippines and is fatal in almost 3 out of 10 serious cases. The report also said that nearly all survivors of this mosquito-borne disease experience permanent damage, including physical disabilities, cognitive and language problems, learning disabilities and behavioral problems. - Mod.TY ", "dates": ["Date: Tue 29 Aug 2017 5:19 PM PHT", "On [Tue 29 Aug 2017] Dr Rene Bagamasbad Laguna health officer said", "has recorded a total of 149 cases of JE with at least 22 cases in", "org/post/20170818", "5257940)"], "title": "Japanese encephalitis - Philippines (02): (LG) "}, "66": {"sentences": "   Fri 18 Aug 2017 Source: India Times edited In the early hours of Fri 18 Aug 2017, 17 people, including 5 children, were taken ill after chlorine gas leakage from a cylinder at a waterworks unit of Uttarakhand Jal Sansthan in Dehradun. Police rushed to the spot immediately and threw the leaking cylinder into the water to neutralise it, SP (City) Pradeep Kumar Rai, told PTI. People living in the waterworks area including children, mostly sleeping at that hour, were rushed to different hospitals in the city after they complained of difficulty in breathing and some of them especially children even fainted, the SP (city) said. Altogether 17 people were hospitalized: 8 were admitted in Mahanth Indresh hospital, 5 in Max Hospital, and 4 in CMI hospital, the SP said. However, all of them are out of danger with a majority already discharged from hospitals, he said. The Managing Director of Jan Sansthan said an inquiry is being conducted into the gas leak at the waterworks. Where the homes near there? Perhaps above the waterworks unit? How big was the cylinder to cause this kind of problem? These are likely rhetorical questions but answers would provide insight into what really happened. Chlorine gas is a pulmonary irritant with intermediate water solubility that causes acute damage in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Exposure to low concentrations of chlorine for prolonged periods may have destructive effects, as might very short-term exposure to high concentrations. Long-term complications may occur after breathing in high concentrations of chlorine. Complications are more likely to be seen in people who develop severe health problems such as fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema) following the initial exposure. How chlorine works - The extent of poisoning caused by chlorine depends on the amount of chlorine a person is exposed to, how the person was exposed, and the length of time of the exposure. - When chlorine gas comes into contact with moist tissues such as the eyes, throat, and lungs, an acid is produced that can damage these tissues. Immediate signs and symptoms of chlorine exposure During or immediately after exposure to dangerous concentrations of chlorine, the following signs and symptoms may develop: - blurred vision; - burning pain, redness, and blisters on the skin if exposed to gas. Skin injuries similar to frostbite can occur if it is exposed to liquid chlorine; - burning sensation in the nose, throat, and eyes; - coughing; - chest tightness; - difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. These may appear immediately if high concentrations of chlorine gas are inhaled, or they may be delayed if low concentrations of chlorine gas are inhaled; - fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema) that may be delayed for a few hours; - nausea and vomiting; - watery eyes; - wheezing Long-term health effects Long-term complications may occur after breathing in high concentrations of chlorine. Complications are more likely to be seen in people who develop severe health problems such as fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema) following the initial exposure.

The National Alert System for Critical Antimicrobial Resistance (CARAlert) identified 1064 bacteria highly resistant to last-line antibiotics between 17 Mar 2016 and 31 Mar 2017 across 73 laboratories. \"These are super-superbugs,\" said Professor John Turnidge, senior medical advisor at the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care, which oversees CARAlert. \"They're the bugs we can't afford to let get out of hand,\" he said. The early warning system for the potentially dangerous spread of the critically antimicrobial-resistant bugs (CARs) found that a strain of a gonorrhoeae-causing bacterium  _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_  was the most frequently reported and most stubborn superbug between December 2016 and March 2017, according to the program's 1st publicly available report, to be released on Wednesday 19 Jul 2017. The rise of the resilient bacterium, combined with a rise in gonorrhoea cases nationally, leaves patients with no effective treatment options and aids the spread of the sexually transmitted infection, Professor Turnidge said. The antibiotic azithromycin had become close to useless against the strain, which accounted for almost two thirds of all superbugs detected in February and March 2017?, and the number of reports had increased 3-fold in NSW and Western Australia, the Commission found. Azithromycin-resistant _N. gonorrhoeae_ was the most common CAR reported among 15 to 49 year olds. The number of super-superbug detections overall was still relatively low, Professor Turnidge said of the 8 high priority CARS monitored by the surveillance system, including _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _Salmonella_ species, and Enterobacteriaceae. But their emergence meant that \"we are getting close to untreatable infection with these super bugs,\" he warned. \"Not having antibiotics to treat these infections would be a nightmare. It means people will die that don't need to die. At the sharp end, you have patients who develop blood poisoning and septicaemia...these patients get desperately ill and end up in intensive care units,\" he said. Patients who were infected with the \"super-superbugs\" were left scrambling for access to unregistered drugs, most commonly old antimicrobials that had not been used for decades. Overprescribing antibiotics was \"certainly\" fueling the rise of the highly multi-drug resistant infections, as well as poor hygiene and lax infection control in hospitals and nursing homes, Professor Turnidge said. The report also found more than one third of all CAR bugs were from patients in the community rather than hospitals or nursing homes. 70 per cent of all CAR reports were from the 3 most populous states: New South Wales (34 per cent), Victoria (21 per cent) and Queensland (15 per cent). \"What's happening here is happening around the world. Superbugs are endemic in the community and in hospitals. We are no different to other countries alarmed by the risks of the spread of gonorrhea,\" Professor Turnidge said. The CARAlert system, funded by the federal department of health, was \"an extraordinarily valuable extra tool that helps health authorities around Australia pinpoint the emergence of dangerous strains of bacteria with minimal delay,\" Professor Turnidge said. Health authorities and clinicians get weekly notifications from CARALert. But after only a year in operation, it was not yet possible to draw specific conclusions from the data. Sweden was the only other country that used a similar system, Professor Turnidge said. Byline: Kate Aubusson  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\.org/post/20170711.5166294).

their animals following the discovery of the 1st South Carolina case of eastern equine encephalitis EEE in 2017. The case was identified Fri 21 Jul 2017 in a horse from Dillon County, said Boyd Parr, state veterinarian and director of Clemson University Livestock-Poultry Health. Eastern equine encephalitis is a serious, mosquito-borne illness in horses that can also affect humans. In unvaccinated horses, it is almost always fatal. The horse in Dillon County was not known to have been vaccinated and did not survive. The disease will kill 90 percent of exposed, unvaccinated horses. Symptoms usually develop in horses from 2 to 5 days after exposure. These include stumbling, circling, head-pressing, depression or apprehension, weakness of legs, partial paralysis, inability to stand, muscle twitching, or death. A simple vaccine will minimize the risk to horses and other equine species from EEE. \"It can get out of hand if we don't vaccinate horses and control mosquitoes,\" Parr said. \"The best defense for horse owners is to maintain current equine vaccinations for eastern equine encephalitis, West Nile virus, and rabies for their horses.\" South Carolina led the nation in cases of the disease in 2013 with 49 infected horses. Of those, 48 died. None of the horses infected during 2013 had been vaccinated effectively, according to a review of Clemson Livestock-Poultry Health vaccination history. Following that outbreak, increased vaccinations helped reduce the number of cases to 7 in 2014 and 6 a year later. However, 2016 saw another spike in cases, ending the year with 15 infected horses. The EEE virus is maintained in nature through a cycle involving the freshwater swamp mosquito, _Culiseta melanura_, commonly known as the black-tailed mosquito. 2 to 3 days after becoming infected with the virus a mosquito becomes capable of transmitting it. Infected mosquitoes can transmit the disease when they bite horses and humans. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, eastern equine encephalitis is a rare illness in humans. Most persons infected with it have no apparent illness. Severe cases begin with the sudden onset of headache, high fever, chills, and vomiting. People who are concerned should contact their physicians, Parr said. Rains at crucial times across much of South Carolina made conditions favorable for mosquito breeding again this year 2017, Parr said. Any livestock, including horses, that display neurologic signs, such as stumbling, circling, head-pressing, depression, or apprehension, must be reported to the state veterinarian at 803-788-2260 within 48 hours, according to state law. Information on animal diseases and reporting requirements can be found on the Livestock-Poultry Health website at  . Byline: Tom Hallman, Public Service and Agriculture; College of Agriculture, Forestry and Life Sciences  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. This is a virus that normally cycles in birds, especially very young birds, and their preferred mosquitoes. All it needs is a volume of virus and a less picky mosquito, which goes for its next meal in a horse, or a human. It's not too late to get your horses vaccinated, but do not delay.

After detection of Congo virus in the patient, the Health Department has adopted all precautionary measures and directed heads of all the government hospitals in the district to keep a vigilant eye in their respective areas.  communicated by: ProMED-mail The CCHF virus is tickborne and can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. High mortality rates are observed only if there are hemorrhagic manifestations of the disease; in general, up to 80 per cent of infections are asymptomatic (Vorou R, Pierroutsakos IN, Maltezou HC. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. Curr Opin Infect Dis. 2007; 20(5): 495-500; ). The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The above report does not elaborate on the occupational or exposure history of the patients. However, the majority of cases have been reported in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, butchers, veterinarians and on account of exposure in health care facilities among health care workers who are in contact with suspected CCHF cases. The health and veterinary (including entomologists/vector control) sectors need to work together on formulating awareness messages to reach the susceptible groups in the general public, especially the high risk groups, in order minimize exposures. - Mod.UBA   .

The Minister of Livestock and Fisheries James Janga Duku, despite not declaring an outbreak of the viral animal disease in Juba, said they were working on ways to establish control measures at the various border points in the country to curb further infections. \"We are looking for funds to set up control stations and maximum surveillance along our border. And we are doing this alongside our neighboring countries,\" he told journalists in Juba. He added that the FMD which does not kill cattle instantly but reduces the levels of milk and yields threatens to affect the vast untapped livestock sector which contributes about 30 percent to the South Sudan's GDP Gross domestic product. The country has 12 million cattle population, 14 million goats and sheep. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) head of programs Felix Dzvurumi said the spread of the disease would worsen the food insecurity situation in the country. The move comes after the UN declared an outbreak in June 2017 of the fall army worm _Spodoptera frugiperda_, a moth whose larvae are mainly a pest of maize, with potential hosts from 26 plant families, putting at risk 6 million people who are already food insecure. \"It is coming at a time when we have other transboundary diseases like fall army worm. All these are putting pressure on the food security of the country,\" Dzvurumi said. Meanwhile, the FAO Livestock Officer Nemaya Moga, confirmed an outbreak of FMD, but disclosed it is the government to make official declaration and that further tests are being conducted in the laboratory. \"Efforts have been done to test in the laboratory. It now depends on the government to declare an outbreak of the disease,\" he said. Moga added it would take about 18 years for the disease to be controlled in the country as there is lack of well-equipped laboratories, research institutes, and few veterinary officers at local levels in the now 34 states. The 4 Eastern African countries Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, and South Sudan launched a joint initiative on controlling transboundary livestock diseases. Foot-and-mouth disease, according to FAO is one of the transboundary diseases which has been recognized as one of the devastating diseases seriously affecting food security and global trade in livestock and livestock products in the world. Duku said that without donor support and capacity building, the FMD will impede their ability to export livestock. \"It will impede our ability to export livestock. If we can't get the budget allocation now then we should go around to donors with a basket,\" he said. \"You cannot control the disease here when it is in neighboring countries. So, what is being done here should also be done there,\" Moga said of the East African countries like Uganda, Kenya and Ethiopia which share the border with South Sudan. In South Sudan, the disease is endemic, this year 2017 alone 7 outbreaks have been documented from different locations indicating that the disease has spread and affected livestock throughout the country. There is, therefore, a desire to control and finally eradicate the disease in South Sudan and also within the global community. South Sudan this year 2017 has witnessed numerous outbreaks of livestock disease next to foot-and-mouth disease including lumpy skin disease, hemorrhagic septicemia and more. These diseases have a devastating effect on livestock keeping communities in the country as it is affecting availability of food. Byline: Zhou Xin  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. At least, 7 fresh FMD outbreaks have recently been registered throughout the country, however, it is stated in the above article that 4 million cattle heads are infected; actually this could only be a rough estimation of cattle population threatened with the disease. It is also said that it will take about 18 years to get rid of this scourge. It is not clear to understand why 18 years! However, as rightly mentioned, joint effort of at least 4 countries comprising Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda, in addition to South Sudan, are highly recommended to combat this transboundary animal disease. A better surveillance and disease information system, backed with competent and sufficient staff and functional diagnostic laboratories would be a pre-requisite before launching a coherent FMD control program in the 34 country regions and in coordination with neighboring countries. - Mod.AB   .

The largest number of cases occurred in Shanxi Province, where 47 new cases were reported. In addition, two provinces reported SARS cases for the first time \u2013 10 in Inner Mongolia and 3 in Fujian.  The reports indicate that the nationwide surveillance system, recently introduced by Chinese authorities, is working to detect and report cases. However, questions remain about the capacity of some provinces to cope with the challenge of SARS.  Last week, the interim report of the WHO investigative team concluded that the health system in Guangdong Province, where the first recognized cases of SARS occurred in mid-November, had responded well to the outbreak. However, the report noted many concerns about the ability of other provinces, that lack Guangdong\u2019s strong health system, to respond promptly and effectively to SARS.  While Beijing authorities appear to have contained transmission in some hospitals, they have not yet granted WHO experts permission to visit military hospitals, which have been the focus of numerous rumours. WHO staff in Beijing have expressed particular concern about the official response to rumours and the apparent absence of rigorous contact tracing.  WHO is currently exploring ways to strengthen its support to China. Shanghai has requested a visit from a WHO team. Teams to meet this request and follow up on other needs in China are now being assembled by WHO and will soon travel to China.  Status of scientific knowledge Canadian scientists working around the clock have completed full sequencing of the genome of the SARS virus. This is a major step forward that will boost the development of better diagnostic tests and underpin work on a vaccine.  The rapid sequencing of the SARS virus genome was facilitated by collaboration with numerous other scientists, also working non-stop, at laboratories in a WHO network set up in mid-March.  A PCR test, developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has been shown to be ten times more sensitive than previous PCR tests for SARS. WHO experts hope that the test will be ready for roll out by the end of this week.  Status of clinical knowledge Data available to WHO indicate that 96% of persons developing SARS recover spontaneously. The focus now is on the roughly 4% who are dying. WHO will hold a clinical teleconference on Wednesday to gather international experiences in the management of SARS patients and pool data on the results of various therapeutic regimens.  Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 3169 cases of SARS, with 144 deaths, have been reported to WHO from 21 countries. This represents an increase of 213 cases and 25 deaths since the last update on Saturday.  Indonesia, the Philippines, and Sweden report their first probable cases (1 in each country) today. Japan, which had previously reported four probable cases, was removed from the list as these cases were determined to have other causes.  China, with 1418 cases and 64 deaths, remains the most seriously affected area. Hong Kong SAR, with 1190 cases and 47 deaths, is the second most seriously affected area. Three of the deaths in Hong Kong over the weekend occurred in persons under the age of 50, marking a departure from a previously pattern in which SARS caused deaths primarily in the elderly or in persons with pre-existing disease.

Since 16 Mar 2017, 10 cases of invasive GAS infection with genotype emm74 have been reported in this population. 3 cases have died. 2 additional invasive GAS cases with the same sociodemographic profile are awaiting genotype results. Cases include 9 males and 1 female, ranging in age from 35 to 72 years (average 54 years, median 52 years). The majority of cases arose in the south-central area of the city Montreal. Information obtained during the investigation indicates that all cases accessed one or several community resources for homeless individuals in the month prior to falling ill, such as shelters or day centres. Clinical presentation of cases consists primarily of soft tissue GAS infections (5/10) and bacteremia without primary infection site identified (3/10). Cases are considered severe because of soft tissue necrosis (2/10), toxic shock (5/10), or death (3/10). In the past 5 years, the GAS genotype emm74 had not been identified in Montreal but was identified in a GAS outbreak in a homeless shelter in Toronto in 2016 (see ProMED-mail post Streptococcus, group A - Canada (02): (ON) fatal, homeless shelter, emm74, clonal http://promedmail.org/post/20170406.4952247). The outbreak investigation has led to the implementation of a surveillance system of non-invasive GAS infections in this population. To date, 18 non-invasive GAS cases were reported. Among 11 cases with genotype results, 5 have the genotype emm74 (45 percent). Genotype is pending for the other cases. Homeless populations are at higher risk for GAS infections due to factors including close proximity in shelter settings, limited access to personal hygiene measures, higher rates of infestations (lice, scabies, and bed bugs), and barriers to accessing medical services. Montreal Public Health is collaborating with services for homeless individuals, clinical teams, and community partners to ensure the improvement of health and hygiene measures, the rapid detection of cases, and the clinical management of symptomatic individuals.

GAS can be highly contagious; skin lesions, poor personal hygiene, and crowding in shelters for the homeless would be expected to facilitate its spread from person to person. Some strains of GAS are more virulent than others. Tissue invasiveness of GAS has been attributed to several virulence factors, especially the cell wall M protein, encoded by the _emm_ gene. Strains have been typed based on the antigenic specificity of its M protein. More recently GAS are typed on the basis of sequence analysis of the portion of the _emm_ gene that encodes M serospecificity ( ). Over 200 _emm_ types have been identified. Other molecular techniques to further characterize outbreak strains include pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of chromosomal DNA fragments, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), detection of exotoxin-encoding genes, and whole genome sequencing ( ,  ,  , and  ). Molecular analysis of the isolates aids documenting a common source for an outbreak. An outbreak of invasive GAS disease due genotype emm74 occurred in Toronto recently (see ProMED-mail Streptococcus, group A - Canada (02): (ON) fatal, homeless shelter, emm74, clonal http://promedmail.org/post/20170406.4952247). This _emm_ type was detected initially in December 2015 and in temporal association with this outbreak, there has been a substantial increase in invasive GAS infection due to emm74 in the local community. Genotyping by whole genome sequencing established that the Toronto emm74 outbreak strains were highly clonal (ProMED-mail Streptococcus, group A - Canada (02): (ON) fatal, homeless shelter, emm74, clonal http://promedmail.org/post/20170406.4952247). It would be important to learn if genotyping by whole genome sequencing has been done on the Quebec outbreak strains to see if they match each other and also if they match the Toronto strains. - Mod.ML   .

As a precautionary measure, as many as 100 blood samples of horses have been taken so far and sent for testing. The infectious disease is caused by a bacterium which spreads from animal to animal. Humans who come in contact with the affected animals can also contract this disease. There are 6000 horses and other equines in the district. The detection of the disease has spread panic among owners. Giving details, deputy chief veterinary officer Yogendra Panwar said, \"In 2011, some 5 horses were diagnosed with this disease in Chandpur area of Bijnor district. They were put to sleep to save other equines. Since then, our department has been running a drive in this regard to make horse owners aware about this disease. We have been taking blood samples of horses repeatedly in the district. Last month July 2017, 2 horses were diagnosed with Glanders in Najibabad area. Both horses had to be killed by a team of veterinary doctors...\" The veterinary officer explained since there is no known treatment or vaccine for Glanders, an animal that tests positive is put to sleep to prevent the disease from spreading. It is a fatal disease. Government compensates the equine owner after killing a sick animal. The compensation for horses and mules range from Rs 16 000 to Rs 25 000 USD 250.00 to 390.00 he added. byline: Harveer Dabas  communicated by: ProMED-mail India and Brazil are known to lead the list of countries where glanders, a zoonotic, OIE-listed equids disease, is endemic. Media reports on cases of the traditionally fearsome glanders, are often published by the Indian press. This is not fully reflected in India's official reports to the OIE. According to the recent ones, the annual numbers of recorded glanders outbreaks (in equidae) countrywide were as follows: 2010 - 1; 2011 - 3; 2012 - 1; 2013 - 1; 2014 - 0; 2015 - 5. During the 1st semester of 2016, 9 outbreaks were reported, involving 45 cases of which 36 died. India's OIE semi-annual report for the period Jul-Dec 2016 is not yet available. No statistics on the incidence of glanders in humans in India could be obtained. Glanders is a contagious and fatal disease of horses, donkeys, and mules, caused by infection with the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_. The pathogen causes nodules and ulcerations in the upper respiratory tract and lungs. A skin form also occurs, known as 'farcy'. Control of glanders requires testing of suspect clinical cases, screening of apparently normal equids, and elimination of reactors. _B. mallei_ can be transmitted to humans, but such cases, which were known to be often fatal, have become rather uncommon (see ref 1). In view of its zoonotic potential, all infected or contaminated (or potentially infected or contaminated) material must be handled in a laboratory with appropriate biosafety and biosecurity controls following a biorisk analysis.

Anthracnose black spots have developed thanks in part to a rainy season. Part of the problem is that the anthracnose isn't being detected until it's too late. \"In Florida USA, we pick mango with great ripeness,\" says a Florida mango grower. \"But in Mexico, they have to pick it almost green and they don't see the anthracnose until it gets ripe. So when they come through everything looks fine, but at the stores, there have been a lot of complaints.\" Byline: Astrid van den Broek  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail Anthracnose is considered the most important disease of mango. It is caused by the fungi _Colletotrichum gloeosporioides_ (synonym _Glomerella cingulata_) or _C. acutatum_. Symptoms may include flower blight, pre- and post-harvest fruit rot, twig dieback, and leaf spots. Anthracnose can completely destroy the flowers and cause extensive dead areas on leaves, greatly reducing yield. The fungi apparently invade the skin of young fruit and remain in a latent state until fruit ripening begins. Ripe fruit, either before or after picking, can then develop prominent dark-brown to black spots. Fruit infection commonly occurs and can result in extensive rotting. The fungi have a long saprophytic survival ability on dead twigs and fallen leaves. These are the main sources of inoculum and spread may occur with infected plant material, by mechanical means (including insect activities) and water splash. The disease is favoured by humid conditions during the period from the onset of flowering until fruit are about half size. Control of anthracnose in mango usually centers on a diligent fungicide programme, but may also include phytosanitation to reduce inoculum, as well as cultural measures to reduce moisture in the orchard. More Indo-Chinese/Philippine type mango varieties show levels of resistance to anthracnose than Indian type varieties.

Zika virus (or Zika) has been reported in Sint Maarten. Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in Sint Maarten are infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:  Women who are pregnant:  Do not travel to Sint Maarten.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to Sint Maarten or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers considering pregnancy:  Before you or your partner travel, talk to your health care provider about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection.  Wait before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.  If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex &ndash; or do not have sex &ndash; for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex, or do not have sex, for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy  Talk to your health care provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you&rsquo;re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Wait at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  Men are advised to wait longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.gov  Contact CDC  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  1600 Clifton Road  Atlanta ,  GA  30329-4027  USA  800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)  Contact CDC-INFO  TOP", "dates": [" Page created: February 29 2016", " Page last updated: August 08 2017", " Page last reviewed: August 08 2017", " 30329-4027", " 800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)"], "title": ["Zika Virus in Sint Maarten"]}, "422": {"sentences": " 3 Government statement denying outbreak  11 Aug 2017 Source: Premium Times edited The Kwara State Government on Friday denied a report that an outbreak of a mystery illness had claimed 70 lives in Oro-Ago in Ifelodun Local Government Area of the state. Suleiman Alege, the State's Commissioner for Health, said the report is a mere rumour as the ministry has no confirmed outbreak of disease or fatalities in any part of the state. Mr. Alege said there are epidemiological systems for reporting suspected disease outbreaks in the state and that if any occurs, the State Health Response team would be the first to know and is always ready to swing into action. The commissioner recalled that when there were reported cases of Cholera in some communities in the state, the state government immediately deployed emergency kits to the affected areas and also commenced vaccination in most of the state primary healthcare centers to forestall outbreak of an epidemic. There had been unverified reports of outbreak of disease in the community on Thursday 10 Aug 2017. But the commissioner noted that immediately the rumour of the strange disease broke on Thursday, the state Ministry of Health deployed a team from the endemic unit under the department of public health to Gaa Okuta community along Oke-ode road in Ifelodun Local Government area. The team, however, found no evidence of any strange illness or casualties, he said. He disclosed that members of the community also insisted that there was no disease outbreak in the area. He added that the community's water source was also tested to ascertain if there was any form of contamination. Similarly, the Ifelodun council Chairman, Mukaila Ayinla, on Friday 11 Aug 2017 said the reports of the alleged disease outbreak in the community are false and should be disregarded. A statement by Muideen Akorede, senior special assistant to the State Governor on Media and Communication, quoted Mr. Ayinla as saying the council was working on posting a new medical team to the primary health care facility in the area, following the transfer of the staff at the facility. A similar response was also received from an Epicore Surveillance Project member denying any outbreak was occurring. - Mod.JH Byline: Oladeinde Olawoyin  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\.org ProMED-mail also thanks Irene Lai ( ), affiliation: International SOS, for submission of this report in response to the RFI.

None of them was diagnosed as Dobrava with PCR for Dobrava serotype virus. Both cases were IgM and IgG positive for hantaviruses with ELISA. The case coming from Macedonia was doing seasonal work in a Macedonian village. Spas are near Debar in Macedonia and very near to the Albanian border and the patient had no contacts with the cases recently diagnosed in Macedonia and also had not been in the Gostivar Macedonia area. The case coming from Greece has to be verified because he is coming from an area known for HFRS in Albania and the incubation period cannot exactly fall within his time in Greece, in the Veria area near Thessaloniki. During a study conducted by Rogozi and myself, published in J Med Virol. 2016; 88(8): 1309-13; doi:10.1002/jmv.24486. Epub 2016 Feb 8   on genetic detection of hantaviruses in rodents in Albania, Dobrava-Belgrade virus (DOBV) was detected in 10 of 148 (6.7 percent) _Apodemus flavicollis_ rodents. DOBV-positive _A. flavicollis_ were detected in 6 districts (Diber, Korce, Kolonje, Librazhd, Pogradec, and Vlore). Among those districts was that of Diber, very near the Macedonian border, and the place where the recent patient might have been infected. Also among them is the district for the 2nd patient that we cannot verify and cannot say is imported from Greece.  Dr Silvia Bino Head of Control of Infectious Diseases Department Institute of Public Health Tirana Albania Dr Silvia Bino is thanked for sending in this report and for the reference providing evidence of Dobrava-Belgrade virus in rodents in several districts in Albania. The virus is doubtless endemic there, and poses a public health risk for individuals in contact with these rodents and their habitats. As noted in the previous post, these are the 1st reports of hantavirus infections in Macedonia that ProMED-mail has posted. There is also evidence of HFRS in Greece, although ProMED-mail has not posted reports previously. Seroepidemiological investigations conducted in several Balkan countries revealed an overall seroprevalence of 4 percent in Greece ( ). There doubtless have been Dobrava-Belgrade virus infections in Greece and the Balkans over the years, given that this virus is known to circulate widely in the Balkans. The yellow-necked field mouse (_Apodemus flavicollis_) is the principle vertebrate host for Dobrava-Belgrade virus. - Mod.TY   .

The USD 5 million will be used to convert current Level 3 containment laboratory space to the \"highest level of biosafety,\" the federal government said in a news release on Thu 20 Jul 2017. The facility already holds a Containment Level 4 lab, which will be expanded by the investment. Health Minister Jane Philpott made the announcement at the Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health, which houses the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg. The increased space will help staff at the lab better respond to Ebola virus disease (EVD), Middle East respiratory syndrome, and new types of avian influenza quicker amid the increased global demand for investigation of cases. Containment Level 4 laboratories are equipped to diagnose, research and develop vaccines for Ebola and Nipah virus. In November 2016, a Winnipeg employee at the level 4 lab was potentially exposed to the Ebola virus. The worker noticed a split in his protective suit while working with pigs that had been exposed to the Ebola virus. The worker was put in isolation for 21 days and was eventually cleared to return to work. The government said emergency protocols for accidental exposure were implemented following the incident.

Vaccines protect fetus from Zika. JAMA. 2017; 318(8): 689. doi:10.1001/jama.2017.<br><br><strong>11200 </strong><br> Researchers funded in part by the National Institutes of Health have recently demonstrated that 2 experimental vaccines can restrict transmission of Zika virus from pregnant mice to their fetuses, thereby shielding offspring from congenital damage or death. Multiple candidate Zika vaccines have been shown protective against infection with the virus in animal studies, with several now in human trials, but none were tested in the context of pregnancy, according to the authors of the study published in Cell  . The 2 vaccine candidates investigated in the new study are the 1st to demonstrate efficacy in preventing vertical transmission of the virus and related fetal death in an animal model. Although the vaccines were administered to female mice prior to pregnancy, the result is considered an important step toward developing a vaccine that could be safely given to pregnant women. One of the 2 candidates is a modified messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine encoding Zika genes, developed by the biotechnology company Moderna. It is already in safety trials in women who are not pregnant. The other is a live-attenuated Zika strain developed by researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). The testing was carried out by scientists from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Washington University School of Medicine, and UTMB. The researchers 1st vaccinated the mice with 1 of the vaccines or a placebo. After mating, the animals were challenged with the virus 6 days into pregnancy. A week later, more than 50 percent of placentas and fetuses from mice administered the mRNA vaccine had virtually no Zika RNA. The remainder had \"substantially lower\" levels relative to placebo. The live vaccine provided broader protection: 78 percent of placentas and 83 percent of fetuses had Zika RNA at or below the level of detection, while the placebo group exhibited significantly higher levels of placental and fetal Zika RNA. Mice vaccinated with either vaccine had significantly higher rates of fetal viability; whereas 100 percent of fetuses from mice vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine were born, none survived to term in the placebo group. A working group funded by the Wellcome Trust recently approved ethical guidelines for testing such vaccines in pregnant women, normally excluded from drug trials.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. It is reassuring to learn that at least 2 vaccines are now entering clinical trials in women. Although anti-Zika virus drugs are under development, preventing infection through vaccination seems to be the most effective measure to prevent fetal infection and adverse effects of the virus infection in adults. - Mod.TY ", "dates": ["As of 24 Aug 2017", "Bermuda / 0 / 0 / 6 / 0 / 0", "Canada / 0 / 0 / 507 / 0 / 1", "USA / 0 / 224 / 5150 / 0 / 93", "Mexico / 0 / 9378 / 15 / 0 / 15", "Belize / 1832 / 290 / 0 / 0 / 0", "Costa Rica / 7100 / 1887 / 32 / 0 / 6", "El Salvador / 11 628 / 51 / 0 / 0 / 4", "Guatemala / 3741 / 983 / 0 / 0 / 140", "Honduras / 32 130 / 302 / 0 / 0 / 4", "Nicaragua / 0 / 2060 / 3 / 0 / 2", "Panama / 4802 / 1035 / 42 / 0 / 13", "Cuba / 0 / 187 / 58 / 0 / 0", "Dominican Republic / 4913 / 345 / 0 / 0 / 93", "French Guiana / 10 500 / 483 / 10 / 0 / 1", "Guadeloupe / 30 845 / 382 / 0 / 0 / 5", "Haiti / 2955 / 5 / 0 / 0 / 1", "Martinique / 36 680 / 21 / 0 / 0 / 5", "Puerto Rico / 0 / 40 569 / 137 / 5 / 47", "Saint Barthelemy / 1005 / 61 / 0 / 0 / 0", "Saint Martin / 3283 / 200 / 0 / 0 / 1", "Anguilla / 31 / 23 / 1 / 0 / 0", "Antigua and Barbuda / 540 / 25 / 2 / 0 / 0", "Aruba / 1208 / 703 / 7 / 0 / 0", "Bahamas / 531 / 25 / 3 / 0 / 0", "Barbados / 715 / 150 / 0 / 0 / 1", "Bonaire St Eustatius and Saba / 235 / 437 / 0 / 0 / 0", "Caymans / 237 / 30 / 11 / 0 / 0", "Curacao / 4476 / 2049 / 0 / 0 / 0", "Dominica / 1154 / 79 / 0 / 0 / 0", "Grenada / 335 / 118 / 0 / 0 / 2", "Guyana / 0 / 37 / 0 / 0 / 0", "Jamaica / 7650 / 203 / 0 / 0 / 0", "Montserrat / 18 / 5 / 0 / 0 / 0", "Saint Kits and Nevis / 554 / 33 / 0 / 0 / 0", "Saint Lucia / 822 / 50 / 0 / 0 / 0", "Saint Vincent and the Grenadines / 508 / 83 / 0 / 0 / 0", "Sint Maarten / 253 / 149 / 0 / 0 / 0", "Suriname / 2768 / 724 / 0 / 4 / 4", "Trinidad and Tobago / 0 / 718 / 1 / 0 / 17", "Turks and Caicos / 203 / 25 / 3 / 0 / 0", "Virgin Islands (UK) / 74 / 53 / 0 / 0 / 0", "Virgin Islands (USA) / 1158 / 1024 / 2 / 0 / 0", "Bolivia / 2525 / 785 / 4 / 0 / 14", "Colombia / 98 515 / 9802 / 0 / 0 / 187", "Ecuador / 3753 / 3058 / 15 / 0 / 7", "Peru / 6391 / 1502 / 22 / 0 / 0", "Venezuela / 59 965 / 2413 / 0 / 0 / 0", "Brazil / 220 717 / 136 846 / 0 / 11 / 2869", "Argentina / 869 / 138 / 40 / 0 / 2", "Chile / 0 / 0 / 34 / 0 / 0", "Paraguay / 662 / 16 / 0 / 0 / 2", "Uruguay / 0 / 0 / 1 / 0 / 0", "Totals Americas / 568 181 / 219 766 / 6106 / 20 / 3539", " 24 Aug 2017", " 21 Aug 2017", " 17 Aug 2017 (registered) 145 cases of", "Jan 2017-23 Aug 2017", "Date: 14 Aug 2017", " 2017; 146: 1-11", "Date: Mon 21 Aug 2017", "1038/s41564-017-0016-3", "Date: Tue 22 Aug 2017", " bioRxiv 179416; doi:10", "1101/179416", "S1473-3099(17)30444-9", "1016/S1473-3099(17)30444-9", "collected at days 7 11 20 30 60 90 and 120 after symptom onset", " At days 7 11 and 20 semen was", "15 male volunteers (mean age 35 years [SD 5; range 25-44) with acute", "119\u00e2\u0080\u0088\u00c3--\u00e2\u0080\u008810^6 spermatozoa (IQR [interquartile range] 22-234)", "2\u00e2\u0080\u0088\u00c3--\u00e2\u0080\u008810^6 (16", "6) at day 30 and 70", "\u00c3-- 10^6 (28", "5 pg/mL (IQR 55-162) at", "day 7 to 150 pg/mL (78-209) at day 120 when total sperm count", "separation Zika virus RNA was found in 3 of 14 patients at day 7 4", "of 15 at day 11 and 4 of 15 at day 20 and replication-competent", "frequently positive for Zika virus RNA (62 of 92 samples) and 3", "Date: 22/29 Aug 2017", " 2017; 318(8):", "11200"], "title": "Zika virus (17): Americas, research, observations "}, "377": {"sentences": "   Fri 4 Aug 2017 9:18 AM CDT Source: The Charlotte Observer, Associated Press (AP) report edited Authorities say all the people with confirmed diagnoses of salmonellosis ate at the same cafe in north east Nebraska.

Updated recommendations and resources on HAV are provided.<br><br><strong> Situation -</strong><br> As of 14 Aug 2017, 333 confirmed or probable HAV cases have been reported in an ongoing local outbreak in San Diego County. The cases had symptom onsets between 22 Nov 2016 and 8 Aug 2017. 232 (70 percent) of the cases have been hospitalized, and 11 patients (3 percent) have died. The cases range in age from 19 to 87 years (median = 44 years), and 227 (68 percent) are male, with 2 (1 percent) self-identifying as men who have sex with men (MSM). 131 (39 percent) of the HAV cases are homeless and reported injection or non-injection illicit drug use, 53 (16 percent) were homeless only, 36 (11 percent) were illicit drug users only, 76 (23 percent) were neither homeless nor drug users, and 37 (11 percent) had an unknown status for homelessness and drug use. Of the cases with test results available for review, 58 of 262 (22 percent) have chronic hepatitis C infection, and 15 of 261 (6 percent) have chronic hepatitis B infection. Despite the fact that the majority of the cases in this outbreak had a known indication for HAV immunization, only one case had been vaccinated prior to becoming infected: a 20-year-old who had routine HAV immunizations as a child. Most of the outbreak cases have been from the El Cajon/La Mesa area and downtown San Diego. Some cases have been confirmed in individuals who were only in the southern or northern parts of the county during their exposure periods. There are several clusters of epidemiologically associated cases, although no specific common food, beverage, or drug sources have been identified. Case clusters have been reported in individuals who have used the same homeless services providers and in the following types of facilities with shared restrooms: jails, single room occupancy hotels, residential drug treatment facilities, and assisted living facilities. 3 healthcare workers contracted HAV infection in this outbreak, as have four food handlers, although no secondary cases have resulted from the individuals working in these sensitive occupations. The CDC has confirmed HAV RNA in serum samples of 199 outbreak cases. Viral sequencing indicates that 8 unique, closely related strains of HAV genotype 1B are involved. These strains are different than those associated with an ongoing HAV outbreak in southeastern Michigan and the outbreaks linked to frozen strawberries in 2016 and pomegranate arils (seed pods) in 2013. The main outbreak strain in San Diego is identical to one of the strains causing an ongoing HAV outbreak in Santa Cruz County. Investigations of the confirmed and probable cases, as well as 37 suspect cases, are ongoing. 19 HAV cases have been reported in 2017 that are travel-related and are not part of the local outbreak totals. Of note, 1 case was diagnosed with symptomatic HAV infection 4 weeks after a trip to Paris, and viral sequence analysis indicated that the HAV strain causing his infection is identical to the one causing an outbreak among MSM in France.<br><br><strong> Background </strong><br> Person-to-person transmission through the fecal-oral route is the primary means of HAV transmission in the USA. Most infections result from close personal contact with an infected household member or sexual partner, or their fecally contaminated environment. Hands may play a significant role in the direct and indirect spread of HAV. Commonsource outbreaks and sporadic cases can also occur from exposure to fecally contaminated food or water. Individuals with increased risk for HAV infection include: travelers to countries with high or intermediate endemicity of HAV, MSM, users of injection and non-injection illicit drugs, persons with clotting factor disorders, and persons working with nonhuman primates. HAV outbreaks have been reported among the homeless, who have a higher morbidity and mortality when compared with the general population and an increased risk of infection due to living conditions. Individuals with chronic liver conditions, such as hepatitis B or C, are also recommended to get HAV vaccination because of their increased morbidity and mortality risks should they contract HAV.<br><br><strong> Recommendations for providers -</strong><br> 1. Consider HAV infection in individuals, especially the homeless and those who use illicit drugs, with discrete symptom onset and jaundice or elevated liver function tests. - Symptoms of concern include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, fever, malaise, dark urine, light-colored stool, and abdominal pain. - A complete serology panel with testing for hepatitis A, B, and C is recommended in symptomatic patients. HIV testing is also recommended for those with an undocumented HIV-status. - Serologic testing for HAV infection is not recommended in asymptomatic individuals or as screening before vaccination. 2. Promptly report all confirmed and suspect HAV cases to the Epidemiology Program. - Please fax Confidential Morbidity Report (CMRa)  , or call 619-692-8499 (Monday-Friday, 8 AM-5 PM), or 858565-5255 (after hours, during weekends, and on county-observed holidays). - Since this outbreak involves homeless individuals, providers are urged to contact the Epidemiology Program while suspected cases are still at the healthcare facility. This action will ensure that a public health investigator can interview the patient by phone for a risk history and will facilitate serum specimen submission to the San Diego County Public Health Laboratory for possible genotyping. 3. Provide post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for close contacts of confirmed HAV cases. - Susceptible people exposed to HAV should receive a dose of single-antigen HAV vaccine intramuscular (IM) immune globulin (IG) (0.1 mL/kg), or both, as soon as possible within 2 weeks of last exposure. The PEP dosage of IG was recently increased and is higher than that noted in the package insert. - The efficacy of combined HAV/Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine (Twinrix\u00ae) for PEP has not been evaluated, so it is not recommended for PEP. - Detailed information on PEP may be found on the CDPH California Department of Public Health Hepatitis A PEP Guidance Quicksheet (updated July 2017)   and the CDPH Hepatitis A PEP IG Administration Quicksheet (updated August 2017)  . 4. Provide HAV vaccine to homeless individuals, illicit drug users, patients with chronic liver diseases, MSM, and other at-risk people who are not already immunized, and to any individual who desires immunity to HAV. - The 1st dose of single-antigen HAV vaccine (Havrix\u00ae, Vaqta\u00ae) appears to protect more persons than the 1st dose of the combined HAV/HBV (Twinrix\u00ae) vaccine, but efficacy is comparable after completion of the respective series. Providers should consider short-term risks of exposure to HAV, the likelihood of follow-up to complete immunization, and the need for protection from HBV when selecting vaccines for those at risk. Immunization against HAV with existing supplies should not be delayed to obtain a different formulation of vaccine. - Providers who do not have available vaccine may direct patients to an immunization clinic at the nearest County Public Health Center. -Providers who care for homeless individuals may contact the Immunization Program at 619-692-5607 (Monday-Friday, 8 AM-5 PM) to learn how to obtain 317-funded HAV vaccine for use during this outbreak. - Homeless individuals and illicit drug users are also at higher risk for other vaccine preventable diseases and should be brought up-to-date with recommended vaccines per the relevant CDC immunization schedule. - Providers should check the San Diego Immunization Registry to see if patients are already vaccinated and note any vaccinations given. - Some individuals who are at risk for HAV may be uncomfortable disclosing the reasons that they are at risk to a provider, so the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices routinely recommends HAV vaccination \"for any person wishing to obtain immunity.\" - Adult HAV vaccination is covered by Medi-Cal without prior authorization. 5. Provide HAV vaccination to individuals who have frequent, ongoing close contact with homeless individuals and illicit drug users, and to all food handlers in San Diego County. - The County Public Health Officer recommends HAV vaccination for individuals with ongoing, close contact with homeless and illicit drug using individuals in San Diego County. This local recommendation is being made due to the current outbreak and includes persons working in health care, public safety, sanitation, homeless shelters, and homeless and behavioral service provider agencies. - The County Public Health Officer recommends HAV vaccination for all food handlers in San Diego County. This local recommendation is being made to reduce the potential risk of an ill food handler transmitting HAV to others. 6. Encourage those who are planning an international trip to check the CDC Travelers' Health website and to obtain recommended vaccinations before travel. - High-risk areas for HAV include parts of Africa and Asia, and moderate-risk areas include Central and South America, Eastern Europe, and parts of Asia. - There are currently HAV outbreaks associated with MSM occurring in New York City and in Western Europe, notably France, Portugal, and Spain. MSM should be vaccinated against HAV, especially prior to travel, and be instructed on prevention measures for HAV and other sexually transmitted illnesses. 7. Ensure that all healthcare workers use standard precautions in patient care to protect themselves against HAV. HAV, like norovirus, is a non-enveloped virus, and it may be similarly difficult to inactivate in the environment. Alcohol-based hand rubs and typically-used surface disinfectants may not be effective. Therefore, additional precautions to take include: - Wash hands with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds after providing care for an HAV patient. - Use contact precautions, in addition to standard precautions, in the care of diapered or incontinent HAV patients. - Wash hands with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds before eating and after using a restroom. - Use employee-designated restrooms when available, and do not touch the door handle directly when exiting a restroom. - Do not eat in patient care areas and never share food, drink or cigarettes with patients. - Do not handle a cell phone just before (or while) eating. Studies have shown that cell phones have high rates of surface contamination with enteric organisms (and for hospital employees, organisms associated with hospital acquired infections). - Perform environmental cleaning in areas housing HAV patients with bleach products or other products effective against norovirus. - HAV vaccine is recommended for unvaccinated healthcare workers caring for HAV patients or individuals at risk for HAV. The vaccine should be available and encouraged for other unvaccinated healthcare personnel concerned about increased exposure to HAV.  <br><br>Communicated by: Eric McDonald County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency California USA ProMED thanks Eric McDonald for this posting.

A very short incubation of a vomiting-associated illness (less than 1 hour) suggests that the etiology was heavy metal ingestion. A number of metals can cause this type of syndrome, which is usually caused by the ingestion of a liquid that had been kept in a metallic container. These metals include antimony, copper, tin, and zinc. The illnesses are usually self-limiting and require only symptomatic care. In addition to vomiting, other clues may include the liquid being described as having a metallic taste. Identifying the specific cause requires analysis of the food or liquid vehicle.

The case-patient was a 35-year-old male, who developed symptoms on 23 Jun 2017, and died on 30 Jun 2017. This was the 1st reported case from Xinjiang since April 2015. He was a butcher and seller at a live poultry market. On 14 Jul 2017, the NHFPC reported one laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in China. The case-patient was a 54-year-old male from Yunnan province. He developed symptoms on 23 Jun 2017 and was admitted to hospital with severe pneumonia on 28 Jun 2017. He was reported to have had exposure to a live poultry market. On 21 Jul 2017, the NHFPC reported one laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in China. The case-patient was a 62-year-old female from Jiangsu province. She developed symptoms on 12 Jul 2017 and was admitted to hospital with severe pneumonia on 13 Jul 2017. She was reported to have had exposure to a live poultry market. The Chinese government has assessed that it is still likely that sporadic cases will occur in China, taking into consideration the previous epidemic situation and risk assessment. To date, a total of 1557 laboratory-confirmed human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported in China through IHR notification since early 2013.<br><br><strong> Public health response </strong><br> The Chinese government at national and local levels continues to take preventive measures, which include: - Continuing to guide the provinces to strengthen assessment, and prevention and control measures. - Continuing to strengthen control measures focusing on hygienic management of live poultry markets and cross-regional transportation. - Conducting detailed source investigations to inform effective prevention and control measures. - Continuing to detect and treat human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) early to reduce mortality. - Continuing to carry out risk communication and issue information notices to provide the public with guidance on self-protection. - Strengthening virology surveillance to better understand levels of virus contamination in the environment as well as mutations in order to provide further guidance for prevention and control.<br><br><strong> WHO risk assessment -</strong><br> As seen in previous years, the number of weekly reported cases of infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus has decreased over the summer months. However, the number of human infections and the geographical distribution in the 5th epidemic wave (i.e. onset since 1 Oct 2016) has been greater than earlier waves. This suggests that the virus has spread and emphasizes that further intensive surveillance and control measures in both the human and animal health sectors remain crucial. Most human case-patients have been exposed to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, and live poultry vending continues, further human cases can be expected. Additional sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) are also expected in provinces in China that have not yet reported human cases. Similarly, sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) detected in countries bordering China would not be unexpected. Although small clusters of cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported, including those involving patients in the same ward, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the capacity for sustained transmission among humans. Therefore, the likelihood of further community level spread is considered low. Close analysis of the epidemiological situation and further characterization of the most recent viruses are critical to assess associated risk and to adjust risk management measures in a timely manner.<br><br><strong> WHO advice -</strong><br> WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should, if possible, avoid poultry farms, contact with animals in live poultry markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water and follow good food safety and food hygiene practices. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions with regard to this event. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling in, or soon after returning from, an area where avian influenza is a concern. WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI), and to carefully review any unusual patterns; ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR 2005; and continue national health preparedness actions.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\.

According to a 5 Jul 2017 report by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, CDPHE the state had already seen 43 confirmed cases thus far in 2017  a sharp increase from baseline rates that has now grown to 49 cases statewide. \"There is an outbreak going on in the state of Colorado,\" said Kathy Nelson, Pueblo City-County Health Department program manager. \"So far this year in 2017, we've had 7 confirmed cases of hepatitis A in Pueblo and normally we don't have that amount.\" The 7 cases currently confirmed in Pueblo County marks the 3rd highest number of any county in the state trailing only El Paso County with 10 and Adams County with 9. The number marks a drastic increase in Pueblo County; the health department recorded only 1 case in 2013 and 2 cases in 2016, with no reported cases in either 2014 or 2015. Hepatitis A is contracted when a person consumes infected fecal matter, often by ingesting food or drinks contaminated with stool from an infected person. When the hands of a person infected with hepatitis A are not properly washed after using the restroom, the disease can be transmitted to surfaces, food or drink, therefore, the consumption of food or drink that has come into contact with infected persons is a common way the disease is contracted. Sexual contact is also a common source of infection, particularly among men who have sex with men. The CDPHE report detailed that at least 15 of the 43 cases reported as of 5 Jul 2017 were in the men who have sex with men MSM group  a group for whom routine hepatitis A vaccinations are recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. \"There's certain groups that are more likely to get hepatitis A or are at a higher risk, and that is usually the men who have sex with men,\" Nelson said. \"They are a higher risk group, but anybody can be susceptible because it can also be a food-borne disease so anybody could be at risk.\" Other groups considered to be high-risk are people who have sexual contact with an infected person, people who use intravenous drugs and people with chronic liver disease.

Dr Carlos Mu\u00f1oz, Regional Coordinator of Epidemiology for Los Santos confirmed this information for TVN Noticias. One case was notified in the Los Santos district, and the most recent one a 7-year-old child from the Bebederos neighborhood of Tonosi, who remains hospitalized and under observation in the Las Tablas Hospital. This brings to 7 the total cases of hantavirus fever and to 2 the cases of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome in the province. An inspection where the child resides was carried out. The authorities have issued a call to maintain control of crops and to do correct disposition of trash and garbage. Apparently, this recent case has hantavirus fever without hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). HPS is a serious disease and can develop quickly, with a case fatality rate of around 30 percent. This report does not give any details about the circumstances that led to the infection nor specify the hantavirus involved in this case. As noted in comments on previous cases, Los Santos and adjoining provinces are endemic for Choclo hantavirus. Although no data on this or the previous cases in earlier years include an indication of which hantavirus is responsible, Choclo is the only one of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes HPS or hantavirus fever.

En Sud\u00e1n del Sur las enfermedades infecciosas suponen un importante reto para la salud p\u00fablica y son una causa importante de morbilidad, discapacidad y mortalidad en un pa\u00eds que adem\u00e1s est\u00e1 atrapado en un conflicto. La debilidad del sistema de salud p\u00fablica del pa\u00eds agrava la situaci\u00f3n y dificulta una respuesta eficaz a brotes que son en gran parte prevenibles. En el origen de los frecuentes brotes hay varios factores, entre los que destacan el conflicto y los consiguientes desplazamientos de poblaci\u00f3n, el hacinamiento y las malas condiciones del entorno.  La OMS calcula que en Sud\u00e1n del Sur hay 12,3 millones de personas en riesgo de sufrir brotes. En 2015 y 2016, la OMS ayud\u00f3 a identificar, investigar y responder a 49 brotes en diferentes lugares y por diferentes causas, entre ellas el c\u00f3lera, el sarampi\u00f3n, las fiebres hemorr\u00e1gicas v\u00edricas, el paludismo y la hepatitis E.  Con cerca de 3 millones de casos notificados desde 2015, el paludismo es una de las principales causas de morbilidad y mortalidad en Sud\u00e1n del Sur. El c\u00f3lera es otra importante amenaza para la salud p\u00fablica, con m\u00e1s de 4500 casos notificados desde 2015. Tambi\u00e9n son importantes el sarampi\u00f3n y el kala azar.  La lucha contra los brotes  Desde 2006, la OMS ha estado trabajando en Sud\u00e1n del Sur para ayudar a establecer un sistema integrado de vigilancia y respuesta a enfermedades (SIVRE), gracias a la financiaci\u00f3n proporcionada por la Agencia de los Estados Unidos para el Desarrollo Internacional.  En 2013, la OMS ayud\u00f3 a introducir en los estados de Sud\u00e1n del Sur afectados por el conflicto la Red de alerta y respuesta temprana (EWARN) como complemento del SIVRE.  La detecci\u00f3n precoz de las enfermedades ayuda a la OMS, al Ministerio de Salud de Sud\u00e1n del Sur y a los asociados del Grupo de Acci\u00f3n Sanitaria a responder con mayor eficacia. Por ejemplo, la detecci\u00f3n precoz de cerca de 3000 casos de c\u00f3lera notificados este a\u00f1o ha ayudado a la OMS y a los asociados a dirigir la vacunaci\u00f3n, de la que se han beneficiado 69 000 personas.  Para reforzar la capacidad de vigilancia y respuesta a las enfermedades en Sud\u00e1n del Sur, la OMS ha capacitado en 2015 y 2016 a m\u00e1s de 1300 trabajadores de la salud para que lleven a cabo actividades relacionadas con el SIVRE:  231 han sido capacitados en vigilancia y respuesta integradas;  732 en notificaci\u00f3n, preparaci\u00f3n y tratamiento de enfermedades infecciosas;  253 equipos de respuesta r\u00e1pida en investigaci\u00f3n de brotes y respuesta a ellos;  34 en obtenci\u00f3n, procesamiento, envasado y env\u00edo de muestras de pacientes con sospecha de c\u00f3lera y pruebas de diagn\u00f3stico r\u00e1pido de esta enfermedad.  \u00abAgradecemos el compromiso de los donantes y otros asociados con este importante empe\u00f1o\u00bb dice el Dr. Usman de la OMS.  Empiezan a verse resultados, pese a los grandes obst\u00e1culos operacionales  La OMS ha ayudado a reforzar la capacidad del laboratorio nacional de salud p\u00fablica para confirmar el c\u00f3lera, el sarampi\u00f3n, la meningitis e infecciones por bacterias que, como la salmonella y la shigella , pueden causar gastroenteritis grave.  Seg\u00fan la OMS, hay una mejora de la notificaci\u00f3n y de la calidad de los datos tanto de los condados como de los centros sanitarios. Por ejemplo, la completitud de la notificaci\u00f3n por el SIVRE aument\u00f3 entre 2014 y 2016 del 42% al 50%, y su puntualidad del 27% al 51%.  Gracias a la mejora de la capacidad de tratamiento, la OMS se\u00f1ala que la tasa de letalidad del c\u00f3lera ha disminuido del 2,6% en 2014 al 1,5% en 2016.

Although this species can go into diapause to survive the winter, it seems unlikely that significant populations of the mosquito will develop in Michigan. - Mod.TY   .

African swine fever is a highly contagious haemorrhagic disease with a high mortality rate in pigs. Minister of Livestock and Fisheries Michael Katambo said in an interview that Government has since sent a team of experts from the veterinary department to determine the type of virus. Mr Katambo said the experts will also have to do a thorough head count of how many pigs have been killed by the disease before devising measures on how to reduce its impact on the poor farmers. He said the disease could have broken out because of the uncontrolled movement of livestock from one area to another. Mr Katambo said the disease has no vaccine and that the only solution is to burn the carcasses and also to put in place stringent measures to control the movement of livestock in the province. \"Yes, I can confirm that we have an outbreak of African swine fever in Muchinga province. Unfortunately, we have no vaccine for the virus,\" he said. Mr Katambo said Government will have to see how the farmers that have lost their pigs can be compensated, working in partnership with co-operating partners that are promoting livestock farming in the area. And livestock farmers in Chinsali and Isoka districts have expressed sadness over the outbreak of the ASFV in the district and have appealed to Government to help them restock their animals. Adam Mulenga livestock cooperative chairperson Lameck Simwinga said in an interview yesterday 21 Jul 2017 that about 1580 pigs have been wiped out in Chinsali and Nakonde by the virus. Byline: Nkombo Kachemba  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. As apparent from Zambia's OIE immediate notification of 26 Apr 2017 and from Mod.CRD's accompanying commentary, ASF has been recorded, since 2016, from certain zone(s)/region(s) in the Eastern and Northern provinces. From the current media report it appears that the virus is now circulating also in the province located between the Northern and Eastern provinces, namely Muchinga province. The following comment, received in early May 2017 from an EpiCore Global Surveillance Project member (http://promedmail.org/post/20170502.5008477), is applicable also for the current spread of the virus noted in Zambia: \"Depopulation is rarely used as a control measure when outbreaks affect rural communities; this is largely due to the fear of a public outcry and possibly political backlash. Movement ban of affected livestock out of the province is usually the preferred control measure. However, on commercial farms, depopulation is usually carried out as most farms are usually covered by insurance and it is easy for the government to pay compensation to such enterprises.\" - Mod.AS   .

Epizootic hemorrhagic disease or \"EHD\" is spreading in multiple counties. Reports of dead deer are being called in to fish and wildlife officials across the state. The virus is insect borne and can fatally affect red deer and sheep. The disease is not contagious but can become widespread due to insect activity, specifically the midge fly. Dry hot weather is usually blamed for EHD as deer are forced to move to bodies of water where carriers of the disease reside. \"Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease is not transmittable to people or pets,\" Dr Iga Stasiak, state wildlife veterinarian for Kentucky Fish and Wildlife. \"However, we always recommend that hunters avoid eating venison from deer that were obviously sick.\" The counties hardest hit have been Magoffin, Floyd and Knott counties. Deer can exhibit signs of illness within 24 to 72 hours after receiving a bite from an infected midge. Infected deer may appear sluggish and unresponsive to humans. EHD causes dehydration and fever in deer, which causes the animals to seek water. Infected deer are often found dead near bodies of water. Kentucky last had significant outbreaks of EHD in 2007 and 2012. Contact Fish and Wildlife if you find a deceased deer at 1-800-858-1549.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Epizootic hemorrhagic disease EHD is a viral disease which is often fatal to many wild ruminants, especially cervids. The acute, infectious disease is usually characterized by extensive hemorrhages. EHD is NOT the same as bluetongue disease. Although presentation may be similar, these diseases are antigenically very different. As long as this disease has been around, it seems we should be able to find a vaccine for this disease, especially one capable of delivering immunity though feed or some other source that we could protect some of the deer. While that may sound like a dream or unrealistic, it is nevertheless really hard on land owners and deer lovers to continually come across the sick or dead deer. Some would argue it is nature's way of thinning the herd and keeping nature in balance. But if this disease were extremely deadly and contagious to domestic livestock it would be much more likely for funds to be put toward a vaccine or preventative. On occasion we do have EHD in cattle, but it is not as frequent as in cervids. - Mod.TG Commercial vaccines are available in Japan although used primarily for cattle. Killed autogenous vaccines have been used in captive cervid herds in the United States, but the efficacy of the vaccine is unknown. For more information see  . - Mod.JH   .

Though this is the 1st detection of SLEV in Stanislaus County in more than 40 years, statewide, there have been 17 mosquito samples that have tested positive for the virus this year 2017. The samples tested positive in Fresno, Kern, Kings and Riverside counties. No people have tested positive for the virus, according to MADs. In 2016, there were 3 reports of people infected with SLEV in California. Those were the 1st cases in the state since 1997. Like West Nile virus WNV, most people who become infected with SLEV will never feel sick, according to MADs. Most people who do will experience mild flu-like symptoms. \"It is very important that people take precautions to protect themselves and their families from mosquito bites, said Dr. Julie Vaishampaya, Stanislaus County Public Health Officer. MADs researchers note WNV has been on the rise with a total of 80 mosquitoes testing positive this year in Stanislaus County. WNV has also been confirmed in 2 dead birds. There are precautions people can take to mitigate infection, including: - Dump or drain standing water. These are places mosquitoes like to lay their eggs. - Defend yourself against mosquitoes by using repellants containing DEET, Picaridin or Oil of Lemon Eucalyptus. - Avoid being outdoors at dusk and dawn. These are the times when WNV carrying mosquitoes are generally most active. - Report neglected swimming pools to your local MAD. - Use tight fitting door and window screens to keep mosquitoes from entering your home.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Louis encephalitis SLE virus transmission is occurring in 2 locations in northern California this year (2017). Fortunately, no human cases have been reported there so far this summer. SLE virus is endemic in the south western USA and sporadic cases in humans occur there infrequently. In 2015, human cases occurred in the adjoining states of Nevada and Arizona and positive mosquitoes were found in California. SLE virus was found in mosquitoes in Nevada in 2005. Wild birds are the reservoir host and mosquitoes in the genus _Culex_ are vectors that transmit SLE virus. The mosquito species in which SLEV was detected are not mentioned in the above report. Avoidance of mosquito bites and elimination of mosquito breeding sites in this area is good advice that should be heeded by the local residents. - Mod.TY  ", "dates": ["Date: Mon 7 Aug 2017 4:44 PM", "[Mon 7 Aug 2017]", "Date: Mon 7 Aug 2017 9:54 AM", "2016 there were 3 reports of people infected with SLEV in California", "Those were the 1st cases in the state since 1997", "in 2 locations in northern California this year (2017)"], "title": "St. Louis encephalitis virus - USA: (CA) "}, "689": {"sentences": "OMS | Change@WHO \u2013 Bulletin d\u2019information \u2013 mai 2014  Aller au contenu principal  Access  Home Alt+0  Navigation Alt+1  Content Alt+2  Chercher  Rechercher sur WHO.int  Submit  Recherche avanc\u00e9e  Navigation  Page d'accueil  Th&egrave;mes de sant&eacute;  Donn&eacute;es et statistiques  Centre des m&eacute;dias  Publications  Pays  Programmes et projets  Gouvernance  &Agrave; propos de l'  OMS  Language  \u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a  \u4e2d\u6587  English  Fran\u00e7ais  \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439  Espa\u00f1ol  \u00c0 propos de l'OMS  Rubriques  \u00c0 propos de l'OMS  Qui nous sommes  Ce que nous faisons  O\u00f9 nous travaillons  Gouvernance  Partenariats et collaborations  Partenariats mondiaux pour la sant\u00e9  Collaboration de l\u2019OMS avec les acteurs non \u00e9tatiques  Financement et responsabilit\u00e9  R\u00e9forme de l'OMS  Programmes et d\u00e9finition des priorit\u00e9s  R\u00e9forme de la gouvernance  R\u00e9formes en mati\u00e8re de gestion  R\u00e9forme sur les capacit\u00e9s d'urgence  Groupe consultatif  Comit\u00e9 de surveillance  Documentation  Bulletin d\u2019information sur la r\u00e9forme  Mai 2014  Janvier 2014  Septembre 2013  Avril 2013  Novembre 2012  Change@WHO Change@WHO \u2013 Bulletin d\u2019information \u2013 mai 2014  Le bulletin d'information Change@WHO suit l\u2019\u00e9volution de la r\u00e9forme \u00e0 l\u2019OMS; chaque num\u00e9ro rend compte des progr\u00e8s enregistr\u00e9s dans les trois principaux domaines de la r\u00e9forme: les programmes et la d\u00e9finition des priorit\u00e9s, la gouvernance et les r\u00e9formes gestionnaires.

They have been isolated in a hospital for close monitoring. Results of tests conducted on them will be released Wed 16 Aug 2017,\" said Health Assistant Secretary Eric Tayag said on Tue 15 Aug 2017. Earlier, Health Secretary Roselyn Ubial said only those who are exposed to the farms and fowls in San Luis are being monitored for cases of chicken-to-human transmission of bird flu virus. Up to 12 quarantine stations have been set up in affected areas. It will take 90 days for them to be declared free of bird flu, Ubial said, adding that flu vaccines could not protect humans against the bird flu virus, but could guard against flu mutation once a person was infected of bird flu. A series of test has confirmed that H5 avian influenza, not the H7 bird flu strain, hit the farms in San Carlos and Sta Rita villages, of San Luis town, Pampanga. There has been no animal-to-human transmission of the disease yet, confirmed Agriculture Secretary Manny Pi\u00f1ol. The agriculture department began culling chickens, ducks, game fowl, and quail through carbon dioxide suffocation, in San Carlos and Sta. Rita villages, San Luis town on Sat 12 Aug 2017. A total of 400 000 birds would be culled, Pi\u00f1ol estimated. Policemen and agriculture authorities have also imposed checks on all exit and entry points in 12 towns in Pampanga provinces. The transport of poultry products from 5 villages in 3 towns of Pampanga such as Mexico, San Luis, Sta. Ana has been strictly prohibited. The agriculture department is also investigating the source of the disease whether it was brought by migratory birds or by ducks smuggled from China. Governor Lilia Pineda has placed the entire Pampanga province under a state of calamity following the outbreak of avian flu. This could mean P2 billion (Dh166 million) loss for the poultry sector, but poultry owners affected by the bird flu virus will be compensated, she added. Pampanga is one of the major sources of poultry products sold in Metro Manila and Central Luzon. A report on the country's bird flu outbreak will be submitted to the Paris-based World Organization for Animal Health. A poultry owner reported the deaths of at least 15 000 quail birds in San Carlos village in April and May 2017. The disease has killed a total of 37.000 fowls since April 2017. Bird flu viruses have spread in Europe and Africa in recent months. The H7N9 strain has led to transmission to human cases, including fatalities, in China.

The death toll from cholera climbed to 1940 and the suspected cases to more than 463 000 on Sun 6 Aug 2017, said Abdulhakim Al-Kuhlani, spokesperson for the public health and population ministry in Sanaa. \"We have a national emergency plan focused on improving epidemiological surveillance, providing fast response teams and necessary medicines, and opening treatment centers across the republic,\" Al-Kuhlani said. Spokesperson for the health ministry within the legitimate government in Aden, Mohammed Mustafa Yasin, said their plan is focused on environmental sanitation. \"The efforts to contain cholera require cooperation among all sectors, like the health ministry, the cleanliness fund, civil society and media,\" Yasin elaborated. \"We are also launching a house-to-house health education campaign.\" More than a million children suffering from acute malnutrition, including almost 200 000 with severe acute malnutrition, are caught in the areas hit hardest by a deadly outbreak of cholera, Save the Children warned last week week of 1 Aug 2017. Yemeni officials said the number of suspected cases per day has slightly decreased in recent weeks in some areas thanks to quick and effective interventions. \"In Aden, we are now receiving tens of suspected cases a day. In the 1st months of the outbreak, we were receiving hundreds of suspected cases a day,\" said Yasin. Collapsing healthcare and sanitation systems, damaged water infrastructure, and malnutrition, all direct consequences of a war continuing for more than 2.5 years, are making people more vulnerable to cholera, agencies said, while calling for scaling up aid to the country.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\.

Ciguatera poisoning, which causes symptoms such as tingling and numbness in fingers and toes, around lips, tongue, mouth and throat; nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and/or abdominal cramps; joint pains and headache; and breathing difficulty, has also been reported in Belize, and over the past 4 days, 2 alerts have been issued by the Ministry of Health in Belize, following reports of cases cropping up, which have been linked to the consumption of barracuda fish. In the 1st alert, issued on Fri 18 Aug 2017, the Ministry of Health reported that \"suspected fish poisoning (Ciguatera poisoning) was detected in people that had eaten fish bought from a fish vendor in Ladyville, Belize District.\" In the 2nd alert, issued on Tue 23 Aug 2017, the Ministry said that 2 further cases of suspected Ciguatera poisoning, linked to the consumption of the large predatory fish, had been identified. \"Investigations conducted so far reveal that the barracuda fish from the Turneffe Islands area has been the sole carrier of the ciguaxtoin or poison,\" the alert said. It warned that toxic fish does not have any odor or taste and cooking and freezing does not eliminate the toxin. According to the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ciguatera fish poisoning (or ciguatera) is an illness caused by eating fish that contain toxins produced by a marine microalgae called _Gambierdiscus toxicus_, associated with corals. Whereas the barracuda is believed to be the culprit for the most recent bouts of illness caused by the toxin, other fish may also carry the toxin, including coral trout, red snapper, donu, parrot fish, grouper, Spanish mackerel, red emperor, wrasse, reef cod, sturgeon fish, trevally and moray eel. The CDC also lists blackfin snapper, cubera snapper, dog snapper, greater amberjack, hogfish, horse-eye jack, and king mackerel among the fish which have been known to carry ciguatoxins. \"Anyone who consumes fish contaminated with the ciguatera toxin will become ill,\" the Ministry's alert said, adding that, \"The gastrointestinal or stomach symptoms normally appear within 24 hours of exposure and those of the nervous system can appear 1 to 2 days later.\" Although some symptoms may last only a few days, in some cases, the toxin can continue to affect those who ingest it for months. The CDC says people who have ciguatera may find that cold things feel hot and hot things feel cold. The Belize Ministry of Health has shared some guidelines for reducing the risk of CFP. It advises the following: - Avoid eating larger reef fish that have a greater likelihood of carrying ciguatoxins, especially the barracuda. - Limit the weight of a fish to less than 11 pounds, as ciguatera fish poisoning occurs more frequently in larger fish. - Eat other types of fish not listed above. - Avoid eating the head, roe or fish egg, liver, or other organs of the fish, as it is where the highest level of toxin is present.

In Romania, investigations of recent poultry deaths have, to date, identified the H5 subtype of avian influenza virus. Further testing is under way to determine the strain and whether the virus is highly pathogenic. Authorities in the two countries have undertaken control measures as recommended by OIE and FAO. WHO is sending diagnostic reagents and other supplies to support testing in national laboratories. Viruses from both outbreaks have been sent for further analysis to the Central Veterinary Laboratory Agency-Weybridge (UK), which is an OIE/FAO reference laboratory. Viruses are also being sent to WHO reference laboratories for comparison with human H5N1 isolates from Asia.  Public health implications  The spread of H5N1 to poultry in new areas is of concern as it increases opportunities for further human cases to occur. However, all evidence to date indicates that the H5N1 virus does not spread easily from birds to infect humans. WHO advises countries experiencing outbreaks in poultry to follow certain precautions, particularly during culling operations, and to monitor persons with a possible exposure history for fever or respiratory symptoms. The early symptoms of H5N1 infection mimic those of many other common respiratory illnesses, meaning that false alarms are likely.  The WHO level of pandemic alert remains unchanged at phase 3: a virus new to humans is causing infections, but does not spread easily from one person to another.  WHO continues to recommend that travellers to areas experiencing outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 in poultry should avoid contact with live animal markets and poultry farms. Large amounts of the virus are known to be excreted in the droppings from infected birds. Populations in affected countries are advised to avoid contact with dead migratory birds or wild birds showing signs of disease.  Direct contact with infected poultry, or surfaces and objects contaminated by their droppings, is considered the main route of human infection. Exposure risk is considered highest during slaughter, defeathering, butchering, and preparation of poultry for cooking. There is no evidence that properly cooked poultry or poultry products can be a source of infection.  Countries located along migratory routes need to be vigilant for signs of disease in wild and domestic birds. Recent events make it likely that some migratory birds are now implicated in the direct spread of the H5N1 virus in its highly pathogenic form.

The child developed fever, headache, arthralgia, muscle pain, and vomiting on 29 Jun 2017. Upon presentation to a local clinic on 30 Jun 2017, he was febrile and lethargic with moderate epistaxis (nose bleed). Serial blood samples (the 2nd one collected on 13 July 2017) were tested by the Institut Pasteur Dakar, which revealed an increase in antibodies (IgM and IgG) against the CCHF virus, confirming a recent infection. The investigation revealed that the possible source of infection was 2 cows purchased from a city market less than 3 months prior to the event. A high prevalence of ticks was observed within the implicated herd, of which samples were collected for testing results pending. Another 15 suspected cases were identified in the community, all of whom tested negative and were excluded. Previous seroprevalence studies have highlighted that CCHF is focally endemic throughout Senegal and neighboring countries. Sporadic human infections may be expected in people with regular contact with livestock in endemic areas, but these are preventable through use of repellents, protective clothing, and gloves to prevent tick bites, and avoiding contact with blood and body fluids of livestock.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. CCHF is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and Asian countries south of the 50th parallel north  the geographical limit of the principal tick vector. The hosts of the CCHF virus include a wide range of wild and domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats. Animals become infected by the bite of infected ticks and the virus remains in their bloodstream for about one week after infection, allowing the tick-animal-tick cycle to continue when another tick bites. Although a number of tick genera are capable of becoming infected with CCHF virus, ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_ are the principal vector. The CCHF virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians. Human-to-human transmission is possible. In May 2017, Senegal reported 2 cases of CCHF were reported that had been imported from Mauritania with history of exposure to ticks on household livestock. To prevent outbreaks of CCHF, public awareness campaigns aimed at the populations most at risk  livestock farmers, butchers, and health personnel  must be conducted, and the epidemiologic alert systems must be strengthened. In addition, conditions that enhance maintenance of the virus in nature and its transmission to humans must be better understood so adequate control measures can be developed. - Mod. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ

Unpasteurized milk recall from Wise County dairy </strong><br> The Texas Department of State Health Services DSHS is working with a specific raw milk dairy in Wise County to recall raw, or unpasteurized, milk due to laboratory evidence that it contains harmful bacteria. DSHS is investigating additional illnesses that may be connected to this product and advising people who consumed milk from this dairy since 1 Jun 2017 to consult with their health care provider. A person who drank milk from K-Bar Dairy in Paradise, Texas has been hospitalized for an infection of a strain of the _Brucella_ bacterium. The patient's only known exposure is through the raw milk, and milk samples taken at that dairy have also tested positive for _Brucella_. The dairy, which is cooperating fully with the investigation, is contacting customers and telling them to discard any milk they have on hand. Because the dairy does not have record of all customers, DSHS is alerting the public about the recall. The department has also issued a health alert asking health care providers to be aware of possible _Brucella_ infections in patients, ask about the consumption of raw milk if considering a _Brucella_ diagnosis, and order appropriate diagnostic testing. _Brucella_ can cause a range of symptoms including fever, sweats, headache, muscle and joint pain, loss of appetite, and fatigue. Symptoms can persist for a long time or may come and go repeatedly. Less common symptoms include inflammation of the heart, swelling of the liver and spleen, neurologic symptoms, and in pregnant women, miscarriage. Pregnant women, very young children, older adults, and people with suppressed immune systems are at an increased risk of serious illness due to _Brucella_. People who consumed milk from K-Bar Dairy since 1 Jun 2017 are considered to be at high risk of brucellosis and should contact their health care provider and explain the situation. DSHS recommends testing people with symptoms who consumed the product and treating those who test positive. People who consumed milk from this dairy but have no symptoms should discuss the issue with their provider and monitor themselves for fever and other symptoms. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ This 2nd release from Texas Department of State Health Services underscores the relationship of the dairy's unpasteurized milk and the illness by stating that milk samples also yielded _Brucella_(the \"smoking\" gun). Additionally, additional illnesses are also being evaluated. The species of _Brucella_ identified has not been stated. Classically, _B. abortus_ is associated with cattle but campaigns to eradicate _B. abortus_ from cattle in the USA which began in 1934 have been quite successful. In 2011, commenting on a cluster of _B. abortus_ in cattle in Starr County, Texas ( ) it was stated that, \"Currently, the only known reservoir for bovine brucellosis in the United States is in elk and bison in the Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA) located in parts of Montana, Idaho and Wyoming.\" With that in mind, ProMED would like confirmation of the species of brucellosis identified and whether goat's milk was the source rather than cow's milk as _B. melitensis_ could be the organism. In a past report of brucellosis from cow's milk in the USA (Brucellosis, human - USA (03): (MA), unpasteurized milk, NOT http://promedmail.org/post/20120128.1024159), further evaluation of the organism revealed it not to be _Brucella_ at all. - Mod.LL While the species of _Brucella_ has not been released, it is not necessarily _B. abortus_. This would have other serious animal impacts regarding movement of beef and/or dairy animals. Texas Animal Health Commission has not released a statement regarding _B. abortus_ infected animals. They are usually very quick to make an announcement. However, it is possible the _Brucella_ species in the milk may be _B. suis_. While _B. suis_ is generally thought to infect pigs, it has been shown to infect cattle as well. This occurs especially as the wild hogs circulate through grazing pastures and may come in contact with cattle. Other states have also had issues with _B. suis_ appearing in bovines. - Mod.TG ", "dates": ["Date: Mon 14 Aug 2017", "from this dairy since 1 Jun 2017 to consult with their health care", "People who consumed milk from K-Bar Dairy since 1 Jun 2017 are", "org/post/20120128", "1024159) further evaluation of"], "title": "Brucellosis - USA (06): (TX) unpasteurized milk, alert,\r\n\trecall, RFI "}, "342": {"sentences": "<br><br><strong>   Sat 29 Jul 2017 Source: Outbreak News Today edited _Vibrio vulnificus_ updates: Mobile County and Florida -</strong><br> Mobile County (Alabama) The 1st case involved a Mobile County resident who consumed raw oysters in another state in March 2017.

Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in salt water, and acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not imply that the water is contaminated by sewage. Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc., followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis. The \"primary septicemia\" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 percent). Over 70 percent of infected individuals have distinctive bullous skin lesions (shown at  ).\" There are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination) and that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just get gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ can involve more northern geographical areas if the area is affected by a substantial heat wave. - Mod.LL ProMED HealthMaps: Alabama: Florida:  ", "dates": ["Date: Sat 29 Jul 2017", "The other 2 cases took place during June 2017 and came from wound", "last report bringing the total to 12 for 2017 to date"], "title": "Vibrio vulnificus - USA (07): (AL, FL) "}, "452": {"sentences": "<br><br><strong>   Thu 10 Aug 2017 Source: Polio Eradication Initiative edited Poliovirus Weekly Update as of: 9 Aug 2017, World Health Organization -</strong><br> New wild poliovirus cases reported this week: 0 Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2017: 8 Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2016: 37 New cVDPV cases reported this week: 0 Total number of cVDPV cases in 2017: 37 Total number of cVDPV cases in 2016: 5 Headlines - The United Kingdom has announced 100 million in new funding to polio eradication to meet the final challenges. - Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: 2 positive environmental samples of wild poliovirus type 1 in Pakistan and 1 in Afghanistan; 3 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus in Syria and 3 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Details in country-specific sections below. Afghanistan - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains five. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 19 Jun 2017 from Kandahar. One new WPV1-positive environmental sample was reported in the past week, collected on 7 Jul 2017 from Lashkargah in Helmand province. - Preparations are continuing for the next round of the National Immunization Days starting on 14 Aug 2017. There is special focus on ensuring high quality vaccination drive in the southern region of the country. Pakistan - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week; the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains three. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on 11 Jun 2017, from Killa Abdullah, Balochistan. - Two new WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week, the most recent collected on 19 Jul 2017, from Karachi in Sindh. - A special vaccination round is being implemented during August 2017 targeting areas with recent polio cases and positive environmental samples. These include Rawalpindi / Islamabad and demographically connected areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Quetta Block and parts of Karachi. - Under the National Emergency Action Plan for polio eradication, the country is planning to implement 2 nation-wide and 2 sub-national vaccination rounds from September to December 2017. Nigeria - No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 21 Aug 2016 in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno. - Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016). - Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance. Lake Chad Basin - The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno, Nigeria in 2016) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) (Borno and Sokoto provinces in Nigeria in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak. - Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region. Central Africa - Three new cases of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). This brings the total number of cases this year to 7, in 2 separate outbreaks of cVDPV2: in Haut Lomami province (5 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on 13 Jun 2017); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on 26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017, with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May 2017). - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time. Outbreak response is taking place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols, targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 across the 2 provinces. - The 1st mOPV2 round was implemented on 27-29 Jun 2017 in the 2 affected provinces; and the 2nd mOPV2 round ran from 13-15 Jul 2017 in Haut Lomami and 20-22 Jul 2017 in Maniema. - Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries. Middle East - In Syria, 3 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were officially confirmed at WHO headquarters in the past week, bringing the total number of cases in this outbreak to 30. Onset of paralysis of these cases is between 3 Mar 2017 and 16 Jun 2017. 29 of the cases are from Mayadeen district, Deir Ez-Zour governorate, and 1 case is from Talabyad district, Raqqa governorate. - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized and implemented, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Two vaccination campaigns are planned for both Deir Ez-Zour and Raqqa governorates. If there is geographic spread, the extent of these campaigns will have to be adjusted. - The 1st mOPV2 round in Deir Ez-Zour was successfully carried out between 22-26 Jul 2017. Independent post-campaign monitoring reflected coverage of 88.4 percent (based on caregiver recall). The 2nd round is planned for 19-23 Aug 2017, and will include mOPV2 and IPV.- Raqqa Governorate plans to start mOPV2 campaigns on 12 Aug 2017. - Plans are being finalized to mitigate the risks of further spread from the outbreak zone to neighbouring areas and countries, including immunization of at-risk populations in northwest Syria, Turkey and Lebanon.

According to this weekly update from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), there are 2 active transmission sites related to cVDPVs - one in Syria and the 2nd in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). Both are areas that have had transmission identified from earlier this year (2017). In the case of Syria, it appears that the transmission of the cVDPV has been localized to the Deir al Zour governorate with a single case having been reported from the neighboring Raqqah governorate (suggesting this may have been an isolated importation). To date there have been 30 cases of polio attributable to the cVDPV in Syria. In the case of the DR Congo, while cases had been identified in 2 provinces, it appears that circulation has continued in only one of the 2 provinces - Haut Lomami province. As the dates of onset of most recent confirmed cases in both Syria and the DR Congo are in mid-June, and control vaccination campaigns were begun in mid-July (in Syria) and late June and mid July (in the 2 affected provinces in the DR Congo), and we are now in early August, it would not be surprising to learn of additional cases over the coming weeks that were infected before the immunization campaigns were completed.. Also noteworthy in the above update is the identification of 2 WPV1 positive environmental samples in Karachi, Sindh Pakistan. The most recent reported (and confirmed) case of polio due to WPV1 in Sindh was in 2016. ( ).  So the identification of the WPV1 in environmental samples is of concern as it indicates an infected individual(s) has been in the area and might be a source for continued tranmission of the WPV1.. -

The die-off alarmed residents of the nearby apartments, who worried that some kind of chemical exposure may have been to blame. But Andy Taylor, of Boulder's Water Quality and Environmental Services, said that after an inspection of the south Boulder lake on Mon 24 Jul 2017 afternoon, officials believe it was algae that ultimately killed the fish. \"That pulls the oxygen out of the water,\" Taylor explained. Taylor said tests at the small lake at 1000 W. Moorhead Circle showed high pH levels and that the water temperature was 85 degrees. \"That's more basic than the fish prefer,\" Taylor said. Crews contracted by Boulder Housing Partners  which manages the privately owned property  were on scene cleaning up the dead fish, but it may take them until Tue 25 Jul 2017 to fully clean the pond. \"There's a lot of fish in there,\" Taylor said. Another firm hired by Boulder Housing Partners is conducting water quality and algae testing. Boulder officials said there is nothing so far to suggest there's any larger risk to the city's stormwater system. Melissa Miller said she 1st noticed the dead fish Sun 23 Jul 2017 morning while walking around the lake, which is surrounded by the Tantra Lake Apartments. \"It just smelled like fish,\" Miller said. \"I thought maybe a fisherman had left a fish on the grass, but then I saw all of them.\" The dead fish, ranging from small ones measuring only a few inches to larger fish that were several feet long, could still be seen Mon 24 Jul 2017 morning floating by the hundreds in the lake, and the smell of dead fish lingered in the air. Miller has lived in the area for 5 years and had never seen anything like it. \"It's extremely frightening,\" Miller said. \"It's usually a mecca of wildlife.\" The guppies, frogs and turtles in the pond seemed unaffected, but Miller also said that she didn't see any of the larger fish dead until Mon 24 Jul 2017. Resident James Hougen said the fact that different sizes and species of fish had all died was especially puzzling. \"It's extremely concerning,\" he said. \"You have to wonder if it's some sort of chemical in the water.\" Jeremy Durham, executive director of with Boulder Housing Partners, late Mon 24 Jul 2017 afternoon released a statement, saying, \"We appreciate everyone's patience while we work to address things in a safe and efficient manner.\" Miller said she called the apartment complex's management office on Sun 23 Jul 2017 but had not heard back. \"It makes you worried about your own pets,\" she said. \"What if your dog eats the grass? I don't know what this is.\" Before Boulder officials examined Tantra Lake, Colorado Parks and Wildlife spokeswoman Jennifer Churchill speculated the fish deaths could be weather-related. \"It is likely a summer fishkill due to the high heat,\" Churchill said. Summer fishkills have happened before in Boulder County, including once in Gunbarrel and once in Louisville. Byline: Mitchell Byars  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\.

It's important that people know that pertussis is still spreading, and it's useful for people to know how to protect themselves and others. Hanley said there are 3 main pillars for protection: immunization, staying away from others until you're no longer contagious, and using antibiotics to reduce the spread of the disease. Immunization is the most effective way to lower the risk of whooping cough, said Hanley. It's especially important for infants and pregnant women to get the vaccine, he said. While antibiotics can help reduce the spread of whooping cough, people are still contagious for approximately 5 days after they start the treatment. \"Pertussis is very contagious, and, unfortunately, it's contagious for quite awhile,\" said Hanley. He urges people to keep this in mind when they start thinking about going back to work or sending their kids to daycare or other group settings.

He presented with fever, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, and lower back pain. The other patient from Greece had been in our service for the previous 2 weeks and now is at home in good condition.

Authorities closed all of Lake Wildwood's public beaches last week week of 1 Aug 2017 after water testing confirmed reports linking _E. coli_ infections to the lake's Main Beach, also called Commodore Park. The county also advised against any swimming in the lake. As of Wed 9 Aug 2017, 14 people, 11 children and 3 adults, are believed to have contracted enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ after visiting the Main Beach and, in many cases, ingesting lake water, according to the Nevada County Public Health Department. Lab results so far confirm 11 of those 14 cases are connected to the lake's bacteria. By Tue 8 Aug 2017, 9 people had been hospitalized in connection with the outbreak, county Public Health Coordinator Patti Carter said. 6 had been discharged by Wednesday evening 9 Aug 2017. 4 sickened children developed a serious condition called hemolytic uremic syndrome, which can lead to potentially fatal kidney failure and anemia. Most people with the syndrome recover, according the public health department. Based on recommendations from the California Department of Public Health and the CDC, the county said, the lake's beaches will reopen when contamination levels in the water become safe and after 3 \"incubation periods\" pass since the latest date someone was exposed to the bacteria. An incubation period is the time it takes for someone to begin showing symptoms after ingesting _E. coli_. That means the lake could open 23 Aug 2017 at the earliest, given that 23 Jul 2017 was the last known day someone was exposed to the _E. coli_, the public health department said. \"Unfortunately, this is a natural bathing area, and unlike a swimming pool, chemicals cannot be added to remedy the _E. coli_ bacteria,\" Amy Irani, the county's environmental health director, told The Bee last week week of 1 Aug 2017. \"Time is what is needed, and thus the closures will remain in effect until further notice.\" The county's Environmental Health Department is testing Lake Wildwood's water twice each week at 8 locations to monitor contamination. Results from samples taken Mon 7 Aug 2017, showed unusually high levels of sickness-causing bacteria at 7 spots, with the highest concentrations around Meadow Park, the county reported. Bacteria levels in that area were more than 12 times the minimum needed for beach closure. All 5 of Lake Wildwood's public beaches remain closed as a precaution even though only 3 of the beaches are being repeatedly tested, the county's public health department said. Authorities are investigating the source of the _E. coli_, testing feces found in the area and sand, as well as water sources that feed into the lake. The county also tested nearby wastewater and canals. Byline: Hannah Knowles  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\.

It is not stated whether the organism is serotype O157:H7 or one of the other serotypes that produce Shiga toxin. Although the posting states that bacterial levels in the water were above \"safe\" limits, the results are likely reflective of an overall coliform level not of Shiga toxin producing _E. coli_ specifically, but does reflect fecal contamination. - Mod.

The purpose of this HAN Health Alert Network Advisory is to notify public health departments and healthcare facilities and to provide guidance to healthcare providers of the increase in reported cases. Please disseminate this information to healthcare providers in hospitals and emergency rooms, to primary care providers, and to microbiology laboratories. Healthcare providers should consider a diagnosis of cyclosporiasis in patients with prolonged or remitting-relapsing diarrheal illness. Testing for _Cyclospora_ is not routinely done in most US laboratories, even when stool is tested for parasites. Healthcare providers must specifically order testing for _Cyclospora_, whether testing is requested by ova and parasite (O&P) examination, by molecular methods, or by a gastrointestinal pathogen panel test. Cyclosporiasis is a nationally notifiable disease; healthcare providers should report suspect and confirmed cases of infection to public health authorities.<br><br><strong> Background </strong><br> Cyclosporiasis is an intestinal illness caused by the parasite _Cyclospora cayetanensis_. People can become infected with _Cyclospora_ by consuming food or water contaminated with the parasite; it is not transmitted directly from one person to another person. The most common symptom of cyclosporiasis is watery diarrhea, which can be profuse. Other common symptoms include anorexia, fatigue, weight loss, nausea, flatulence, abdominal cramping, and myalgia; vomiting and low-grade fever may also occur. Symptoms of cyclosporiasis begin an average of 7 days (range: 2 days to 2 weeks or longer) after ingestion of the parasite. If untreated, the illness may last for a few days to a month or longer, and may have a remitting-relapsing course. The treatment of choice for cyclosporiasis is trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). No effective alternative treatments have yet been identified for persons who are allergic to or cannot tolerate TMP/SMX, thus observation and symptomatic care is recommended for these patients. Cyclosporiasis occurs in many countries but is more common in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Previous outbreaks in the United States have been linked to various types of imported fresh produce (such as, basil, cilantro, mesclun lettuce, raspberries, and snow peas). To date, no commercially frozen or canned produce has been implicated. In the United States, most of the reported cases and outbreaks have occurred during the spring and summer months, especially during May through August or September. As of 2 Aug 2017, 206 cases of _Cyclospora_ infections have been reported to CDC in persons who became infected in the United States and became ill on or after 1 May 2017. These cases have been reported from 27 states, most of which have reported relatively few cases. 18 cases reported hospitalization; no deaths have been reported. At this time, no specific vehicle of interest has been identified, and investigations to identify a potential source of infection are ongoing. It is too early to say whether cases of _Cyclospora_ infection in different states are related to each other and/or to the same food item(s). The number of cases (206) reported in 2017, is higher than the number of cases reported by this date in 2016. As of 3 Aug 2016, 88 _Cyclospora_ infections had been reported in persons who became infected in the United States and became ill on or after 1 May 2016.<br><br><strong> Recommendations for healthcare providers </strong><br> - Consider a diagnosis of cyclosporiasis in patients who have prolonged or remitting-relapsing diarrheal illness. - If indicated, healthcare providers should specifically order testing for _Cyclospora_, whether testing is requested by ova and parasite (O&P) examination, by molecular methods, or by a gastrointestinal pathogen panel test. Several stool specimens may be required because _Cyclospora_ oocysts may be shed intermittently and at low levels, even in persons with profuse diarrhea. - Report cases to local health departments. Contact the local health department if assistance is needed with reporting or submitting specimens.

However, 15-18 children continue to die every day at the 950-bed Gorakhpur's Baba Raghav Das (BRD) Medical College and Hospital; a third of these deaths are due to encephalitis. Japanese encephalitis (JE) and the deadlier acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) became the national buzzwords after 30 children died between 9-11 Aug 2017 in BRD Medical College, Gorakhpur's largest government hospital, amid allegations that a private company contracted to supply oxygen cylinders cut supply over a payment dispute. A total of 97 of the 1527 child deaths between 1 Jul-14 Aug 2017 were from the mosquitoborne Japanese encephalitis and AES, which is caused by other toxins, viruses and bacteria, among others. JE and AES deaths continue to account for roughly 2/3 of child deaths from all causes. Encephalitis is the swelling in the brain that leads to sudden high fever, headache, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, seizures, spastic paralysis and, finally, death. >From 1 Jan-22 Aug 2017, the hospital recorded 625 AES admissions, of which 158 children died. More than 30 percent of the cases and deaths were reported during July and till mid August 2017. Of the 2729 child deaths from all causes in 2016, close to 45 per cent (1218) occurred when monsoon peaks between July and October. On 14 Aug 2017, 24 deaths occurred within a single day, when there were no disruptions of any kind. \"On an average, there are between 10 and 20 deaths each day at this time of the year. AES has got very high mortality rate of around 30 percent and since this is a referral hospital, all the infants admitted in the neonatal wards are brought in when they are critical,\" said a senior administrative official, requesting anonymity. The newly-appointed principal, Dr PK Singh, says, \"We get very sick babies because most parents seek local remedies and treatment from quacks before they bring their children to the hospital. Add to it the load of sick newborns and pre-term babies and deaths go up.\" \"You might find 2-3 babies on one bed or 2 babies in one incubator but that's because we try not to turn anyone away. We provide the best of care possible under the given circumstances, which is not enough at times,\" said Dr Singh. \"Since children are vaccinated against mosquito-borne JE, deaths have gone down. Most deaths are now from AES,\" said Dr Harish Tiwari, lecturer, department of community medicine, BRD. byline: Rhythma Kaul  communicated by: ProMED-mail The encephalitis situation in Gorakhpur's BRD Medical College hospital has been, and remains, confusing. As mentioned above, the deaths of 30 children are attributed to lack of supplementary oxygen. However, 97 of 1527 childhood deaths between 1 Jul-14 Aug 2017 are attributed to JE and AES, and since then 2/3 of childhood deaths are due to JE and AES. These apparently contradictory statistics are being explained (rightly or wrongly) on the assumption that the 2/3 proportion refers to deaths since 14 Aug 2017. Clarification would be appreciated. - Mods.TY/SH The report above also indicates that since children have been vaccinated against JE virus infections, deaths have gone down. The proportions of these deaths due to JE and to AES are not indicated. AES continues to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_), and lychee fruit consumption. Recently, scrub typhus has been implicated in many AES cases. Clearly, prospective studies are needed to define the causes of AES.

He said the woman had been suffering from extreme headaches, nausea and drowsiness for some days, adding that she was taken to the Patel Hospital in Gulshan-e-Iqbal on Sat 29 Jul 2017 when her condition worsened. \"Within 24 hours of her admission to the hospital, she succumbed to the deadly infection.\" According to health officials, _N. fowleri_ has killed 46 people across Sindh since 2011. Meanwhile, a recent study by some Pakistani experts at the University of Dammam in Saudi Arabia and the University of Karachi found that between 2008 and 2015, 110 people in Sindh died due to primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) caused by _N. fowleri_. Published in the Archives of Pharmacy Practices last year 2016, the study found that the highest number of cases was reported in 2012 when 22 people in Pakistan died of the waterborne infection. The researchers said majority of the _N. fowleri_ deaths in the country between 2008 and 2015 occurred in the month of July. The mean temperature of the month was between 35\u00b0C and 39\u00b0C 95\u00b0F and 102.2\u00b0F, while the majority of the cases were reported in Karachi. Saudi Arabia-based Pakistani specialists said that no individual who contracted the disease was able to survive, adding that adults between the ages of 26 and 45 years were the most affected. All of the deaths occurred in the Muslim community, concluded the study. \"In the beginning, PAM-related deaths occurred mainly in males,\" says the study. \"However, female deaths have also been reported recently. Cross tabulating the variable of year with patient age group revealed that individuals from all ages ... were reported dead due to the pathogen.\" The study by foreign experts further revealed that chlorination of the municipality water supply in Karachi was below the World Health Organization recommended level of 0.5 parts per million (ppm). Data from 913 water samples taken from different parts of the city in 2012 reported 201 water samples to have chlorination below 0.5ppm. In 2014, another 2094 water samples were drawn across the city and reported low chlorination. The subsequent year 2015 also reported similar results. On the other hand, leading water technologist and expert Dr Ahsan Siddiqui said that due to deteriorating water supply lines in Karachi and other issues, chlorinated water does not reach the consumers. He advised the people to clean their underground and overhead water tanks as well as to use liquid bleach regularly. \"It is found that _N. fowleri_ remains present in the layer of mud in the water tanks ... and whenever it finds favourable temperatures, it activates.\" He said 10 drops of liquid bleach killed all the pathogens and microorganisms in one cubic feet of water containing 28 litres 7.39 gallons, reiterating the need for regular cleaning of underground and overhead water tanks to get rid of N fowleri colonies. byline: M Waqar Bhatti  communicated by: ProMED-mail The 1st case of primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) was detected in Karachi in 2012  . Only 4 out of 143 known infected individuals in the USA have survived between 1962 and 2016 (over 97 per cent fatality rate)  . The morbidity and mortality associated with PAM is likely to be increased unless prompt measures to clean water reservoirs in residents and mosques and disinfect water. Most _Naegleria fowleri_ infections are associated with swimming in warm freshwater lakes and rivers. However, very rarely, _Naegleria fowleri_ has caused deaths associated with tap or faucet water going up the nose  . Naegleria fowleri can grow in public and private water tanks and pipes, especially where little or no disinfectant (like chlorine or chloramine) is present. It can also grow in the pipes and water heaters of homes and buildings. _Naegleria fowleri_ infections have been reported when people put their heads underwater, rinse their sinuses through the nose, and cleanse their noses during religious practices using contaminated tap or faucet water. PAM and _Naegleria fowleri_ infection can be diagnosed in the laboratory by detecting:  - _Naegleria fowleri_ organisms in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), biopsy, or tissue specimens, or  - _Naegleria fowleri_ nucleic acid in CSF, biopsy, or tissue specimens, or  - _Naegleria fowleri_ antigen in CSF, biopsy, or tissue specimens  . Because of the rarity of the infection and difficulty in initial detection, about 75 per cent of diagnoses are made after the death of the patient. Based on the treatment regimens used in the survivors, the following combination of drugs is recommended for treatment of PAM in various combinations; amphotericin B, azithromycin, fluconazole, rifampin, miltefosine and dexamethasone  . - Mod.UBA   .

Legionnaires' disease cannot be spread from person to person.

disease earlier this week, the South Chungcheong provincial government said on Tuesday 1 Aug 2017. The 24 year old man, who had been working at a livestock farm in Hongseong, a town in South Korea's central province of South Chungcheong officially Chungcheongnam-do, was diagnosed with severe fever and thrombocytopenia syndrome, or SFTS, and treated for the disease before he died on Sunday 30 Jul 2017. According to local government officials, the worker visited the emergency room of a nearby hospital on 24 Jul 2017 complaining of fever, chills and loss of appetite. He was transferred to a general hospital in Cheonan, a city in the same province, the same day as he showed symptoms of fever and thrombocytopenia low blood platelet count. The provincial government has reported 14 cases of the illness so far this year 2017, and 5 of them died. SFTS is a new infectious disease confirmed in South Korea, Japan and China. South Korea has seen cases of the disease increasing. The number of people infected with the disease was 36 in 2014, 55 in 2014, 79 in 2015 and 79 in 2016, with the death toll reaching 17 in 2013, 16 in 2014, 21 in 2015 and 19 in 2016. There is currently no effective medicine to treat the disease, and the best policy against it is to avoid being bitten by ticks. The transmission season in Korea is well under way this year (2017), with 14 cases reported above. The man was likely exposed to the tick while working on a livestock farm. With no vaccine available, avoidance of tick bites is the only preventive measure available. SFTS virus is a phlebovirus in the Bunyavirus family. Characterization of the virus responsible for SFTS was described first in 2011: Yu XJ, et al. Fever with thrombocytopenia associated with a novel bunyavirus in China.

There are no reported instances of human infection in connection with this case and the risk to the general public is low. Peel Public Health advises anyone who may have recently purchased a bird from a home-based Brampton aviary, or through Kijiji, to take that bird, and any other pet birds that have been in contact with it, to a veterinarian to be tested for avian chlamydiosis. Birds carrying the bacteria that cause psittacosis in humans and avian chlamydiosis in birds may appear healthy but could still be shedding the bacteria. Infected birds should be treated with antibiotics to eliminate the infection. Residents who have purchased a bird from a home-based aviary business or on Kijiji and are now experiencing fever, muscle aches and a dry cough are advised to see their family doctor. If diagnosed, psittacosis is highly treatable with antibiotics. For more information about psittacosis, visit the CDC's website.

Clearly this puts the human caretakers at risk of acquiring avian chlamydiosis also known as psittacosis in humans, which is a zoonotic disease. Generally people are exposed through air - or dust-borne organisms when cleaning the cages of infected pet birds or processing a flock. The birds shed the organism from their digestive or respiratory tracts. In people the disease usually has a respiratory characterization and progresses to flu-like symptoms. It may produce pneumonia, organ failure, and death if left untreated.

Christine Middlemiss, the NSW chief veterinary officer, said Local Land Services has placed the property near Murwillumbah under movement restrictions. \"This is the 2nd confirmed case of Hendra in NSW this year 2017, following a Hendra virus infection in an unvaccinated horse near Lismore last month July 2017,\" Middlemiss said. \"Samples from the horse were sent by a private veterinarian for laboratory analysis at DPI's Elizabeth Macarthur Agricultural Institute (EMAI) and initial test results detected the Hendra virus today Wed 2 Aug 2017. \"The 14 year old gelding was initially noticed by the owner to be lethargic and not eating properly,\" she continued. \"The horse was sampled 4 days later when it deteriorated, becoming unsteady on its feet and unwilling to move. On examination the horse also had decreased gut sounds, a temperature, and poor circulatory function.\" Hendra virus has been known to yield numerous clinical signs in horses including lethargy, respiratory distress, frothy nasal discharge, elevated body temperature (above 40\u00b0C, or 104\u00b0F), and elevated heart rate; however, authorities caution that hendra infection does not have specific signs. The virus is transmitted to horses from flying foxes, a type of fruit bat that frequents Australia, but the exact method of transmission remains unclear. The zoonotic disease is transmissible to humans and has killed 4 people since it was first discovered, including an equine veterinarian who contracted the virus after treating an affected foal in 2009. Middlemiss said this is not the 1st Hendra case to be confirmed in this area. \"All known Hendra virus cases have occurred in Queensland or northern NSW, but cases could occur wherever there are flying foxes or in horses that had recent contact with flying foxes prior to movement,\" she said. Horse owners are encouraged to discuss a Hendra virus vaccination strategy with their veterinarian. \"Vaccination remains the most effective way of reducing the risk of Hendra virus infection in horses, but good biosecurity and personal hygiene measures should always be practiced,\" Middlemiss said. \"Horses should also be kept away from flowering and fruiting trees that are attractive to bats,\" she added. \"Do not place feed and water under trees and cover feed and water containers with a shelter so they cannot be contaminated from above.\" If your horse is unwell, keep people and other animals away from the horse and call your private veterinarian immediately.  communicated by: ProMED-mail This is a zoonotic disease and has caused worry in family members of other infected premises, and in veterinarians. There are rules regarding the personal protective equipment (PPE) that veterinarians must wear. The gear can be frightening to a horse and can further put the veterinarian at risk. Lack of vaccination continues to be a problem for horses and for all humans in contact with the animals. The vaccine may appear as an added cost to the owner, but it is a huge measure of insurance of safety for all involved. - Mod.TG   .

The World Health Organization (WHO) has validated that the country has eliminated lymphatic filariasis  also known as elephantiasis  as a public health problem. Lymphatic filariasis is a mosquitoborne disease that damages the lymphatic system, leading to severe disfigurement, pain and disability. For people affected by this disease, the impacts of disfigurement and the associated stigma are profound: people often lose their livelihoods and suffer from psychological impacts such as depression and anxiety. \"Lymphatic filariasis is a dreadful disease; it causes terrible pain and suffering for those who are affected,\" said Dr Shin Young-soo, WHO regional director for the Western Pacific. \"The World Health Organization sincerely congratulates the Kingdom of Tonga for eliminating this disease as a public health problem. From today, the children of Tonga can grow up knowing that they are safe from this very nasty disease; what a wonderful achievement for the health of your people,\" Dr Shin said. This achievement in Tonga comes after decades of dedicated efforts to stop transmission of this disease, known in the local language as \"kulokula fua\". Tonga joins 7 other countries in WHO's Western Pacific Region that have been validated as having achieved elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem since WHO launched the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis in 2000: Cambodia, China, Cook Islands, Niue, the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Korea and Vanuatu. Lymphatic filariasis is classified by WHO as a neglected tropical disease (NTD). This means it is one of a diverse group of communicable diseases that thrive mainly among the poorest populations in tropical and subtropical areas. NTDs cause serious illness and in some cases death, but they are preventable. Through a series of public health strategies including preventive treatment of communities, intensive case management, vector control, control of animal diseases that can spread to humans, and provision of safe water, sanitation and hygiene, many NTDs can be controlled and eventually eliminated. The fight against lymphatic filariasis in the 17 countries and areas where it remains endemic in the Western Pacific Region is an important priority for WHO's work in this region. The disease has a long history in Tonga: the common occurrence of swelling of the leg, arm and scrotum among people in Tonga was observed in the 1770s by Captain Cook. In the 1950s, the prevalence rate of this disfiguring and debilitating disease was close to 50 per cent. Mass drug administration in the 1970s and 1980s reduced the prevalence significantly, but a series of further efforts were required over the last few decades to reach the elimination goal. \"Lymphatic filariasis' long history in Tonga makes today's victory over the disease all the sweeter. This could not have been achieved without the unwavering support and leadership of the Ministry of Health, as well as strong financial and other support from donors and partners, and most importantly, the commitment of the communities of Tonga affected by the disease,\" Dr Shin said. \"Tonga has shown us that despite significant challenges, elimination of neglected tropical diseases such as lymphatic filariasis is possible. WHO is 100 per cent committed to supporting our member states to rid our region of the scourge of this disease, so no one needs to suffer from this awful disease any longer,\" concluded Dr Shin.

The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis aims to eliminate lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem by the year 2020. The program has recently been reviewed (Ramaiah KD, Ottesen EA. Progress and impact of 13 years of the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis on reducing the burden of filarial disease. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2014; 8(11): e3319  ), and it concluded: \"The MDA programme has resulted in significant reduction of the LF burden. Extension of MDA to all at-risk countries and to all regions within those countries where MDA has not yet reached 100 per cent geographic coverage is imperative to further reduce the number of microfilaraemia and chronic disease cases and to reach the global target of interrupting transmission of LF by 2020.\" The latest progress report (2015) from the Global Programme can be found here:  . - Mod.EP   .

In interviews, 498 (74 per cent) of 672 ill people reported contact with live poultry in the week before illness started. Contact with live poultry or their environment can make people sick with salmonellosis. Live poultry can be carrying salmonella bacteria but appear healthy and clean, with no sign of illness.  communicated by: ProMED-mail Small animals such as chicks, ducklings, mice, and baby turtles are common vehicles for salmonellosis for 2 reasons: they are small enough to handle, and they carry salmonella. 2 ways to minimize the risk: aggressive handwashing after contact and choosing other pets such as dogs or cats. As has been pointed out by my colleague Mod.MHJ, it has become fashionable in the USA to have backyard poultry. So, this increase in human salmonellosis is not unexpected. From his personal professional epidemiological experience 50 years ago in the UK, such a rich variety of serotypes is typical of contaminated poultry feed. - Mod.LL   .

While previous studies have suggested that this risky hunting behavior is mostly limited to adult males, a new study appearing in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases see citation below finds that women and children also participate. Complex social and economic factors are known to influence hunting activities in sub-Saharan Africa. Since contact with animal secretions and fluids can occur through bites, scratches and handling organs during the hunting, slaughtering, and cooking of wild game, scientists have worked to understand who is involved in these behaviors and how to educate them on minimizing risks. Previous interventions have mostly focused on adult males. In the new work, Jesse Bonwitt, of the University of Durham, United Kingdom, and colleagues from the UK and Sierra Leone, carried out a study involving 4 months of fieldwork in Sierra Leone. ... The researchers found that hunting techniques used in the villages included communal and individual hunts. Hunters relied on nets, snares, traps, guns, and dogs. Descriptions of communal hunts included the ways children were involved, as well as how women played a role, for example helping to flush pray into nets, for instance. Boys often started hunting both alone and in groups from around age 7, and were motivated to do so due to pressure from their family and lack of access to other food, the researchers found. Animal carcasses were always handled with bare hands, and both men, women and children were all involved in preparing and cooking meat, over a fire. Reasons for hunting were complex, and included a need for food, crop protection, income, and social importance. ...-more Citation: Bonwitt J., Kandeh M., Dawson M., et al.

Liberia was the country hit hardest during the outbreak, reporting between 300 and 400 new cases each week at the epidemic's peak. The World Health Organization WHO announced in January 2016 that Liberia was Ebola virus disease (EVD)-free, making it the last country to be affected. However, despite the physical absence of the disease, hospitals in Liberia are still dealing with the epidemic's aftermath. One such hospital is Redemption Hospital in Monrovia, Liberia's capital. Redemption, which is government-run and offers free care to all, was the 1st hospital in Liberia to receive a patient with EVD. Its difficulty in recuperating indicates not only the overwhelming magnitude of the EVD epidemic but also the lack of preparation of the Liberian health system to handle it. Redemption, in particular, lacked the resources it needed to combat the disease. \"When EVD struck, we lacked protective equipment; running water was sporadic, and there was waste everywhere,\" Redemption administrator Dominic Rennie said. \"We had 2 or 3 patients in each bed as we wouldn't turn people away... conditions were ripe for EVD  to spread.\" During the outbreak, doctors and other healthcare workers died at alarming rates. Many of Jude Senkungu's colleagues from Redemption, including his roommate, lost their lives. \"The 1st thing I felt was shock. ... The 2nd thing was fear and despair,\" Senkungu said. \"The situation felt hopeless ... and I could hardly sleep because of the fear that I could also be a case. That's when you really kneel down and pray.\" The Redemption workers were overwhelmed by the many incoming EVD cases and feared that they, too, would contract the disease. Eventually, they stopped coming into work. The hospital closed temporarily in October of 2014, 4 months after its 1st EVD patient had come in. Thanks to aid and support from various organizations, Redemption was able to get back on its feet only a few months later. Two such organizations, the USAID Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance and an NGO called International Rescue Committee (IRC), partnered to rehabilitate and reopen Redemption's pediatric and emergency departments. ...<br><br><strong> -more Vaccine -</strong><br> 24 Jul 2017: Test-tube immune systems can speed vaccine development New technology allows scientists working on new vaccines to combat infectious diseases to test their products' effectiveness on a model immune system in a laboratory without putting the upgraded vaccine into humans. Researchers have begun building model immune systems using human cells, and this lab technique should make early vaccine trials quicker, safer and cheaper, according to scientists in the United States and Britain involved in this novel approach. The technology also has the potential to be used to mass produce antibodies in the lab to supplement real immune systems that are compromised, or battling pathogens like Ebola.

Before now, when scientists tried to get immune cells in the lab to produce antibodies, the cells would do so indiscriminately, producing all sorts of antibodies, not just the relevant ones.

Abstract. Vaccines remain the most effective tool to prevent infectious diseases. Here, we introduce an in vitro booster vaccination approach that relies on antigen-dependent activation of human memory B cells in culture. This stimulation induces antigen-specific B cell proliferation, differentiation of B cells into plasma cells, and robust antibody secretion after a few days of culture. We validated this strategy using cells from healthy donors to retrieve human antibodies against tetanus toxoid and influenza hemagglutinin (HA) from H1N1 and newly emergent subtypes such as H5N1 and H7N9. Anti-HA antibodies were cross-reactive against multiple subtypes, and some showed neutralizing activity. Although these antibodies may have arisen as a result of previous influenza infection, we also obtained gp120-reactive antibodies from non-HIV-infected donors, indicating that we can generate antibodies without prior antigenic exposure. Overall, our novel approach can be used to rapidly produce therapeutic antibodies and has the potential to assess the immunogenicity of candidate antigens, which could be exploited in future vaccine development. ...-more This new in vitro technique could facilitate development of new vaccines not only to HIV and influenza, but also Ebola virus and more, if the response predicts results when tested in vivo. - Mod.LK 26 Jul 2017: Ebola Vaccine Trial: 390 Volunteers Confirmed For Phase II In the global quest for an Ebola vaccine, Medical Research Council (MRC) in Masaka district has screened 390 people to take part in phase II of the Ebola vaccine trial.

Lancet Infect Dis 2017;17: 854-66. Comment. The Ebola virus outbreak in western Africa between 2013 and 2016 was the largest and deadliest since the discovery of the virus in 1976. The epidemic provided the impetus to fast-track several promising vaccines into clinical trials during the tail-end of the outbreak, including the rVSV\u00ce\"G-ZEBOV-GP viral vector vaccine, which was used in ring vaccination trials in Guinea. In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, D Gray Heppner and colleagues report on the safety and immunogenicity of the rVSV\u00ce\"G-ZEBOV-GP vaccine over a 6 log10 dose range. This study shows vaccine dose-dependent total and neutralising antibody titres among study participants, which persisted for up to 360 days. The rVSV\u00ce\"G-ZEBOV-GP vaccine used in the study is a recombinant, replication-competent vaccine based on vesicular stomatitis virus in which the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (G) has been replaced with the Zaire Ebola virus surface glycoprotein (GP). The Ebola virus surface glycoprotein is the main antigen used in Ebola vaccine development, with the chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAd3)-based vaccine also expressing Ebola virus glycoprotein. The strength of this study lies in its demonstration of the longevity of neutralising antibody responses after vaccination. Previous studies with this vaccine showed sharp drop-offs in antibody titres after several months, but in this study Ebola virus glycoprotein-specific antibodies were maintained for up to 360 days. Good longevity of immune responses is particularly positive for future development of Ebola virus vaccines, since it could increase the utility of the vaccine for health-care workers and people in endemic regions who are most likely to be exposed to the virus over a prolonged period. ...-more Compiled by: Celeste Whitlow   <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. - Mod.LK ", "dates": ["27 Jul 2017: Hunting-related pathogen exposure not just for adult", "Trop Dis 11(7): e0005699", "29 Jul 2017: West African hospitals still recovering from Ebola", "hardest during the outbreak reporting between 300 and 400 new cases", "temporarily in October of 2014 4 months after its 1st [EVD] patient", "24 Jul 2017: Test-tube immune systems can speed vaccine development", "was published on Mon [24 Jul 2017] in The Journal of Experimental", " (24 Jul 2017)", "(8): 2471-2490", "26 Jul 2017: Ebola Vaccine Trial: 390 Volunteers Confirmed For Phase", "The council received more than 500 volunteers but 390 managed to pass", "30 Jul 2017: Advances in Ebola virus vaccination", " (30 Jul 2017)", " 17(8):781--882 e235-e279", " Lancet Infect Dis 2017;17: 854-66", "Maps of the 3 countries affected by the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West"], "title": "Ebola update (34): research, vaccines "}, "119": {"sentences": "Mosquitoes that can spread Zika usually live in places below 6,500 feet.

Now, ecologists have identified a new threat from pesticides in the developing world. By killing off insect predators of worm-infested snails, they can raise the risk of schistosomiasis, the 2nd most common parasitic disease after malaria. \"It's a ground-breaking article,\" says Russell Stothard, a parasitologist at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in the United Kingdom, who was not involved in the research. Schistosomiasis is a debilitating disease caused by a parasitic flatworm. Some 258 million people are infected, mostly in Africa. The worm spends part of its life in freshwater snails, which release larvae that can penetrate the skin of someone swimming, bathing, or washing clothes. The centimeter-long worms spread through blood vessels, causing fever, diarrhea, anemia, and stunted growth. Immune responses can damage the kidneys and other organs. When infected people relieve themselves, the worms' eggs can spread into streams or ponds via their urine and feces. There, they hatch and seek out new snails, beginning their life cycle again. Schistosomiasis can easily be treated with drugs, but where the parasites are endemic, people quickly become reinfected. The leader of the new research, ecologist Jason Rohr of the University of South Florida in Tampa, had previously studied a similar parasitic flatworm in amphibians. His research showed that common agricultural chemicals, like fertilizer, can worsen the situation for frogs. When these chemicals enter streams and ponds, they increase the amount of algae, which is then eaten by snails that serve as a host for the flatworms. That boosts their population and leads to more parasite infections in frogs. The similar life cycles of the amphibian flatworm and the one that causes schistosomiasis made Rohr and his colleagues wonder whether agricultural pollution might also affect disease transmission. They created a simple ecological model inside 60 open tanks. After filling each with 800 liters of pond water, they added 2 species of snails that spread the schistosomiasis parasite, algae for the snails to eat, and 2 kinds of predators  crayfish and water bugs. Finally, they spiked the tanks with 3 kinds of farm chemicals  fertilizer, herbicide, and insecticide  in various combinations. The concentrations were typical of streams and ponds near corn fields in the United States. As expected, fertilizer increased the amount of algae in the tanks, which in turn swelled the number of snails. The herbicide also led to more food for the snails, because it predominately killed microscopic algae that clouded the water. When these died, the water cleared, allowing more light to reach larger algae growing on the bottom of the pond  the snails' food. An epidemiological model of schistosomiasis suggested that the increase in snail population from this typical amount of fertilizer would jack up the risk of transmission to humans by 28 percent. The insecticide, chlorpyrifos, had an even bigger effect by killing the 2 predators of the snails. Water bugs stick their heads inside the shell, bite the mollusc, inject digestive enzymes, then slurp up the remains. The 20-centimeter-long about 8 in crayfish rely on brute force, crushing the 2-centimeter-long about 0.8 in snails. \"They're absolutely voracious,\" Rohr says. With these predators gone, the snail population exploded. In such a scenario, disease risk to humans would rise 10-fold, the team reports in a preprint posted this week to bioRxiv. Although only one concentration of insecticide was added to the tanks, the model indicated that lower concentrations in ponds would still have substantial impacts on parasite transmission. The findings identify what looks like a \"strong risk factor\" for schistosomiasis, says Joanne Webster, a parasitologist at Imperial College London who was not involved. Dams have also caused an increase in schistosomiasis in many countries, because snails live in the reservoirs and irrigation channels. In some places, dams have also caused a decline in the natural predators of snails, such as fish, crayfish, and prawns. The combination of new habitat from irrigation and runoff of pesticides may be a \"perfect storm\" for schistosomiasis where agriculture is intensifying in the developing world, Rohr says. Rohr is now investigating the impact of insecticides on snail predators and disease transmission in northwest Senegal, as part of an experiment run by a research partnership called the Upstream Alliance, based in Pacific Grove, California. This project has reintroduced prawns near several villages to evaluate their efficacy in controlling freshwater snails. Rohr will study whether helping farmers switch to insecticides less toxic to prawns could lessen the burden of schistosomiasis, while maintaining food production. \"In schistosomiasis-endemic regions, we need to think more carefully about the impact of agrochemicals,\" he says. The study highlights the complex links between agriculture and disease, says Charles Godfray, a biologist at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom. By boosting agricultural productivity, pesticides and other chemicals can help raise people out of poverty and lessen malnutrition, which worsens diseases. \"The really clear thing is the importance of precision agriculture, in which agrochemicals are used as efficiently as possible, with as little runoff as possible.\" Byline: Erik Stokstad  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\.

Agrochemical pollution increases risk of human exposure to schistosome parasites. bioRxiv. 2017; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/161901 ( ) The study is important because it highlights the interdependence between agriculture, use of pesticides, and the importance of vector density for risk of infections in humans. Studies on infections in humans depending on complex ecosystems with intermediate hosts and vectors need to include all aspects of the transmission route. Once again the study shows how the use of chemicals, be it insecticides or antibiotics, in agriculture or veterinary practice, may influence ecosystems and humans important for disease transmission. - Mod.EP ", "dates": ["Date: Sun 16 Jul 2017 5:00 PM", "1101/161901"], "title": "Schistosomiasis: pesticides increase transmission\r\n\t"}, "719": {"sentences": "WHO | Uzbekistan: country profiles  Skip to main content  Access  Home Alt+0  Navigation Alt+1  Content Alt+2  Search  Search the  WHO .int site  Submit  Advanced search  Navigation  Home  Health topics  Data  Media centre  Publications  Countries  Programmes  Governance  About WHO  Language  \u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a  \u4e2d\u6587  English  Fran\u00e7ais  \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439  Espa\u00f1ol  Global Health Observatory (GHO) data  Menu  Global Health Observatory data  Data repository  Reports  Country statistics  Map gallery  Standards  Uzbekistan: country profiles  Chronic diseases  WHO Chronic Diseases and Health Promotion database  Environmental health  Estimates on the use of water sources and sanitation facilities (WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme)  WHO environmental burden of disease country profiles  Health equity monitor  Country profile  Health systems  Governance and aid effectiveness  Health financing  HIV/AIDS  AIDSinfo country fact sheets  Immunization  Immunization surveillance, assessment and monitoring online country profiles  Immunization coverage country punchcard, 2000\u20132015  Review of National Immunization Coverage (WHO/UNICEF)  Maternal, neonatal and child health  Child mortality estimates, UN Inter-Agency Group on Child Mortality Estimation  Countdown country profile (UNICEF/WHO and partners  Trends in Maternal Mortality (WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, The World Bank and the United Nations Population Division)  Noncommunicable diseases  Noncommunicable diseases country profile  Nutrition  Nutrition Landscape Information System (NLIS) indicator summary  WHO Global Database on Iodine deficiency  WHO Global Database on Anaemia  WHO Global Database on vitamin A deficiency  WHO Global data bank on infant and young child feeding  WHO Global Database on Child Growth and Malnutrition  Substance abuse and mental health  Alcohol  Resources for the prevention and treatment of substance use disorders  Tobacco control  Mental health  Tuberculosis  TB country profile  Urban health  Country profile  Violence and injuries  Road safety  Violence prevention  You are here:  Global Health Observatory (GHO) data  Country statistics  Uzbekistan  Quick Links  Sitemap  Home  Health topics  Data  Media centre  Publications  Countries  Programmes and projects  Governance  About  WHO  Help and Services  Contacts  FAQs  Employment  Feedback  Privacy  E-mail scams  WHO Regional Offices  WHO African Region  WHO Region of the Americas  WHO South-East Asia Region  WHO European Region  WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region  WHO Western Pacific Region  &#169;  WHO 2017  Back to top  Email Address  Sign up for WHO updates", "dates": [" Immunization coverage country punchcard 2000\u20132015"], "title": ["Uzbekistan: country profiles"]}, "695": {"sentences": "WHO | Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Multi-country outbreak Update 37  Skip to main content  Access  Home Alt+0  Navigation Alt+1  Content Alt+2  Search  Search the  WHO .int site  Submit  Advanced search  Navigation  Home  Health topics  Data  Media centre  Publications  Countries  Programmes  Governance  About WHO  Language  \u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a  \u4e2d\u6587  English  Fran\u00e7ais  \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439  Espa\u00f1ol  Emergencies preparedness, response  Menu  Home  Ebola outbreak in DRC  Alert and response operations  Diseases  Biorisk reduction  Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Multi-country outbreak Update 37  WHO extends its SARS-related travel advice to Beijing and Shanxi Province in China and to Toronto Canada  23 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported  As a result of ongoing assessments as to the nature of outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing and Shanxi Province, China, and in Toronto, Canada, WHO is now recommending, as a measure of precaution, that persons planning to travel to these destinations consider postponing all but essential travel. This temporary advice, which is an extension of travel advice previously issued for Guangdong Province and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China will be reassessed in three weeks time.  Following global alerts about cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), issued by WHO on 12 and 15 March, national authorities have heightened surveillance for suspect and probable cases. In many countries, prompt detection and isolation of initial cases have prevented further transmission altogether or held additional cases to a very small number.  On 27 March, WHO recommended additional measures aimed at preventing the travel-related spread of SARS. These recommended measures, which include screening of air passengers departing from certain areas, continue to apply.  On 2 April, WHO recommended that persons travelling to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Guangdong Province, China consider postponing all but essential travel. This temporary recommendation has been reassessed daily and remains in effect.  Subsequent information from the Chinese government about the magnitude of the SARS outbreaks in Beijing and Shanxi Province has been carefully reviewed by WHO. This assessment has considered the magnitude of the outbreak, including both the number of prevalent cases and the daily number of new cases, the extent of local chains of transmission, and evidence that travellers are becoming infected while in one area and then subsequently exporting the disease elsewhere. On the basis of this assessment, WHO is extending its 2 April travel advice to include Beijing and Shanxi Province.  Using the same criteria, WHO has assessed the SARS situation in Toronto, Canada. The outbreak in this area has continued to grow in magnitude and has affected groups outside the initial risk groups of hospital workers, their families and other close person-to-person contacts, although all the cases reported have identified links to known SARS cases. In addition, a small number of persons with SARS, now in other countries in the world, appear to have acquired the infection while in Toronto. On the basis of this information, WHO is also including Toronto in the extension of its SARS-related travel advice.  This advice will be re-examined in three weeks time, which is twice the maximum incubation period of SARS.  The WHO travel advice is issued in order to protect public health and reduce opportunities for further international spread. SARS is a new disease, first recognized in late February, that has spread along the routes of international air travel. As of 22 April, a cumulative total of 3947 cases had been reported from 25 countries on five continents. Precautionary measures aim to reduce the impact of SARS and contain the disease while it is still in a relatively early stage.  The SARS situation is assessed on a daily basis to determine whether other areas need to be included in the travel advice and if additional precautionary measures are required.  All WHO SARS alerts, travel advice, daily cumulative case counts and other information are available at the WHO web site.

Zika virus (or Zika) has been reported in Suriname. Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in Suriname are infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:  Women who are pregnant:  Do not travel to Suriname.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to Suriname or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers considering pregnancy:  Before you or your partner travel, talk to your health care provider about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection.  Wait before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.  If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex &ndash; or do not have sex &ndash; for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex, or do not have sex, for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy  Talk to your health care provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive.

Viruses of the H7N7 subtype have not been isolated since the late 1970s. Equine influenza viruses of both subtypes are considered to be of avian ancestry and highly pathogenic avian H5N1 has been associated with an outbreak of respiratory disease in donkeys in Egypt. In fully susceptible equidae, clinical signs include pyrexia and a harsh dry cough followed by a mucopurulent nasal discharge. In partially immune vaccinated animals, one or more of these signs may be absent. Vaccinated infected horses can still shed the virus and serve as a source of virus to their cohorts.\" \"Characteristically, influenza spreads rapidly in a susceptible population. The disease is endemic in many countries with substantial equine populations. In recent years, infection has been introduced into Australia and re-introduced into South Africa and Japan; to date New Zealand and Iceland are reported to be free of equine influenza virus.\" \"While normally confined to equidae, equine H3N8 influenza has crossed the species barrier to dogs. Extensive infection of dogs has been reported in North America where it normally produces mild fever and coughing but can cause fatal pneumonia. While equine influenza has not been shown to cause disease in humans, serological evidence of infection has been described primarily in individuals with an occupational exposure to the virus. During 2004-2006 influenza surveillance in central China (People's Rep. of) 2 equine H3N8 influenza viruses were also isolated from pigs.\" For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2017, Chapter 2.5.7, Equine Influenza at  . - Mod CRD According to OIE's epidemiological data from Israel, covering the period 2005 - 2016, Equine influenza virus H3N8 has been recorded from Israel in Jun 2006, Jan 2007 and Nov 2013. However the virus may have circulated in additional years. This is apparent from the findings presented in Reference 1. During the winter 2011-2012, the authors found in Israel 26.4 percent seroprevalence and 6.4 percent seroconversion to H3N8 and, respectively, 16.4 percent and 1 percent seroprevalence and seroconversion to H7N7. (Notably, H7N7 influenza viruses have not been detected in Israel's horse population since the late 1970s). The current outbreak, spread throughout the country, is indeed remarkable; the virus is probably more common in Israel than assumed before.<br><br><strong> - Mod AS Reference 1 </strong><br> Aharonson-Raz K, Davidson I, Porat Y, Altory A, Klement E, Steinman A.

Zika virus (or Zika) has been reported in Fiji. Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in Fiji are infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:  Women who are pregnant:  Do not travel to Fiji.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to Fiji or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers considering pregnancy:  Before you or your partner travel, talk to your health care provider about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection.  Wait before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.  If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex &ndash; or do not have sex &ndash; for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex, or do not have sex, for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy  Talk to your health care provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you&rsquo;re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Wait at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  Men are advised to wait longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.gov  Contact CDC  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  1600 Clifton Road  Atlanta ,  GA  30329-4027  USA  800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)  Contact CDC-INFO  TOP", "dates": [" Page created: April 04 2016", " Page last updated: August 08 2017", " Page last reviewed: August 08 2017", " 30329-4027", " 800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)"], "title": ["Zika Virus in Fiji "]}, "369": {"sentences": "   Tue 2 Aug 2017 Source: EurekAlert! edited The impact of climate change on the emergence and spread of infectious diseases could be greater than previously thought, according to new research by the University of Liverpool. The study, published in Nature (Scientific Reports), is the 1st large-scale assessment of how climate affects bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms and parasites (pathogens) that can cause disease in humans or animals in Europe. The results will help policy makers prioritise the surveillance for pathogens that may respond to climate change and, in turn, contribute to strengthening climate change resilience for infectious diseases. There is growing evidence that climate change is altering the distribution of some diseases, in some cases causing epidemics or making diseases spread within their natural range  for example, Zika virus in South America, or bluetongue and Schmallenberg disease in livestock in Europe. Dr Marie McIntyre, who led the project at the University's Institute of Infection and Global Health, explained: \"Although there is a well-established link between climate change and infectious disease, we did not previously understand how big the effects will be and which diseases will be most affected. Climate sensitivity of pathogens is a key indicator that diseases might respond to climate change, so assessing which pathogens are most climate-sensitive, and their characteristics, is vital information if we are to prepare for the future.\" The researchers carried out a systematic review of published literature on one hundred human and one hundred domestic animal pathogens present in Europe that have the largest impact on health. Nearly 2/3 of the pathogens examined were found to be sensitive to climate; and 2/3 of these have more than one climate driver, meaning that the impact of climate change upon them will likely be multifaceted and complex. Diseases spread by insects and ticks (vectorborne diseases) were found to be the most climate sensitive, followed by those transmitted in soil, water and food. The diseases with the largest number of different climate drivers were _Vibrio cholerae_ (cause of cholera), _Fasciola hepatica_ (cause of liver fluke), _Bacillus anthracis_ (cause of anthrax), and _Borrelia burgdorferi_ (cause of tickborne Lyme disease). Dr Marie McIntyre commented: \"Currently, most models examining climate effects only consider a single or at most 2 climate drivers, so our results suggest that this should change if we really want to understand future impacts of climate change on health.\" Zoonotic pathogens  those that spread from animals to humans  were also found to be more climate sensitive than those that affect only humans or only animals. As 75 per cent of emerging diseases are zoonotic, emerging diseases may be particularly likely to be impacted by climate change. However, the researchers stress that their response to climate change will also be dependent on the impacts of other drivers, such as changes to travel and trade, land-use, deforestation, new control measures, and the development of antimicrobial resistance. The top 100 human and animals list was compiled using the Enhanced Infectious Disease Database (EID2),  a comprehensive and open-access 'big data' record of over 60 million scientific papers, electronic sources and textbooks associated with infectious diseases that was developed in Liverpool. As the area of occurrence of some pathogens expands, the patterns of infectious disease might change as a result of pathogens finding new hosts. In addition, a long established host-parasite interaction in a given population may change because environmental change might favor pathogens (increasing pathogen and/or vector proliferation, or pathogen and/or vector survivability) or increase the host's susceptibility to infection. It is important to recognize that climate change does not act alone. There is concomitant action of other human driven impact, such as pollution, habitat fragmentation, land use change, urbanization, and other human pressures that might interact with each other and affect synergistically the health of wildlife populations and the dynamics of their pathogens. - Mod.PMB ", "dates": ["Date: Tue 2 Aug 2017"], "title": "Climate change, disease impact: Europe "}, "650": {"sentences": "OMS | Recursos y planificaci\u00f3n  Ir al contenido principal  Access  Home Alt+0  Navigation Alt+1  Content Alt+2  Buscar  Buscar en WHO.int  Submit  B\u00fasqueda avanzada  Navigation  Acceso  Temas de salud  Datos y estad\u00edsticas  Centro de prensa  Publicaciones  Pa\u00edses  Programas y proyectos  Gobernanza  Acerca de la OMS  Language  \u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a  \u4e2d\u6587  English  Fran\u00e7ais  \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439  Espa\u00f1ol  Acerca de la OMS  Men\u00fa de navegaci\u00f3n  Acerca de la OMS  Nuestras actividades  D\u00f3nde trabajamos  Gobernanza  Alianzas y colaboraciones  Alianzas  Alianzas acogidas  Otros programas, servicios y secretar\u00edas acogidos por la OMS  Documentaci\u00f3n de la OMS sobre alianzas  Planificaci\u00f3n, finanzas y rendici\u00f3n de cuentas  Reformas de la OMS  Programas y establecimiento de prioridades  Reforma de la gobernanza  Reforma de la gesti\u00f3n  Proceso de reforma de la OMS: documentaci\u00f3n  Capacidad ante emergencias  Grupo asesor  Comit\u00e9 de Asesoramiento y Supervisi\u00f3n Presupuesto  El marco de los recursos financieros y los gastos de la OMS se basa en el Duod\u00e9cimo Programa General de Trabajo, que abarca el periodo 2014\u20132019.

The Health Minister, Lucrecia Hernandez, confirmed that the outbreak began in the municipality of Dolores, Peten department. The 1st documented case occurred on 9 Jul 2017 and to date 60 cases have been reported. \"Of these 2 persons died, the 1st on 17 Jul 2017 and the other on 21 Jul 2017,\" said the minister. She explained that the 1st death occurred due to a complication of pancreatitis and the 2nd case was a patient who was transferred from his house to the hospital in Izabal but died on the way. Hernandez explained that the other 58 cases have been taken care of by the health department. \"The epidemiological investigation of case identification, as well as prevention measures are being implemented,\" she said. The minister asked the population, particularly of Dolores, Peten, to consult a health center when presenting with fever and abdominal pain. \"We have seen a reduction in the number of registered cases, but we still cannot say that the outbreak is contained; we hope to do so in the coming weeks,\" said the official. The Ministry of Health indicates that they have done an analysis of the water consumed in the sector but there is still no conclusive report of what caused the outbreak of the disease. \"We suspect this is a problem of food handling. Typhoid fever can be asymptomatic, that is they do not show the disease, but the infected person can still spread it,\" said Hernandez. Because of this health authorities ask the population to reinforce hygiene measures when handling food and chlorinate or boil water. Byline: Carlos Alvarez  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Typhoid fever, so-called enteric fever caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi, has a totally different presentation from that of the commoner kinds of salmonellosis. Epidemiologically, usually spread by contaminated food or water, typhoid is not a zoonosis like the more commonly seen types of salmonellosis. Clinically, vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent; indeed, constipation is frequently reported. As it is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive. The symptoms of classical typhoid fever typically include fever, anorexia, lethargy, malaise, dull continuous headache, non-productive cough, vague abdominal pain, and constipation. Despite the often high fever, the pulse is often only slightly elevated. During the 2nd week of the illness, there is protracted fever and mental dullness, classically called coma vigil. Diarrhea may develop but usually does not. Many patients develop hepatosplenomegaly both liver and spleen enlarged. After the 1st week or so, many cases develop a maculopapular rash on the upper abdomen. These lesions (\"rose spots\") are about 2 cm 0.78 in in diameter and blanch on pressure.

At least 13 cases have been detected in the last 2 months in the block. In Ouguri revenue circle, 11 villages with a population of slightly more than 10 000, has accounted for almost all of them. Acute encephalitis syndrome is a condition of brain inflammation caused by both bacterial and viral infections and possibly toxicants. It is accompanied by fever, headaches, seizures, disorientation and vomiting in people, and if not treated quickly can result in death. The Japanese encephalitis virus JEV has been responsible for most cases of acute encephalitis syndrome in India and South Asia in many instances, JEV infections have comprised a minor part of AES cases. - Mod.TY The outbreak in Jorhat is part of a larger outbreak in the state. As of Mon 31 Jul 2017, 1404 people in Assam have been diagnosed with acute encephalitis syndrome in Assam this year 2017, 424 among them have tested positive for Japanese encephalitis. About 119 people have died of acute encephalitis syndrome of which 58 had Japanese encephalitis virus infections. In fact, out of the 12 people who were detected to be infected by Japanese encephalitis in Bhogamukh, 11 had been vaccinated. And they are not the only ones. Almost 28 per cent of people in the state who have been infected by Japanese encephalitis had been vaccinated, said Dr Parashee Choudhury, senior medical and health officer at the state's Infectious Disease Surveillance Program. \"There is definitely a problem there too. We need more research to say what exactly is wrong.\" Assam is the only state where children in all its districts are being given the Japanese encephalitis vaccine as routine immunisation, which is part of India's universal immunisation program. The state began administering the vaccine to children for the 1st time in 2006 in Sibsagar district, and has since gradually expanded the coverage to other districts. According to state government data, almost 80 per cent of all children under 15 had been vaccinated as of December, 2016. In 2014, Assam also became the 1st state to administer the Japanese encephalitis vaccine to adults. The adult vaccination programme has covered 18 districts as of now, according to state government data reviewed by Scroll.in. However, the exact number of people vaccinated has yet to be compiled. While there is consensus among doctors that the immunisation intervention has been crucial, most acknowledge that there are gaps in the vaccination system. Those who have received vaccinations should not succumb to infections. However, the government's own data over the years confirms that is not the case. Doctors in the region suspect that the cold chain to transport the vaccines to remote areas may have been compromised at some places. \"By the time, the vaccine reaches a remote village in Sibasagar and Jorhat, where there are practically no roads, it is possible that their efficacy decreases because it is difficult to maintain a cold chain for such a long time,\" said a government doctor who did not want to be identified. The doctor added that the vaccine provided immunity only against Japanese encephalitis. She said: \"There are so many other viruses that can be responsible for acute encephalitis syndrome like the West Nile, but more often and then they don't even get detected and we never get to know what actually caused the symptoms.\" However, Assam's extensive vaccination drive, doctors and public health experts contend, has at least brought down the case fatality rate in patients suffering from Japanese encephalitis. The death toll from Japanese encephalitis, data suggests, has come down marginally since 2014. Ouguri, which is part of the Bhogamukh administrative block, has been at the centre of an acute encephalitis syndrome outbreak. At least 13 cases have been detected in the last 2 months in the block. The Ouguri revenue circle, with 11 villages and a population of slightly more than 10 000, has accounted for almost all of them. Acute encephalitis syndrome is a condition of brain inflammation caused by both bacterial and viral infections and possibly toxicants. It is accompanied by fever, headaches, seizures, disorientation and vomiting in people, and if not treated quickly can result in death. The Japanese encephalitis virus has been responsible for most cases of acute encephalitis syndrome in India and South Asia. There is no specific treatment for Japanese encephalitis, but given the high fatality rate, patients require hospitalisation, supportive care and treatment of symptoms by ensuring rest and administering fluids, pain relievers and medication to reduce fever. While immunisation interventions in the encephalitis endemic districts of Dibrugarh, Jorhat and Sibasagar have helped arrest the spread of the virus to a large extent, most doctors and health workers in the region admit there is a long way to go. The adult vaccination program introduced in 2014, in particular, has suffered many setbacks because of widespread rumours that the Japanese encephalitis vaccine led to impotency. \"This is primarily because there is very little faith in the public health system\", said Suneel Kaul, a public health professional who operates out of rural lower Assam. \"In many tribal areas here, teams that come to administer the vaccine were almost lynched. Any immunisation drive has to be preceded by a lot of communication.\" The failure is evident in areas where the outbreak has been severe. For example, the Baghchung administrative block in Jorhat district, has had 20 acute encephalitis syndrome cases, out of which 15 have been Japanese encephalitis. Five people with Japanese encephalitis and one person with acute encephalitis syndrome not caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus have died - all adults who had never been vaccinated. Areas like Sibasagar, Jorhat and Dibrugarh are vulnerable to Japanese encephalitis due to their geography. \"Just look around the area,\" said Baruah. \"There are all these wetlands, plus so many people breed pigs. And then there are egrets everywhere. The whole area is like a heaven for mosquitoes to breed. No vaccination drive can offset all of these factors.\" Pigs and wild water birds like egrets, which abound in upper Assam, are known to act as hosts to the culex mosquito - the vector that transmits the Japanese encephalitis virus to humans. But while, the animals and birds are hosts for the mosquitoes, stagnant water helps them breed. With geographical peculiarities working against the local population, there is very little in terms of a 2nd line of defense when the vaccination fails to immunise people. Assam's health infrastructure in remote areas is almost non-existent. Disease surveillance can help pre-empt outbreaks but the state surveillance system what does it consist of is also not adequate, claim public health professionals. \"The entire surveillance system has been weak for a while now,\" said a person with an international health non-profit organisation that works closely with the Assam government. \"So, irrespective of vaccination programs, cases of JE will keep emerging from time to time.\" Choudhury of the Infectious Disease Surveillance Program countered claims of the encephalitis surveillance program being not sturdy enough, even as she admitted that the programme did not have enough manpower. \"Every district reports each case of JE to the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme office in Guwahati,\" she explained. \"And if there is a new case in any area with no history, our people go there immediately, collect blood samples, and are always on alert.\" Meanwhile, community health workers have alleged that the government has been complacent about mosquito control measures because the outbreak in 2016 was less severe than the preceding years. In both Baghchung and Bhogamukh  the most severely affected areas in Jorhat  the government did not spray mosquito repellents. Such spraying or fogging is important in areas prone to mosquitoborne infections. \"Whatever fogging has happened has happened after people started dying,\" claimed a health worker. \"By then, the damage was already done. There seems to be a shortage of even DDT this year 2017.\" Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane or DDT is still used as to control mosquitoes in many parts of the country. byline: Arunabh Saikia  communicated by: ProMED-mail Although there are many cases of acue encephalitis syndrome (AES) without an etiological diagnosis, clearly there are many cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) occurring in these areas in Assam state. The reason or reasons for the lack of protection from the vaccine is not clear. The type of vaccine, inactivated or live attenuated, is not stated. Certainly, difficulty in maintaining a cold chain could be an important factor, especially for a live vaccine. The duration of an inactivated vaccine is likely to be relatively short, and require annual boosters. The affected areas in Assam have all the conditions favorable fot JE virus transmission: ardeid birds (herons and their relatives) as reservoirs, pigs as amplifying hosts and wetlands suitable for breeding of culex vector mosquitoes. Vector control over wide-spread wetlands is very difficult and expensive. Use of insecticides over long periods of time is likely to result in resistant mosquito populations. - Mod.TY ", "dates": ["Date: Thu 3 Aug 2017 02:30 pm", "a population of slightly more than 10 000 has accounted for almost", "of [Mon 31 Jul 2017] 1404 people in Assam have been diagnosed with", "acute encephalitis syndrome in Assam this year [2017] 424 among them", "administering the vaccine to children for the 1st time in 2006 in", "In 2014 Assam also became the 1st state to administer the Japanese", "than 10 000 has accounted for almost all of them"], "title": "Japanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (AS)\r\n\t"}, "293": {"sentences": "   Wed 19 Jul 2017 Source: GreekReporter edited The 1st case of West Nile virus in Greece in the past 2 years has been reported and confirmed by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KEELPNO).

Mosquitoes of the genus _Culex_ mainly and to a lesser extent _Aedes_ spp. and _Ochlerotatus_ spp. act as vectors, while several bird species act as amplifying hosts. Horses, humans, and other mammals are also enrolled, acting as incidental or dead-end hosts. Infection from WNV has been an important public health issue for many European countries, including Greece, since 2010. WNV circulation has been recorded in several countries across the European continent, both in Central Europe and in the Mediterranean basin Two main WNV genetic lineages have been reported by various research studies. Lineage 1 has been found in Europe, Africa, Middle East, America, Australia, and India, whereas lineage 2 has been initially recorded in sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar. ( ). Several studies have demonstrated a strong correlation between environmental factors and the incidence of WNV. The quantification of the virus circulation in mosquitoes can likely provide evidence for the identification of \"at risk\" areas for human transmission. - Mod. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ ", "dates": ["Date: Wed 19 Jul 2017"], "title": "West Nile virus - Europe: Greece (PW) "}, "155": {"sentences": " Magill Partners GeoSentinel Global TravEpiNet Mobile Apps RSS Feeds  Zika Virus in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  Recommend on Facebook  Tweet  Share Compartir  Warning - Level 3, Avoid Nonessential Travel  Alert - Level 2, Practice Enhanced Precautions  Watch - Level 1, Practice Usual Precautions  Language:  Select  Espa&ntilde;ol  What is the current situation?  Zika virus (or Zika) has been reported in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines are infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:  Women who are pregnant:  Do not travel to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines or any other area with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers who have a pregnant partner:  Use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.  Travelers considering pregnancy:  Before you or your partner travel, talk to your health care provider about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection.  Wait before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.  If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex &ndash; or do not have sex &ndash; for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More Zika information for pregnant women  2.

Travelers considering pregnancy  Talk to your health care provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you&rsquo;re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Wait at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.

However, locals and doctors claim over 2000 people have been affected by the virus in Tharparkar. The chief executive officer of the Health and Nutrition Development Society (HANDS) expressed concern over the virus outbreak and attributed the deaths to poor treatment or self-medication. Hundreds of patients were rushed to the ill-equipped Chhachhro taluka hospital for treatment. The hospital, housing only 20 beds and 3 wards, cannot accept any more patients. The affected are now being transported to hospitals in Umerkot and Mithi. According to the DHO's statement, most affected villages include Ram Sighani, Udani and Fangario, among others, where medical camps are being set up to treat patients. Although Dr Memon claimed that measures are being taken to prevent the virus from spreading any further, those affected and their families deny that authorities have provided them any health facilities in Chhachhro and other towns. The DHO said that the increase in the cases of the virus was due to heavy rainfall in the arid region, adding that the situation was \"under control\", and that various villages have already been fumigated twice to get rid of the virus-carrying mosquitoes. Dr Memon said that Field Emergency Laboratory Testing Programme, in collaboration with the Centre for Disease Control conducted medical tests of patients complaining of severe joint pain  one of the main symptoms of chikungunya virus.

The overall case-fatality rate of 0.5 percent remains below the emergency threshold of 1 percent. However it is higher in Raymah (1.2 percent), Ibb (0.8 percent) and Hajjah (0.8 percent). The number of suspected cholera cases and deaths has declined compared to previous weeks, although there is a backlog of case information currently under review, and these numbers could change. WHO and health partners support the Ministry through the cholera task force to improve cholera response efforts at the national and local levels. This includes the establishment of 47 diarrhoea treatment facilities and 278 oral dehydration centres in 16 governorates; training of health workers to manage cases, water purification in communities, deployment of rapid response team to manage cholera cases investigations and respond to the outbreak, and enhancement of Yemen's disease early warning surveillance systems. Since Thu 27 Apr 2017, WHO has provided more than 788 000 bags of intravenous fluids, 525 beds with cleaning supplies and 112 kits containing supplies for the treatment of cholera and diarrhoeal diseases. A reactive cholera vaccination campaign using one million single doses of vaccine has been postponed at the request of health authorities in favour of a 2-dose preventative vaccination campaign next year 2018 targeting more people in the highest risk districts, based on the availability of the vaccine in the global stockpile. While cholera is endemic in Yemen, the country has experienced a surge in cholera cases since April 2017, with nearly 5000 cases reported per day.

Wait before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.  Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women  Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other health care provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.  If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex &ndash; or do not have sex &ndash; for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex, or do not have sex, for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.  &gt;&gt; More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy  Talk to your health care provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you&rsquo;re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Wait at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you&rsquo;re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Wait at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  Men are advised to wait longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.gov  Contact CDC  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  1600 Clifton Road  Atlanta ,  GA  30329-4027  USA  800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)  Contact CDC-INFO  TOP", "dates": [" Page created: January 22 2016", " Page last updated: August 08 2017", " Page last reviewed: August 08 2017", " 30329-4027", " 800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)"], "title": ["Zika Virus in Ecuador"]}, "257": {"sentences": "   Mon 17 July 2017 Source: Outbreak News Today edited Health officials in the west African country of Mali confirmed a single case of Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus infection in a 10-year-old boy from Oulessebougou. This case was identified through laboratory investigations into 3 suspected yellow fever cases. All 3 samples tested negative for all arboviruses included on the molecular panel, namely: dengue, West Nile, RVF, chikungunya, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and Ebola. However, one sample was anti-RVF virus IgM positive on serology testing by ELISA. Earlier this month July 2017, the district rapid response team was deployed to the affected village to conduct outbreak investigation. The team observed that the affected village is served by a large diameter well, with shepherds in seasonal movement with their livestock living nearby and regularly visiting the village. Score of samples were taken from villagers and domestic animals. Test results are pending. The World Health Organization says the occurrence of a sporadic case of RVF in a village in Mali is not surprising. During August-November 2016, communities in the Tahoua Region, Niger (on the border with Mali) experienced an outbreak of RVF. And in January this year 2017, OIE confirmed RVF virus as the cause of abortions in sheep and goats across the border in Menaka, Mali (some 1700 km 1056 mi from the abovementioned outbreaks). Nevertheless, the detection of even a single case warrants an immediate emergency response, as such cases are often an early indication of widespread infection in livestock populations, associated with abortions with devastating economic impacts. Though the disease in humans is often subclinical or mild, 8 to 10 percent of cases develop severe symptoms, including ocular disease, encephalitis and/or haemorrhagic fever.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Cases occur sporadically in livestock and in humans. Mod.AS provided an excellent comment on RVF previously; \"Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a peracute or acute zoonotic disease of domestic ruminants. It is caused by a single serotype of a mosquito-borne virus of the _Bunyaviridae_ family (genus _Phlebovirus_). The disease occurs in climatic conditions favouring the breeding of mosquito vectors and is characterised in some domestic animals by abortion, neonatal mortality, and liver damage. The disease is most severe in sheep, goats and cattle. Older, non-pregnant animals, although susceptible to infection, are more resistant to clinical disease. There is considerable variation in the susceptibility to RVF of animals of different species. Camels usually have an inapparent infection with RVF virus (RVFV), but sudden mortality, neonatal mortality, and abortion occur, and abortion rates can be as high as in cattle. \"Humans are susceptible to RVFV and are infected through contact with infected animal material (body fluids or tissues) or through bites from infected mosquitoes. RVFV has also caused serious infections in laboratory workers and must be handled with biosafety and biocontainment measures. It is recommended that laboratory workers be vaccinated if possible. \"RVFV is endemic in many African countries and may involve several countries in the region at the same time or progressively expand geographically over the course of a few years. In addition to Africa, large outbreaks have been observed in the Arabian Peninsula and some Indian Ocean Islands. These generally, but not exclusively, follow the periodic cycles of unusually heavy rainfall, which may occur at intervals of several years, or the flooding of wide areas favouring the proliferation of mosquitoes. \"Rainfall facilitates mosquito eggs to hatch. _Aedes_ mosquitoes acquire the virus from feeding on infected animals and may potentially vertically transmit the virus transovarily so that new generations of infected mosquitoes may hatch from their eggs. This provides a potential mechanism for maintaining the virus in nature, as the eggs of these mosquitoes may survive for periods of up to several years in dry conditions. Once livestock is infected, a wide variety of mosquito species may act as the vector for transmission of RVFV and can spread the disease. \"Low level RVF activity may take place during inter-epizootic periods. RVF should be suspected when exceptional flooding and subsequent abundant mosquito populations are followed by the occurrence of abortions, together with fatal disease marked by necrosis and haemorrhages in the liver that particularly affect newborn lambs, kids and calves, potentially concurrent with the occurrence of an influenza-like illness in farm workers and people handling raw meat. \"During an outbreak, preventive measures to protect workers from infection should be employed when there are suspicions that RVFV-infected animals or animal products are to be handled. \"The above and much more information is available at  .\" Although ProMED-mail has received relatively few reports of RVF in Mali, there have been cases reported this year (2017) in neighboring Mauritania and Niger. Oulessebougou is located 80 km (50 mi) south of Bamako in southwestern Mali. - Mod.TY ", "dates": ["Date: Mon 17 July 2017", "1700 km [1056 mi] from the abovementioned outbreaks)"], "title": "Rift Valley fever - Mali (02): (KK) "}, "112": {"sentences": " Magill Partners GeoSentinel Global TravEpiNet Mobile Apps RSS Feeds  Polio in Democratic Republic of the Congo  Recommend on Facebook  Tweet  Share Compartir  Warning - Level 3, Avoid Nonessential Travel  Alert - Level 2, Practice Enhanced Precautions  Watch - Level 1, Practice Usual Precautions  What is the current situation?  Cases of vaccine-derived polio have been reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, according to the World Health Organization. The cases occurred in Haut-Lomami Province and in Maniema Province.  Vaccine-derived polio can occur in places with low vaccination rates and poor sanitation where oral polio vaccine containing a weakened version of the virus is used. In such circumstances, this weakened virus can circulate for an extended period of time and change into a form that can cause paralysis.  CDC recommends that all travelers to the Democratic Republic of the Congo be fully vaccinated against polio. In addition, adults who have been fully vaccinated should receive a single lifetime booster dose of polio vaccine.  What is polio?  Polio is a disease caused by a virus that affects the nervous system. It is spread by person-to-person contact, mainly through exposure to the feces of an infected person. You could also get polio by drinking water or other drinks or eating raw or undercooked food that has been contaminated by the feces of an infected person.  Most people with polio do not feel sick. Some people have only minor symptoms, such as fever, tiredness, nausea, headache, nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, stiffness in the neck and back, and pain in the arms and legs. Most people recover completely. In rare cases, polio infection causes permanent loss of muscle function in the arms or legs (usually the legs); if there is loss of function of the muscles used for breathing or an infection of the brain, death can occur.  What can travelers do to prevent polio?  Get the polio vaccine:  Ask your doctor or nurse to find out if you are up to date with your polio vaccination and whether you need a booster dose before traveling. Even if you were vaccinated as a child or have been sick with polio before, you may need a booster dose to make sure that you are protected. See individual destination pages for vaccine recommendation information.  Make sure children are vaccinated.  See the Polio Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) for more information.  Eat foods and drink beverages that are considered safe: Follow the Food and Water Safety tips to avoid eating or drinking things that could be contaminated with polio virus.  Practice hygiene and cleanliness:  Wash your hands often.  If soap and water aren&rsquo;t available, clean your hands with hand sanitizer (containing at least 60% alcohol).  Don&rsquo;t touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. If you need to touch your face, make sure your hands are clean.  Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.  Try to avoid close contact, such as kissing, hugging, or sharing eating utensils or cups, with people who are sick.  Traveler Information  CDC Polio Homepage  Polio Vaccine Information Statement (VIS)  Food and Water Safety  Clinician Information  All travelers to any country should be up to date on routine vaccinations, including polio vaccine. CDC recommends a single lifetime IPV booster dose for travelers to certain countries.

The 1st confirmed case died on 8 Jun 2017, and the 2nd victim is currently hospitalized. \"It wasn't surprising but we want to investigate what's going on and see if it's a coincidence that these cases occurred in the same county or if there's something else larger going on,\" Melissa Prusinski, Research Scientist at the Wadsworth Center, said. The DOH collected 200 ticks in Saratoga County this year 2017 at 5 sites and did not find any positive for Powassan virus. Health officials say it's rare compared to Lyme disease but without being able to sample a larger population it's hard to know the true statistic. \"Dragging only samples about one percent of the population at any given time so 99 percent of the ticks are elsewhere,\" Prusinski said. There are a number of important things you can do to protect yourself from ticks. \"What people may want to do is ramp up the amount of times that they check themselves,\" Bryon Backenson, Epidemiologist at NYS DOH, said. Another thing that can help if you're going to be out in nature is to wear very light colored clothing and tuck your pants into your socks. You can also wear 30 percent DEET repellent, which lasts 4 to 8 hours and be aware of some symptoms for Powassan virus. \"Kind of the earlier signs of that is a horrible headache. It's a headache that won't go away,\" Backenson said. The department says the cases of Powassan occurred in 3 different towns in Saratoga County. \"To try and figure out if there a higher infection rate or has the infection rate moved from zero to something else that maybe we haven't picked up yet.\" Byline: Lindsay Nielsen  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. This is another new case of Powassan virus infection in the Upper Hudson Valley in New York state. Although cases in New York are not common, they do occur sporadically. As noted in the previous post (archive http://promedmail.org/post/20170714.5173571), in 2013, there were several cases of encephalitis caused by Powassan virus (POWV) infection in New York's lower Hudson Valley, and especially in Putnam County (see ProMED-mail posts listed below). A follow up study provided a good description of the tick virus vector and POWV relationship in the 2007-2012 period, and the prevalence of POWV in ticks during that time span (see Tick-borne encephalitis virus - USA: (NY) Powassan virus http://promedmail.org/post/20140823.2716624). There is no reason to think that the prevalence and geographic distribution of ticks and virus is restricted in New York state to the lower Hudson River Valley. Saratoga county is located in the upper Hudson River Valley. - Mod. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ ", "dates": ["Date: Tue 18 Jul 2018 8:54 AM EDT", "been found in residents in Saratoga County on [Tue 18 Jul 2017]", "[The 1st confirmed case died on 8 Jun [2017] and] the 2nd victim is", "The DOH collected 200 ticks in Saratoga County this year [2017] at 5", "org/post/20170714", "5173571) in 2013 there", "relationship in the 2007-2012 period and the prevalence of POWV in", "org/post/20140823", "2716624)"], "title": "Powassan virus encephalitis - USA (07): USA (NY)\r\n\t"}, "637": {"sentences": "OMS | Declaraciones  Ir al contenido principal  Access  Home Alt+0  Navigation Alt+1  Content Alt+2  Buscar  Buscar en WHO.int  Submit  B\u00fasqueda avanzada  Navigation  Acceso  Temas de salud  Datos y estad\u00edsticas  Centro de prensa  Publicaciones  Pa\u00edses  Programas y proyectos  Gobernanza  Acerca de la OMS  Language  \u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a  \u4e2d\u6587  English  Fran\u00e7ais  \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439  Espa\u00f1ol  Centro de prensa  Men\u00fa de navegaci\u00f3n  Centro de prensa  Noticias  Comunicados de prensa  Archivos  Declaraciones  Archivos  Notas para los medios de informaci\u00f3n  Archivos  Eventos  Eventos oficiales  Reuniones, consultas  Notas descriptivas  Reportajes  Comentarios  Multimedia  Contactos  Declaraciones  2017  Declaraci\u00f3n conjunta de las Naciones Unidas para poner fin a la discriminaci\u00f3n en los centros de atenci\u00f3n de la salud 27 de junio de 2017  Declaraci\u00f3n conjunta del UNICEF y la OMS sobre el brote de c\u00f3lera en el Yemen 24 de junio de 2017  Declaraci\u00f3n de la Directora General de la OMS tras el fallecimiento del Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin 5 de junio de 2017  Declaraci\u00f3n sobre el ebola en la Rep\u00fablica Democr\u00e1tica del Congo 12 de mayo de 2017  Declaraci\u00f3n de la Directora General de la OMS sobre la crisis humanitaria en el Yemen 25 de abril de 2017  La OMS declara sentirse alarmada por el uso de armas qu\u00edmicas altamente t\u00f3xicas en Siria 5 de abril de 2017  12.\u00aa reuni\u00f3n del Comit\u00e9 de Emergencias del Reglamento Sanitario Internacional (2015) acerca de la propagaci\u00f3n internacional de poliovirus 13 de febrero de 2017  Los organismos de Naciones Unidas piden el acceso inmediato en Siria 16 de enero de 2017  Otras declaraciones  Director General  Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General de la OMS  Asamblea Mundial de la Salud  70.\u00aa Asamblea Mundial de la Salud Delegaciones de los 194 Estados Miembros de la OMS se reunieron en Ginebra del 22 al 31 de mayo de 2017  Enfermedad por el virus de Zika  ika\" width=\"310\" height=\"50\" />  Sitio de la OMS sobre el virus de Zika Noticias, reportajes, documentaci\u00f3n t\u00e9cnica  Reportajes  Acci\u00f3n Sanitaria de los Estados Miembros de la OMS  Servicios  RSS  Twitter  You are here:  Centro de prensa  Declaraciones  Quick Links  Mapa del sitio  Acceso  Temas de salud  Datos y estad\u00edsticas  Centro de prensa  Publicaciones  Pa&iacute;ses  Programas y proyectos  Gobernanza  Acerca de la  OMS  Ayuda y servicios  Contactos  Preguntas frecuentes  Empleo  Sugerencias  Privacidad  Mensajes fraudulentos  Oficinas regionales de la OMS  Regi&oacute;n de \u00c1frica  Regi&oacute;n de las Am\u00e9ricas  Regi&oacute;n de Asia Sudoriental  Regi&oacute;n de Europa  Regi&oacute;n del Mediterr\u00e1neo Oriental  Regi&oacute;n del Pac&iacute;fico Occidental  &#169;  OMS 2017  Arriba", "dates": [" Declaraci\u00f3n conjunta de las Naciones Unidas para poner fin a la discriminaci\u00f3n en los centros de atenci\u00f3n de la salud 27 de junio de 2017", " Declaraci\u00f3n conjunta del UNICEF y la OMS sobre el brote de c\u00f3lera en el Yemen 24 de junio de 2017", " Babatunde Osotimehin 5 de junio de 2017", " Declaraci\u00f3n sobre el ebola en la Rep\u00fablica Democr\u00e1tica del Congo 12 de mayo de 2017", " Declaraci\u00f3n de la Directora General de la OMS sobre la crisis humanitaria en el Yemen 25 de abril de 2017", " La OMS declara sentirse alarmada por el uso de armas qu\u00edmicas altamente t\u00f3xicas en Siria 5 de abril de 2017", "\u00aa reuni\u00f3n del Comit\u00e9 de Emergencias del Reglamento Sanitario Internacional (2015) acerca de la propagaci\u00f3n internacional de poliovirus 13 de febrero de 2017", " Los organismos de Naciones Unidas piden el acceso inmediato en Siria 16 de enero de 2017", "\u00aa Asamblea Mundial de la Salud Delegaciones de los 194 Estados Miembros de la OMS se reunieron en Ginebra del 22 al 31 de mayo de 2017", " ika\" width=\"310\" height=\"50\" />"], "title": ["Declaraciones"]}, "748": {"sentences": "   Tue 29 Aug 2017 From: a subscriber whose identity is known to ProMED, but who preferred to remain unnamed edited In response to ProMED-mail's RFI's in postings http://promedmail.org/post/20170815.5251541 and http://promedmail.org/post/20170825.5274779 about lumpy skin disease in Kazakhstan: 1. It is understood that the government of Kazakhstan officially announced the presence, in 2017, of nodular dermatitis aka lumpy skin disease, LSD. 2. Russian and Kenyan LSD vaccines have been mentioned as the ones applied, and their effectiveness discussed. 3. Private owners of livestock suffer most, because the compensation for each sick cow is minimal. It is necessary to develop an effective compensation scheme for the smallholder livestock owners. 4. The following information on the 2016 LSD event in Kazakhstan was included in a report for the population, by the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic of Kazakhstan, AI Myrzahmetov, published on 2 Jun 2017: \"In 2016, 4 foci of nodular dermatitis outbreaks in cattle were reported in the Atyrau oblast. Amendments were made to the legislation and 185 million tenge (USD 551 300) were paid from the republican budget as compensation for the cost of animals that died from this disease. To date, all liquidation measures have been completed. Preventive vaccination of livestock in Atyrau oblast, as well as in 6 border areas of Aktobe Aqtobe (2) and West Kazakhstan (4) oblasts, are coming to an end.\"  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. ProMED-mail is very grateful to the submitter of the information above, addressing 4 issues raised in earlier postings on LSD in Kazakhstan. The following comments address the issues as numbered above: 1. Additional details (link?) of the mentioned official confirmation, by Kazakhstan's authorities, of the current (2017) LSD event will be helpful. The internationally customary (in fact, required) route for such an announcement is an immediate notification to the OIE. 2. The LSD vaccine applied in Russia (and exported) is, in fact, a sheep-pox vaccine which, following a testing procedure, was recently licensed also for the vaccination of cattle against LSD (see http://promedmail.org/post/20170511.5028821). The Kenyan O-240 vaccine has been recently found to include an LSD virus which underwent a low level of attenuation which may be not sufficient for safe use in cattle. It was suspected to cause clinical disease in vaccinated animals (see in http://promedmail.org/post/20140820.2708273). EU countries currently use a live-homologous LSD vaccine (South-Africa's Neetling virus strain). A European Union LSD vaccine bank has become operational since April 2016. Trials assessing an inactivated vaccine were reportedly undertaken, currently in their final stages. For a recent assessment of LSD vaccines, please see http://promedmail.org/post/20160812.4410864, including the commentary. OIE's Manual chapter on LSD, including exhaustive updated information, is available at  . 3. This comment is of high significance. Small-holders, worldwide, may be slow, or even tempted to refrain altogether from reporting the appearance of early signs of a reportable animal disease, if they expect compensations to be under the real damages and payments delayed. Such animals may be (illegally) sold, with consequent spread of disease and  eventually  higher national losses and expenditures. 4. The original text, in Kazakh and Russian, is available in Kazakhstan's Ministry of Agriculture blog, at  . In case the recent media reports on LSD spreading in Western Kazakhstan are confirmed, it will be of interest to note if the affected farms included vaccinated animals and which vaccines were used. Kazakhstan's official reporting on the 2016 LSD event was limited to a solitary notification on a single outbreak; no details of the vaccination (numbers and vaccinated animals, geography) were included. According to the recent official update, LSD was recorded, during 2016, in 4 locations within the Atyrau oblast. Timely and detailed information on the LSD situation in Kazakhstan is essential for the entire region. This applies also for another livestock disease suspected to be spreading in central Asia, namely PPR (peste des petits ruminants) in small ruminants. - Mod. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ ", "dates": ["Date: Tue 29 Aug 2017", "org/post/20170815", "5251541 and", "org/post/20170825", "5274779 about lumpy skin disease", "on [2 Jun 2017]:", "\"In 2016 4 foci of nodular dermatitis outbreaks in cattle were", "and 185 million tenge (USD 551 300) were paid from the republican", "org/post/20170511", "5028821)", "org/post/20140820", "2708273)", "org/post/20160812", "4410864 including the commentary", "2016 in 4 locations within the Atyrau oblast"], "title": "Lumpy skin disease,\r\n\tbovine - Kazakhstan (03): (AR) spread susp, \r\n\tvaccination, RFI "}, "622": {"sentences": "OMS | Los campos electromagn\u00e9ticos  Ir al contenido principal  Access  Home Alt+0  Navigation Alt+1  Content Alt+2  Buscar  Buscar en WHO.int  Submit  B\u00fasqueda avanzada  Navigation  Acceso  Temas de salud  Datos y estad\u00edsticas  Centro de prensa  Publicaciones  Pa\u00edses  Programas y proyectos  Gobernanza  Acerca de la OMS  Language  \u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a  \u4e2d\u6587  English  Fran\u00e7ais  \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439  Espa\u00f1ol  Campos electromagn\u00e9ticos (CEM)  Men\u00fa de navegaci\u00f3n  Acceso CEM  Informaci\u00f3n sobre campos electromagn\u00e9ticos  Proyecto Internacional CEM  Investigaci\u00f3n  Normas y directrices  Publicaciones  Los campos electromagn\u00e9ticos  Los campos electromagn\u00e9ticos (CEM) de todas las frecuencias constituyen una de las influencias del entorno m\u00e1s comunes y de crecimiento m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido sobre las que existe una creciente ansiedad y especulaci\u00f3n.

Early on, labs in the network narrowed the search to members of the paramyxovirus and coronavirus families. Findings shared by network labs earlier this week began pointing, with increasing consistency, to coronaviruses.  \u201cData from many network laboratories indicate that a coronavirus is the primary cause of the disease,\u201d said WHO virologist and epidemiologist Klaus St\u00f6hr. \u201cThis virus is unlike any known human or animal member of this virus family. It is consistently found in specimens from SARS patients from many countries. It has been isolated in cell-culture. We are very close to knowing for sure.\u201d  Conclusive identification of a causative must meet all criteria in the so-called \u201cKoch\u2019s postulate.\u201d The additional experiments needed to fulfil these criteria are currently under way at a laboratory in the Netherlands.  Scientists at Hong Kong University had previously announced, on 21 March, the isolation of a new virus that was strongly suspected to be the causative agent of SARS. The virus was detected in cell culture and by electron microscopy. The identity of the virus was not known at the time.  Earlier this week, researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) produced strong evidence implicating a coronavirus as the agent that causes SARS. Many labs of the WHO network have since been using molecular tests provided by CDC to confirm the presence of a coronavirus in specimens from patients in various countries.  Rapid progress was also facilitated by the sharing of samples, taken from SARS patients in areas with large numbers of confirmed cases, among participants in the laboratory.  Hong Kong, with 367 patients, many of whom are in intensive care, and 10 deaths remains the most severely affected area.  Sequencing of the virus is ongoing in four laboratories. Results will help classify the virus and refine molecular diagnostic tools. Results will also guide the development of specific interventions.  At present, no treatment beyond good intensive and supportive care has been consistently shown to improve prognosis in persons with SARS.  Scientists in the network suspect that the virus will prove to be an entirely new, or until now undetected, member of the coronavirus family.  Progress in the development of a diagnostic test Efforts to develop a reliable and easy to use diagnostic test are also moving forward quickly. Hong Kong University, Chinese University, and Public Virus Labs, all located in Hong Kong and all members of the WHO network, have devised a basic diagnostic test. In studies using confirmed SARS patients and healthy controls, results to date have been consistently positive in confirmed cases and consistently negative in the healthy controls. Further testing will begin tomorrow.  The Hong Kong diagnostic test is a molecular test based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology. Hong Kong scientists have also developed a diagnostic tool using the immunofluorescence assay (IFA) technique. Validation of the test is being facilitated by gene sequences of the PCR primers electronically by laboratories collaborating in the network. The WHO network is offering to make these test materials immediately available to labs in other countries throughout the world  Over the next few days, samples from hundreds of confirmed and suspected SARS cases will be tested using these new diagnostic tools. In so doing, the tools will be further refined and streamlined to upgrade their capacity for daily screening of large numbers of samples.  The PCR test is already showing good reliability in detecting SARS cases in the early days of infection. The IFA test is being used to detect infection in convalescent sera at about three weeks after infection begins. Together, the two tests should help to quickly and safely reassure the many patients the world over who are concerned about suspicious symptoms and yet may be suffering from common illnesses safely treated at home.  Procedures of isolation and strict barrier nursing, recommended by WHO for the management of suspected SARS cases, have placed a heavy burden on health care services in several affected areas.  Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 1408 cases and 53 deaths have been reported from 13 countries. Romania is reporting its first 3 probable cases today. This represents an increase of 85 cases and 4 deaths compared with the previous day.  New data from China The Chinese Ministry of Health has today officially reported 792 cases and 31 deaths, up to 28 February, in Guangdong Province. Approximately 30% of these cases occurred in health workers.  The Chinese Ministry of Health has further reported on SARS cases in other parts of China. In Beijing, 10 cases and 3 deaths have occurred as of 26 March. Two of these cases are in health workers. In the northern province of Shanxi, four cases, with no deaths, have occurred as of 26 March. Two cases are in health workers.

This has been confirmed by Fiocruz Amazonia in an investigation carried out together with state Health Surveillance. The sampling corresponds to the 2011-2016 period. In total, there were 306 individuals investigated, and there were 9 positives among them. The investigation gave negative results for dengue, chikungunya fever, and Zika viruses. These were tested because Oropouche fever presents with symptoms similar to those diseases transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_. The disease Oropouche fever virus is caused transmitted by a mosquito (_Culicoides paraensis_) known colloquially as maruim no-see-ums. The Amazonia Fiocruz Vice-Director of Research and Innovation, Felipe Naveca, explained that in case of an epidemic like the one the country underwent with Zika, the evaluation is usually clinical, which makes it difficult to identify other possible etiologies. In coming days, teams of technicians from the Amazonas and Roraima central laboratories will participate in a training course to use the method for detection of Oropouche developed by Fiocruz Amazonia. The expectation is that the project will be extended to other states in the country. Byline: Michelle Moreira  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-PORT The questions are: Is the virus emerging? Is the capacity/interest in laboratory case research growing? In any case, if it has not already been, this arbovirus has a great potential to appear as one more challenge in the field of public health in Brazil. - Mod.RNA Sporadic cases of Oropouche fever or outbreaks can be expected in areas in Brazil where the culicoid vector is present. As the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has noted: \"The Oropouche virus exists in nature in 2 cycles, the wild and urban-epidemic cycles. In the wild cycle, wildlife such as primates, sloths, and certain arthropods serve as reservoirs, with the culicoid midge, _Culicoides paraensis_ flies acting as vectors. In the urban epidemic cycle, the infection cycle remains vector-human-vector, with humans acting as the principal hosts.\" Oropouche virus is a bunyavirus of the Simbu group. No vaccine is available, so avoidance of bites by the vector midge is the best preventive measure. - Mod.TY   .

The study was repeated last year 2016 by the same team by comparing children with AES and healthy children who are siblings of the patients or living in the same village. It found that AES patients had 35 times greater possibility of having antibodies against scrub typhus compared with healthy children thereby confirming that AES was caused by scrub typhus. Excerpts from an interview with Dr Manoj Murhekar: - Have you carried out any studies this year 2017 on children admitted to BRD hospital with AES? How likely is scrub typhus to have caused AES this year as well? The causation of the disease or etiology will not change from year to year. In 2015 and 2016 we have seen that scrub typhus was responsible for over 60 percent of AES and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) causes less than 10 percent of AES in children below 15 years. Scrub typhus was responsible for over 60 percent of AES even in 2014. There is vaccination for JE virus but no intervention has been implemented widely for scrub typhus. So the etiology wouldn't have changed compared with last year. - Besides BRD hospital, is there any other referral hospital in that region? What is the extent of population that BRD hospital caters to? Except BRD hospital, there is no referral hospital in the Gorakhpur Division in Uttar Pradesh. The hospital caters to people living in Gorakhpur Division (4 districts) and Basti division in UP, Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, and even Nepal. - Why do we see a large number of children with AES each year at BRD hospital? There is a lot of scrub typhus fever in the community. Between 20-25 percent of fever in children being attended to at PHCs primary health centres is caused by scrub typhus. Only a small percentage of these children progress to AES. Most of the cases in the community are sub-clinical with no symptoms or very mild fever. Only some children with fever will progress to AES. The hospital sees 1500-2000 cases each year and 80 percent of these cases are during July to October. About 1/4 of patients with AES are adults. Generally, adults develop immunity against scrub typhus, so only those who have not been exposed to scrub typhus will progress to AES. - Is there any specific reason why scrub typhus is found only in this region? It is not correct to say it is restricted only to this region. Scrub typhus is found even in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu. In Tamil Nadu it is found in Vellore and Thiruvallur districts. About 7-10 percent of fever in these 2 districts is caused by scrub typhus. The reason why it is found only in these 2 districts in Tamil Nadu is because researchers have investigated for scrub typhus in these 2 districts. - Is it possible to treat scrub typhus and prevent the infection from progressing to AES? In the beginning of this year 2017, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) recommended to the Uttar Pradesh government to use doxycycline antibiotic to treat children with fever for 5 days. The ICMR shared an algorithm with the Uttar Pradesh government which tells which fever should be treated with doxycycline and the dosage. If treated early with doxycycline, then children will not progress to AES. This prevention strategy has to be implemented widely and even by doctors in the private sector before we see results. In July 2017, ICMR and doctors from the Christian Medical College, Vellore went to Gorakhpur and conducted awareness campaign for Indian Medical Association (IMA) and Indian Association of Paediatrics (IAP) doctors, chief medical officers, and programme officers. - Why is the death rate high at 20 percent in children with AES? At BRD hospital, we have observed patients with AES. The mortality is about 20 percent due to multi-organ involvement. In the case of AES caused by scrub typhus, the mortality is about 15-17 percent compared with AES caused by JE. This is because treatment started early with azithromycin can treat AES caused by scrub typhus. Azithromycin is in the class of medicines as doxycycline but easy to administer in sick children as it is given intravenously. - What is vaccine coverage for Japanese encephalitis and why don't we see herd immunity with this vaccine? In 2012, the vaccine coverage for Japanese encephalitis was only 50 percent but has improved to 75 percent now. A study we carried out in 2015 found 75 percent coverage for the 1st dose and only 42 percent for the 2nd dose. 3 of the 4 children aged 25-36 months in Gorakhpur region had received at least one dose of the vaccine. We need 2 doses of the vaccine  during 9-12 months for the 1st dose and 16-24 months for the 2nd dose  for optimal protection. With just one dose, the efficacy is over 80 percent. No studies have been done to find the duration of protection. With increasing vaccine coverage the incidence of JE has dropped from about 20 percent a few years ago to less than 10 percent now. In the case of mosquito-borne diseases, herd immunity will not play a major role. So increasing the vaccine coverage should be a priority. Byline: R Prasad  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail As with cases of encephalitis in Uttar Pradesh and other states in northeastern India, as noted in the report above, not all encephalitis cases are due to JE virus infections and are classified as AES with undetermined etiology. AES is a term used for multiple etiologies or often when no etiology has been determined. The report above implicates scrub typhus as a major cause of AES. It is not clear why most of the AES cases are in children, but scrub typhus infections occur in people of all ages. Scrub typhus in India has been receiving additional attention in recent years. a 2013 review article indicated that scrub typhus is seriously neglected and under-reported ( ). ProMED-mail has posted multiple reports of scrub typhus in several Indian states in the past, especially since 2011. For background information, see ProMED-mail post Scrub typhus - India (05): background http://promedmail.org/post/20111208.3546. The report above indicates that JE vaccination campaigns have been active there this year (2017) but have not provided complete coverage. Other etiologies for AES, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_), lychee fruit consumption, and agricultural-related toxicants have been proposed. The above report is another implicating scrub typhus as an important etiology of the AES cases. However, getting to an accurate diagnosis in these cases of AES will require active field surveillance with epidemiological studies supported by timely laboratory testing. Prospective studies are required to confirm the degree of scrub typhus involvement in AES cases. - Mod.TY A recent report in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases (1), which ProMED-mail posted (2), indicated that the scrub typhus may account for a significant proportion of acute encephalitis syndrome in the northeastern Indian state of Assam. ProMED-mail has posted multiple reports of scrub typhus in several Indian states, especially since 2011 (3), so that it is not surprising that scrub typhus could account for many cases of acute encephalitis in other Indian states (4). However, I noted at the time in the moderator comments (2) that although headache is a common part of the symptom complex of scrub typhus, acute encephalitis or meningoencephalitis, with a history of altered sensorium, seizures or neck stiffness, and abnormal neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid findings, complicates a minority of scrub typhus cases (5-7).

This outbreak was part of a wider epidemic in Italy that started in January 2017 and has, as at Sun 30 Jul 2017, led to 4001 cases nationwide (275 in HCW) 2.<br><br><strong> Outbreak description </strong><br> A HCW was referred to the emergency department (ED) of an Italian hospital for a rash developed after taking antibacterials for a mild cough and coryza. The rash was considered an allergic reaction to the antibacterial and the HCW was admitted to the hospital inpatient clinic. Three days later, the HCW's child was admitted to hospital for a rash diagnosed as due to a non-communicable systemic disease. Subsequent serology showed that both the HCW and the child had measles. The origin of the infection for the index case is still unknown. It should be noted, however, that at least 10 community cases of measles occurred in the same period in the area of residence of the HCW. Using the standard case definition of the European Commission 3, a total of 34 measles cases during the following weeks were identified by tracing the contacts of the index case. Among them, 15 were HCWs, 5 were support personnel, 4 were hospital visitors and 11 were community contacts of the above cases. The secondary cases to the index (n\u202f=\u202f8) occurred in 2 of the HCW's relatives, in 4 other HCWs, and in 2 support workers who were not immediately recognized as belonging to the hospital outbreak. One of the secondary cases, a HCW, was in service until the onset of symptoms, accessing all rooms on 2 inpatient wards. Tertiary cases (n\u202f=\u202f6) involved the family of this HCW, 3 HCWs and a member of support personnel. A total of 2 weeks after the admission of the index case, 2 of the HCWs belonging to tertiary cases presented during the night to the ED where they stayed for nearly 10 hours. An additional 15 cases could be traced following this single exposure window, namely 7 HCWs, 2 support workers, 3 relatives of theirs and 3 visitors to the ED during the time the 2 HCWs were present. One more community case was related to contact outside hospital with one of the tertiary HCW cases. Additional cases were related to a visitor at one of the involved inpatient wards, who probably got in contact with one of the tertiary cases who were HCW during the incubation period and generated 3 cases in the community, among them a family pediatrician. Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the epidemic curve and the outbreak tree for figures, see original URL - Mod.LL.<br><br><strong> Characteristics of cases </strong><br> Up to 6 cases occurred in children up to 9 years of age, while 2 occurred in adolescents between 10 and 17 years and the majority of cases (n\u202f=\u202f27) in adults\u200918 years and older. Figure 3 describes the age distribution among different categories of cases. Vaccination status was known for 24 cases. Sixteen were unvaccinated (2 children, 14 adults), 2 had received one dose, one a full course of 2 doses, and 5 cases occurred in contacts who received one dose of post-exposure vaccination. Of the 5 contacts who received post exposure vaccine, one was an infant\u2009younger than\u2009one year for whom information about the date of vaccination is not available; for the other 4, the delay between presumed contact date and immunization was 3 days in 2 cases, 6 and 12 days for the remaining 2 cases. Among the HCWs, 2 were vaccinated, 11 were unvaccinated and for 2 of them the data was unavailable. Among the 5 cases belonging to support personnel 2 were unvaccinated and the status was unknown for the remaining 3. Genotyping was available for 3 cases: genotype B3, subtype 3.1 was found in all of them.<br><br><strong> Conclusion and recommendations -</strong><br> Measles elimination in Europe, despite the immunization efforts, is still jeopardized by recurrent outbreaks in susceptible populations 4-7. Nosocomial transmission of measles is an important and emerging way of spreading the infection 8-11. Anyone staying in the hospital environment, regardless of role, can be affected because measles is highly contagious and persists in the environment for up to 2 hours, thus requiring appropriate and timely infection control measures 12,13. Considering that transmission may occur 3 days before the onset of rash, early diagnosis when only non-specific preliminary symptoms (cough, coryza and conjunctivitis) are present is crucial for containing the outbreak 14. A single exposure window, that occurred 2 weeks after the admission of the index case, when 2 cases were present in the ED, resulted in further 15 cases. Appropriate procedures are needed for patients with suspect transmissible infection in the ED, an issue not limited to measles but shared with several other highly infective conditions 13. A 2-dose vaccination is the most effective measure to prevent measles 15. This is of crucial importance for HCWs, with a view to their higher risk of exposure and of transmission to vulnerable patients. However, it should be noted that in at least 5 cases in this outbreak, measles occurred in personnel working in the hospital environment in support functions, highlighting the need to take into consideration the role of such personnel in the spread of the infection. Given that most of the support personnel belong to outsourced services, coordination is needed between occupational health unit and occupational health responsible of outsourced services.  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail The full report can be found at the source URL. - Mod.ML There is no doubt that inadequate immunization levels are the major contributor to outbreaks of measles. Most of this is due to not receiving the 2 doses of vaccine due to personal or parenteral choice. Aggressive programs to reverse this unfortunate trend are needed to prevent outbreaks of this potentially lethal disease. The nosocomial setting as reflected in the 3rd post represents a special case situation. It is not clear why health care workers are not required to be immunized for measles. Additionally, when a case of measles is introduced into a health care facility, it has been my experience that the infection is not recognized promptly to minimize nosocomial spread. - Mod.LL   .

The 63-year-old man, whose name could not be disclosed due to confidentiality issues, was admitted on 7 Aug 2017 after he was transferred from a private hospital where he had been admitted on 4 Aug 2017. Acting health permanent secretary Bertha Katjivena confirmed the death, saying the deceased had 1st complained of a headache, chills, body aches, nausea and vomiting. She said the man had travelled from the Uukwandongo village in the Okahao district of the Omusati region to Windhoek for an event on 1 Aug 2017. \"He had a history of a tick bite about a week and a half prior but travelled to Windhoek for the event,\" Katjivena said. She added that the reason they could not act promptly was that \"after he was transferred to the Windhoek Central Hospital, blood samples were sent to South Africa for testing.\" Investigations are now underway also involving the agriculture ministry through its veterinary services. \"The investigation will be done in the district where the deceased came from in the Omusati region. An active case search is ongoing, and the people at the village are being closely monitored. All individuals who came into contact with the deceased are being monitored on a daily basis,\" Katjivena stated. This is the 3rd case of the fever reported in Namibia this year 2017. In February 2017, a Gobabis farmworker (26) also died from Congo fever at the Gobabis District Hospital. The unidentified man died 2 days later after being admitted to hospital after he vomited blood. He was treated for fever, diarrhoea, and coughing a few days before his hospitalisation after being bitten by a tick. Following the man's death, a 2nd case of Congo fever was also reported in the Omaheke region, when a 19-year-old male from the Okongoua village was also bitten by a tick. The teenager survived after spending days in isolation. A person with Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever can have sudden on-set of high fever, headache, back pain, joint pain, abdominal pain, dizziness (feeling like you are losing your balance and about to fall), neck pain and stiffness, bleeding, bruising, or a rash. The sick person would have been in contact with a person who has similar symptoms or animals infested with ticks, or would have had a tick bite. The person may also have nausea, vomiting, a sore throat and mood swings. Byline: Nomhle Kangootui  <br><br>Communicated by: ProMED-mail\\. Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever transmitted by ticks. It can be responsible for severe outbreaks in humans, but it is not pathogenic for ruminants, their amplifying hosts. Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) spreads to humans either by tick-bites or through contact with viraemic animal tissues during and immediately post-slaughter. CCHF outbreaks constitute a threat for public health services because of epidemic potential, high case fatality ratios (10-40 percent), potential for nosocomial outbreaks, and difficulties in treatment and prevention. CCHF is endemic in all of Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and in Asia south of the 50th parallel north, the geographic limit of the genus _Hyalomma_, the principal tick vector  . It is difficult to prevent or control CCHF infection in animals and ticks as the tick-animal-tick cycle usually goes unnoticed and the infection in domestic animals is usually not apparent. Furthermore, the tick vectors are numerous and widespread, so tick control with acaricides (chemicals intended to kill ticks) is only a realistic option for well-managed livestock production facilities. There are no vaccines available for use in animals. Although an inactivated, mouse brain-derived vaccine against CCHF has been developed and used on a small scale in eastern Europe, there is currently no safe and effective vaccine widely available for human use. In the absence of a vaccine, the only way to reduce infection in people is by raising awareness of the risk factors and educating people about the measures they can take to reduce exposure to the virus. Health-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed CCHF, or handling specimens from them, should implement standard infection control precautions. These include basic hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment, safe injection practices and safe burial practices. As a precautionary measure, health-care workers caring for patients immediately outside the CCHF outbreak area should also implement standard infection control precautions. Samples taken from people with suspected CCHF should be handled by trained staff working in suitably equipped laboratories. Recommendations for infection control while providing care to patients with suspected or confirmed Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever should follow those developed by WHO for Ebola and Marburg haemorrhagic fever. - Mod.UBA   .

Counties hardest hit include Harris (35), Bexar (21), and Tarrant (14). Long-lasting illnesses caused by the parasite, with symptoms like watery diarrhea, loss of appetite, and fatigue, have been seen in various parts of the state and have prompted public health experts to advise health care providers and the public to be aware of the symptoms and pursue testing when needed. Past outbreaks have been associated with imported fresh produce, and disease investigators are busy gathering information about the current illnesses as they attempt to determine whether there is a common source for the current outbreak. Cyclosporiasis is an intestinal illness caused by consuming food or water contaminated with the microscopic cyclospora parasite. The main symptom is watery diarrhea lasting a few days to a few months. Additional symptoms may include loss of appetite, fatigue, weight loss, abdominal cramps, bloating, increased gas, nausea, vomiting, and a low fever. Symptoms may come and go multiple times over a period of weeks or months. If this outbreak is comparable to previous outbreaks, imported lettuce and sprouts may be the source.

Chad has not reported polio cases since June 2000. The viruses detected in Chad are genetically close to viruses circulating in north-eastern Nigeria in 2002 and 2003. The cases in Chad follow the reporting of paralytic polio due to type 1 poliovirus from Burkina Faso, Togo and Ghana earlier this year. Viruses found in these three countries, which also had not reported wild poliovirus for more than two years, are genetically related to type 1 virus circulating in northern Nigeria and southern Niger in 2002 and 2003.  Nigeria is one of the three remaining poliovirus reservoirs in the world and poses a high risk of re-infecting polio-free areas in the entire west and central Africa.  WHO is currently working with Ministries of Health in Chad and Cameroun to plan for synchronized sub-national immunization campaigns targeting children aged under 5 years with Oral Polio Vaccine starting 11 November. It is critical that every child is reached during these activities to ensure that population immunity is high enough to prevent spread of imported virus and protect against further importations.

South Sudan  In South Sudan, 2 cases due to cVDPV type 2 (cVDPV2) have been confirmed. The strains were isolated from 2 acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases in Unity state, with onset of paralysis on 9 September and 12 September 2014, respectively. In Unity state, as many as 33% of children remain under-immunized against poliovirus. Both cases are from an internally-displaced persons camp in Unity state. Unity state has been affected by civil unrest, leading to population displacements and declining vaccination coverage in most of the areas.  In 2014, South Sudan has been participating in regional Horn of Africa outbreak response, given the risk posed by an ongoing wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) outbreak affecting the region (with cases in 2014 in parts of Somalia and Ethiopia). Two National Immunization Days (NIDs) were conducted in April (with trivalent oral polio vaccine \u2013 OPV) and May (with bivalent OPV). In response to confirmation of the cVDPV2, NIDs were held on 4 November with trivalent OPV and further Subnational Immunization Days (SNID) covering the 3 states with civil unrest (Unity, Upper Nile and Jonglei) are planned for 2 December 2014 and January 2015 with trivalent OPV. The objective is to rapidly stop the cVDPV2 in the internally-displaced persons camp and prevent further spread, while further boosting immunity to type 1 polio and minimize risk of re-infection from other parts of the Horn of Africa.  Madagascar  In Madagascar, cVDPV type 1 (cVDPV1) has been confirmed after the virus was isolated from 1 case of AFP (onset of paralysis on 29 September 2014) and 3 healthy contacts. The most recent supplementary immunization activities in Madagascar were conducted in December 2011/January 2012. SNIDs are planned for December, with NIDs to be held in January 2015. An estimated more than 25% of children remain under-immunized against poliovirus in the country. Madagascar was previously affected by a cVDPV2 outbreak in 2001/2002 (resulting in 5 cases) and in 2005 (resulting in 5 cases). A VDPV was also isolated during a research study among healthy children in Toliara I in 2011. Concerted outbreak response each time rapidly stopped those events. However, repeated emergence of separate cVDPV events underscores the risk of these events occurring in populations which are not fully immunized and of the importance of maintaining high levels of vaccination coverage.  WHO risk assessment  Circulating VDPVs are rare but well-documented strains of poliovirus which can emerge in some populations which are inadequately immunized. Due to the small risk of cVDPVs, use of OPV must be stopped to secure a lasting polio-free world. OPV will be withdrawn in a phased manner, beginning with the removal of type 2-containing OPV. The type 2 component contained in trivalent OPV accounts for 90% of all cVDPV cases.  In South Sudan, given that the cases detected are in an internally-displaced persons camp which can be accessed for vaccination, the World Health Organization (WHO) assesses the risk of international spread of the cVDPV2 from South Sudan to be low. However, the risk of international spread would increase if other areas are infected by the cVDPV2. With regard to Madagascar, given the history associated with previous cVDPVs, WHO assesses the risk of international spread from Madagascar to be low.  WHO advice  It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for AFP cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.  WHO\u2019s International Travel and Health recommends that all travelers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel.

Sanofi Pasteur, the manufacturer of the only yellow fever YF vaccine (YF-VAX) licensed in the United States, has announced that their stock of YF-VAX is totally depleted as of Mon 24 Jul 2017. YF-VAX for civilian use will be unavailable for ordering from Sanofi Pasteur until mid-2018, when their new manufacturing facility is expected to be completed. However, YF-VAX might be available at some clinics for several months, until remaining supplies at those sites are exhausted. In anticipation of this temporary total depletion, in 2016, Sanofi Pasteur submitted an expanded access investigational new drug application to the Food and Drug Administration to allow for importation and use of Stamaril. The Food and Drug Administration accepted Sanofi Pasteur's application in October 2016. Manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur in France, Stamaril is not licensed in the United States, but is licensed and distributed in approximately 70 countries, and has comparable efficacy and safety to YF-VAX (1). During the interim period until YF-VAX is available again for use in the United States, Stamaril will be available in a limited number of designated clinics, selected to provide access to vaccine in US states and certain territories (1). Clinicians and travelers can find clinics offering Stamaril vaccine and those clinics that might have remaining doses of YF-VAX online at  . Consideration will be given to adding more clinics if critical gaps in vaccine access are identified. CDC and Sanofi Pasteur continue to collaborate on contingency planning to address this situation. Information about which countries require yellow fever vaccination for entry and for which countries CDC recommends yellow fever vaccination is available at .<br><br><strong> Updates regarding yellow fever vaccine will be available on CDC's Travelers' Health website as well as Sanofi Pasteur's website Reference -</strong><br> 1. Gershman MD, Angelo KM, Ritchey J, et al. Addressing a yellow fever vaccine shortageUnited States, 2016-2017. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2017;66:457-9. ProMED-mail posted an early warning on Fri 28 Apr 2017 (see Yellow fever - Americas (42): USA vaccine Archive Number: http://promedmail.org/post/20170428.5002436), advising individuals who planned to travel to YF endemic areas to be vaccinated as early as possible while stocks of the vaccine were still available. This advice was repeated several times in posts of YF cases in South America. One hopes that these individuals acted on that advice. Those who plan trips to YF endemic areas in South America or Africa should consult the CDC and Sanofi Pasteur sites to determine where vaccine is available, remembering that the vaccine needs to be applied at least 10 days in advance of travel to be protective on arrival. - Mod.TY   .
