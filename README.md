# final-project

This project includes all files except node-modules folder.

Main TODOs:

    Convert css to sass, compile and minify (was not familiar with sass while coding most of the project).

    Map onClickCountry - show outbreaks found when the user clicks a specific country on the map, suggestd by NNUH IP&C staff.

    Finish UI (changed some class names and order of elements - fix menu, paddings, dropdown on results page etc).
  
    Summary for outbreak description.

    Implement MySQL database?
